1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
university

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,479
thank you thanks for coming

4
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,959
i appreciate the opportunity to talk to

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,960
you today

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,719
um what i've learned working in apples

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,559
is that it just it draws a certain level

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,118
of fanaticism

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,879
and um that can be a good thing and that

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,960
can be a bad thing and i'm probably an

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,000
apple fanatic as well

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,759
um this is and i'll try to not

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,320
i want you to pay attention to this

14
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,878
slide this is a postcard from sweden

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,200
and it makes a nice artwork but i'll

16
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,439
show you later what i mean by being a

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,480
fanatic this was also an opportunity

18
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,399
where an artist came to see our apple

19
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,398
collection she had seen the botany of

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,000
desire she fell in love with her apple

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,079
trees and she brought three artists from

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
la to take pictures of our apples in the

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,640
winter that's a muslin sheep it's about

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,039
20 by 30 and you put it up in the middle

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,280
of the orchard in winter and it acts

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,478
like a giant sale

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,478
and only the phd was behind the sale

28
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,400
trying to keep it in line and then i

29
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,159
went wait a minute these guys are too

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,478
smart to try to keep that from blowing

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,478
away

32
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,559
this

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,799
they use

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
nails to stick all the apples in i

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,439
thought when they made that that post

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,040
part so you can see the extent that's

37
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:32,239
probably you know

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,159
30 by 40 feet they place each apple in

39
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,078
between the nails rather than just stick

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,560
it on a nail so that they can use the

41
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:43,359
apples after now that's crazy

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,159
okay so another apple fanatic that

43
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,799
resulted in a lot of the apples that you

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,799
know today was johnny appleseed johnny

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,439
appleseed was a real person

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,560
uh went by the name of john chapman

47
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:59,199
he thought it was morally

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,280
bad to graft apple trees and i'll talk

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,680
about grafting a little bit later that

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,519
you should only spread seed but he was a

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,159
really savvy businessman and he

52
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,478
collected seed from cideries and he went

53
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,520
all over the eastern u.s and gave out

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,000
seed

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,840
in exchange for people listening to him

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,239
about his religion

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,120
he died a very wealthy man

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,319
but

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,319
disney

60
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,719
loved the story and so there's more

61
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,039
books on johnny appleseed that you can

62
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,000
even shake a stick at but he was

63
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,000
responsible by spreading these seeds

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,199
because apples were not native to the

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,800
u.s we only had small crab apples and a

66
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,518
lot of the colonist apples weren't

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,160
adapted by spreading these seeds they

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,039
intermeded and were selected for hearty

69
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:48,959
material and that became the evolution

70
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:51,519
of apples like rome beauty and others

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,878
okay so uh nigel talked about the

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
challenges

73
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,280
one of the challenges is we can't even

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,480
agree on a scientific name

75
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,239
the us goes by malice domestica europe

76
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,158
largely goes by malice pumala and people

77
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,840
from germany argue that it should be

78
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,120
sylvestrous

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,598
and so

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,080
apple is an ancient alley polyploid that

81
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:17,359
behaves like a diploid but there's also

82
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,760
triploids tetraploids apomics

83
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,239
we have gametophytic incompatibility and

84
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,878
what that ensures is that apple is out

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,120
crossing so you claim can't plant one

86
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,878
apple tree you have to plant two to

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,080
allow for pollen

88
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,359
spread

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,200
and

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,879
when i took plant breeding courses i

91
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,039
always heard about

92
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,959
inbreeding a trait of interest well in

93
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,439
apple there's inbreeding depression so

94
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,920
you can't breed back and retain the

95
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,199
cultivar so every cross i make are new

96
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,839
hybrids

97
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,679
and it's clonally propagated

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,598
so the origin of apple is in the

99
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,879
kazakhstan uh

100
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,119
china region

101
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,438
and it's been of scientific interest to

102
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,400
get germplasm uh from the center of

103
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,318
origin that might have genes of interest

104
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,640
and there's been a lot of exploration by

105
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,719
cornell scientists to go to these areas

106
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,719
and collect apples and

107
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,120
their exploits were covered by cornell

108
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,280
because i guess the the native monkey

109
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,438
populations figured if

110
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,000
they collected the apples the monkeys

111
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,478
wanted to steal the bags of apples and

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,519
so they had to beat off the hordes of

113
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,719
monkeys

114
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,879
the other reason that the kazakh forests

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,720
became of interest is how many people

116
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,639
here have read michael pollan's botany

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,040
of desire

118
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,199
okay if one more person calls us and

119
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,800
says i want to walk through the kazakh

120
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,720
forests

121
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,478
and it was wonderful because it got

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,800
people interested he talked about the

123
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:46,319
genetic diversity in this uh these

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,520
seedling populations of kazakh apples

125
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,680
but i think the people that read it seem

126
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,000
to think that we had nothing else to do

127
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,319
but take people through these forests

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and the diversity is tremendous but i

129
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,560
hope to show you today

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,720
that the diversity in our populations

131
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,280
is equally impressive because apple is

132
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,560
very heterozygous and has a lot of genes

133
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,719
that

134
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,360
lend itself to diversity

135
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,919
so most of you um have seen different

136
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,639
apples but the germplasm collection at

137
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,959
the usda houses two to three thousand

138
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,360
different apple accessions including

139
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,399
those from the origin um

140
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,479
of the species the curator is dr uh

141
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,918
zhang wong zhang

142
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:33,279
and the curator is thomas chow

143
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:36,000
and they are very active and

144
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:39,198
expanding the collection but also doing

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,879
very valid phenotyping and genotyping

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,120
they're looking at snip markers and

147
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,759
they're also looking at genome-wide

148
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,519
association studies

149
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,199
and what's great about that collection

150
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,198
is i get to use it and don't have to pay

151
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,120
for its maintenance

152
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,199
now nigel made me feel old because i

153
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,840
usually tell people don't tell when i

154
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,280
graduated from college

155
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:04,079
that's past history but i did go back to

156
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:07,318
an apple jean list that when i came and

157
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:10,079
took over the job this was the status in

158
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,039
1963 of the apple jeans that we know

159
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,038
about

160
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,038
all of ten

161
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,360
and even there they weren't really all

162
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,519
documented and what i hope to show you

163
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,479
today is that we've made remarkable

164
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,959
progress

165
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,318
but the sad part is about five of these

166
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,839
still remain

167
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,080
not quite investigated

168
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,719
the first linkage map was developed at

169
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,399
cornell by a hybrid of the crabapple

170
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,919
white angel

171
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,599
by rome beauty

172
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,680
and um

173
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,879
again i'll show my age the

174
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,240
apple map was largely isozymes and rapid

175
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,199
markers

176
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,800
and the coverage was pretty slim but we

177
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,240
were thrilled

178
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,199
and next in 2010 we have the apple

179
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,680
genome published and obviously it comes

180
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,879
from the efforts of a lot of people but

181
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,038
this really broke through things for us

182
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,199
so we were able to have the genome

183
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,000
sequence of golden delicious

184
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,478
and that is now available for us to look

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,439
at in terms of looking at markers or

186
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,719
genes of interest

187
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:20,759
i'm also a member of the rose breed one

188
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,759
of those large multi-state

189
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,360
projects and

190
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,000
i was talking to someone and i said

191
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,560
there's three apple breeders in the u.s

192
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,560
and somebody said well gee for security

193
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,120
of our national food supply should you

194
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,720
all be in the room at the same time

195
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,959
and if you go to japan or china or other

196
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,520
places there's tons of apple breeders

197
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,079
but here there used to be probably an

198
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,399
apple breeder in every state uh kate is

199
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,560
at washington i'm at cornell and jim

200
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,638
looby is in minnesota

201
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,519
we also have a big rose advisory

202
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,439
committee what we want to do is use the

203
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,519
collections that all of us have as well

204
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,038
as the breeding populations

205
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,878
to

206
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,199
come together and share data on

207
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,039
phenotyping and genotyping we found out

208
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,120
very quickly that a lot of our parents

209
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,360
were not what they should be

210
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,120
honeycrisp was a surprise because not

211
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,639
only was the pollen parent what it

212
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,399
wasn't supposed to be but the seed

213
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,319
parrot wasn't what it was supposed to be

214
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:22,719
and it's hard to goof up the seed parent

215
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,400
so we're using this and we came together

216
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,879
and we realized that we wanted to

217
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,198
emphasize quality and we know that the

218
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,560
most important traits for consumers are

219
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,120
crispness and crunch but texture flavor

220
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,879
however maintenance of this quality

221
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,959
through time is really essential and

222
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,519
markers have been developed and are

223
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,038
being tested across populations

224
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,959
okay i'm going to give you really fast

225
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,958
facts on the apple breeding program but

226
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,879
if you're at cornell and on ithaca you

227
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,319
should know that we are one of the

228
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,879
oldest programs

229
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,600
we're one of the largest in the world

230
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,439
we've named 66 varieties

231
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
and we very much integrate genetics

232
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,240
genomics and breeding

233
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,120
we're multidisciplinary we benefit very

234
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,680
greatly from the expertise

235
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,839
found in ithaca and geneva

236
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,399
and cornell cooperative extension plays

237
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,360
a vital role in putting out a lot of our

238
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:19,120
materials in grower trials collecting

239
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,320
data and getting the grower feedback

240
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,919
on some of this material

241
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,640
so we make controlled hybrids we do do

242
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,039
transgene technology but a lot of times

243
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,439
um and especially within two weeks

244
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,679
unlike last year where we got frozen out

245
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,560
we should have apple blossoms

246
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,879
and we go for the apple blossom at this

247
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,479
popcorn stage we don't want bees to

248
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,759
visit the flower

249
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,879
so we select one parent as a seed parent

250
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:51,838
and the other parent we choose to get

251
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,639
pollen from and i got in grief

252
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,080
uh my husband and i were dating

253
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:01,120
and i was out in the field doing this

254
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,639
process which is called emasculation

255
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,919
and he said you look

256
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,838
tired and i said yeah i've been

257
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,759
emasculating all day

258
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,399
and he said you really shouldn't say

259
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,319
that in public

260
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,679
so he's gotten used to it he still won't

261
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,920
volunteer to help but so we removed the

262
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,239
we removed the petals and the anthers

263
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,919
again so bees won't visit and it

264
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,839
guarantees that

265
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,639
when you buy an apple in the grocery

266
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,279
store the seeds could be

267
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,439
hybrids with crab apples or any other

268
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,600
variety when i make a cross i'm

269
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,640
controlling both the mother and the

270
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,079
father so every seed within that apple

271
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,519
our sisters

272
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,519
i don't know why we don't say brothers

273
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,720
but they're all sisters and i can plant

274
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,600
thousands

275
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,519
of these apples and they maintain the

276
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,920
genetic characteristics of the mother

277
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,320
combined with the father and our goal is

278
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,399
to produce better varieties than what we

279
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,440
currently have

280
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,278
but then the beauty of it is once i find

281
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,440
something that i like

282
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,879
so the seeds are planted they're on

283
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,959
seedling roots

284
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,200
and it used to be it took forever eight

285
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,359
to twelve years from planting a seed to

286
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,079
getting fruit we can get fruit in the

287
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,000
fourth leaf so four years after planting

288
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,239
and in fact one of the selections that

289
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,839
we named was 12 years from making the

290
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,720
cross to

291
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,320
um

292
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,560
commercialization

293
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,839
now those of you that work with tomato

294
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:28,319
and arabidopsis are saying 12 years

295
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,839
but it used to be 40. so we feel like

296
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
we're rocket science

297
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,480
so you see a selection that you like and

298
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,200
then you take a bud stick

299
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,399
and as many buds are on that stick i can

300
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,800
make exact clones of that selection and

301
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,759
so every fuji apple derives back from

302
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,519
the original fuji clone in japan

303
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,519
macintosh etc

304
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,078
so i take a bud

305
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,399
i put it on a rootstock that's been bred

306
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,559
by gennaro fazio to

307
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
dwarf the tree bring it into production

308
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,879
sooner

309
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,079
we allow that bud to take

310
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,639
and then

311
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,559
the top of the rootstock is cut off the

312
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,399
bud becomes the tree

313
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,559
and so anytime you see a tree in

314
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,039
somebody's yard or in an orchard you see

315
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,599
the swelling and that's the joint

316
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,879
union of the cyan the fruiting part and

317
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,879
the root stock

318
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,360
and what i always love about science is

319
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,120
i love what i do and i get to work on

320
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,600
stuff that i get to eat all the time

321
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,759
gennaro fazio loves what he does and he

322
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,159
works with roots i don't quite get that

323
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,480
okay cornell varieties we're very well

324
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,360
known for cortland portland was released

325
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,800
in 1915. it's going to be an antique in

326
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,399
two years so it's going to have a

327
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,159
hundred year anniversary it's still a

328
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,078
popular variety mccowan in 1923. so if

329
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,480
you come from cornell or bti you don't

330
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,399
call it mccoon it's mccowan

331
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,959
named for a breeder in canada and empire

332
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,320
1968 and jonah gold

333
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:58,078
1966. how many of you have had jonah

334
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,200
gold

335
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,759
hey good good crowd so really good apple

336
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,759
uh rated by a lot as a top

337
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,159
uh dessert

338
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,480
variety but it became more popular in

339
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,719
belgium than it did here

340
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,560
okay so we had a good track record but

341
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,920
what we were pleased about is we were

342
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:20,078
asked to give out apples at capitol hill

343
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:23,039
and i was competing giving out apples

344
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,958
against free champagne wine hors

345
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,319
d'oeuvres oysters

346
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,518
and we were like this is going to be a

347
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,600
long night

348
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,639
and some of the staffers whose favorite

349
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,360
apple in new york was granny smith which

350
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,120
does not ripen within our climate

351
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,039
tried some of our apples and started

352
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,919
yelling get out of here

353
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:44,078
and so we knew we had some apples that

354
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,559
were going to be popular if we could get

355
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,638
enough growers to try them

356
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,838
but our industry is a little complicated

357
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,680
we have 674 apple growers we're second

358
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,000
in the nation in production a distant

359
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,479
second from washington but we've had a

360
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,240
program well before they did

361
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,360
macintosh is still our number one

362
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,720
variety

363
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,600
and what was interesting is i have

364
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,639
some of you heard about sweet tango

365
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,278
it's a club variety so the breeder in

366
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,159
minnesota made this variety

367
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:18,320
one person in minnesota got rights to it

368
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,000
and everybody else was shut out some

369
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,720
people in new york state were able to

370
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,039
grow it and brothers on two farms next

371
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,879
door one would have it and one wouldn't

372
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,360
and what we didn't want to do is come up

373
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,360
with an exclusive variety and shut out

374
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,959
our growers and i needed money for the

375
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,759
program so we thought

376
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,078
can we do a plan where new york growers

377
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,240
will have exclusive rights to two of

378
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,120
these new varieties

379
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,759
and

380
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,919
give the industry an advantage and give

381
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,958
us some needed income

382
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,159
so we decided that because there were

383
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:53,439
674 growers we had to have an

384
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,360
organization that did not exist before

385
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,760
to move them forward we needed the

386
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,000
growers to buy in and plant sufficient

387
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,480
volume to gain a market

388
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,559
empire when it first came out

389
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,199
somebody might grow

390
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,958
five trees ten trees an acre of trees

391
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,958
and then the grocery store would say

392
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,958
there's not enough volume

393
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,399
and so you're between a rock and a hard

394
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,000
place if you don't have enough volume

395
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,839
you can't sell it to the grocery stores

396
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,078
the grocery stores

397
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,639
don't say okay if you get enough volume

398
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:25,039
we'll buy it so we knew we needed to get

399
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,000
the industry to commit to planting

400
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:30,480
enough to give 400 000 boxes so that

401
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,039
there was enough volume for marketing

402
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,039
but we also needed dollars for marketing

403
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,639
and promotion because that sells a

404
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,078
variety

405
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,720
so um

406
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:42,638
a year or two ago we formed

407
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,399
the new york apple growers came up with

408
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,720
the new york apple growers limited

409
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,879
liability corporation and we're equal

410
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,199
partners in the commercialization of

411
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,240
these two varieties we share equally in

412
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:57,198
risks and rewards royalties are split

413
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:03,519
between the corporation and myself

414
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:03,519
not myself my program and also we um

415
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,479
started something where normally we get

416
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,720
a royalty per tree

417
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,759
now with these varieties we get a

418
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,759
royalty per tree and a royalty per box

419
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,839
of fruit sold

420
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,519
and as an apple breeder to be able to

421
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,560
say that we've gotten a commitment to

422
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,320
plant 900 acres of these two varieties

423
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,559
is pretty amazing and it's going to be

424
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,360
within over the next two years

425
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,439
and about 60 will be something uh for

426
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,199
new york one and 40 percent will be new

427
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,959
york too

428
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:38,078
that are not those will not be their

429
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,879
names the names will be announced soon

430
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:43,039
we just needed to hold it with patenting

431
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,838
there's marketing plans underway it'll

432
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:48,480
be in stores in 2014 but i think it will

433
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,800
be at cornell orchards this fall

434
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,440
and the reaction has been very good

435
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:56,078
so new york one um

436
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,759
honey crisp fans here

437
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,758
okay if you like honey crisp you're

438
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,000
going to like new york one it has honey

439
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,759
crisp as one parent but is more

440
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,640
attractive

441
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,038
i'll let chris watkins argue the

442
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,679
production challenges that we might have

443
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,000
but i would beg to say that we have a

444
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,439
lot less problems than the honeycrisp

445
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,439
parent

446
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,360
it's got high sugar and has done well

447
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,360
new york too appeals to

448
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,918
people that like a little bit more sugar

449
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,038
acid balance it also is very low

450
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,120
browning

451
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,440
and it it's nice that these two

452
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,759
varieties are different and appeal to

453
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,600
different consumers

454
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,919
but the beauty of having something like

455
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,480
this is not only was the industry behind

456
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,400
it but chris watkins jackie

457
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,200
and franny um

458
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,080
arranged opportunities for growers to

459
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,880
try these apples under different storage

460
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:54,159
regimes and not know what those storage

461
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,120
regimes were and comment on the quality

462
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,759
and

463
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:00,399
these are all commercial growers and the

464
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,679
beauty of it is these guys all

465
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,840
have their own businesses so niag is on

466
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,240
top of what they do to make a living

467
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,319
every day

468
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,720
and so here's an example of the

469
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,839
post-harvest assessment where

470
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,038
we're ranking what the quality was at

471
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,359
different times hoping to draw what the

472
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:21,359
best

473
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:27,759
storage temperature would be and also

474
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,360
the the atmosphere at which it's stored

475
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,240
and then we also got

476
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,079
deb parozzio and the dyson school to

477
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,558
have students come up with names for

478
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,798
these apples some of them were great

479
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:41,918
some of them were awful

480
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:44,480
but the students really got into it and

481
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,799
it was a nice opportunity i'm going to

482
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,599
switch a little bit because i recognize

483
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,519
that

484
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,599
not very many of you are going to go

485
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,000
into apples as a career

486
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,558
not when you can work on arabidopsis but

487
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,160
i'll hope to to bring in some ideas and

488
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:59,918
maybe have you think of apples in a

489
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,720
little bit different way

490
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,720
so what if you come out of this and you

491
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,960
end up in a new position

492
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,120
and you're working on a new crop or a

493
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,480
crop that you really are not familiar

494
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,319
with

495
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,200
what do you know about that plant that

496
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:18,319
you will be investigating and i'm not

497
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,240
trying to be preachy but we all learn

498
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,720
that even when you've been in a position

499
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,120
a long time it's surprising how much you

500
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,120
can learn that isn't known or may not be

501
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:30,000
in the literature

502
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,079
so understanding variation is huge

503
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,599
so if you find yourself researching

504
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,599
anything new

505
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:38,558
understanding the range of materials

506
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:41,199
that is available is crucial

507
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,678
because a lot of studies are done on

508
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,798
common cultivars but there is such a

509
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,480
range

510
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,759
for whatever characteristic that you're

511
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,640
looking at

512
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,319
but more importantly is how to phenotype

513
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,120
properly at the right stage if you're

514
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,960
doing gene expression studies or

515
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,959
any study

516
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,798
getting the plants at the right stage

517
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,519
and minimizing the variation that's

518
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,200
inherent in every crop but especially

519
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,038
apples

520
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,519
is important and

521
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,240
in all grants there's a lot of money for

522
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:15,038
genotyping but we're recognizing that

523
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,200
there's a phenotyping bottleneck and so

524
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,440
your your markers and your genetic

525
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,360
discoveries are only as good on the

526
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,919
material and the phenotyping that it's

527
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,119
based in it's like computers garbage in

528
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,038
garbage out

529
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,359
and unfortunately this view is still

530
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,599
very much minimized or ignored

531
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:34,399
so i give an example an apple that a lot

532
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,480
of researchers had not been aware of

533
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,798
some of the visiting scientists

534
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,839
there's five um

535
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,279
i say five there's six

536
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:46,158
usually five

537
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:49,359
flowers per cluster and this is the

538
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,919
dominant the king dominant apple so that

539
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,839
what what that means is it's kind of a

540
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,679
evolutionary perspective

541
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,359
the first apple is wonderful quality but

542
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,360
if you get frozen out then those

543
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,240
laterals will still give you a crop so

544
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:06,558
it allows apple to set under adverse

545
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,359
conditions however if you're doing

546
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,918
physiology studies or

547
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,479
gene expression studies if you're

548
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,360
choosing the king flower that's the best

549
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,720
fruit

550
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,798
sometimes

551
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,798
and then you're choosing the laterals

552
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,918
you're comparing a little bit apples and

553
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,000
oranges

554
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,400
so you're not standardizing it so you

555
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,558
either choose all laterals or thin it

556
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600
down to a certain number or choose only

557
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:31,678
cakes

558
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,399
and then some varieties are very much

559
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,679
king dominant and others aren't

560
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,159
and when you remove the fruits to study

561
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,880
you're stimulating ethylene production

562
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,600
so if you're studying ethylene response

563
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,480
removing those fruits can be problematic

564
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,319
and

565
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,120
you know it sounds kind of common sense

566
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,678
but

567
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,918
sometimes researchers have used fruit

568
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,080
from a grocery store without an

569
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,360
understanding of the physiology of

570
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:59,678
what's going on

571
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,798
the other aspect that you may not know

572
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,559
if you say get me some apples or some

573
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,400
kumquats to study

574
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,119
is the crop load

575
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,480
you want a balance between vegetative

576
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,119
and and

577
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,038
reproductive fruit and leaves and if

578
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:17,279
that balance isn't there it's going to

579
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:19,440
greatly affect the quality of your fruit

580
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,279
so this is a case where the fruit is

581
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,600
very much overset

582
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,200
you're going to have reduced level of

583
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,759
quality in those fruits you're going to

584
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,038
have differences in ripening

585
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,798
so it's understanding that balance

586
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,400
environmental effects

587
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,279
can you tell me what differs between

588
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,280
those two fruits

589
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,038
light

590
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,599
okay so you're right it's the same

591
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,440
variety one is getting a lot of sunlight

592
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,639
the other isn't one is probably more

593
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,360
mature

594
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,679
but

595
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,000
knowing that is really crucial

596
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,559
it can make a difference between the sun

597
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,119
and the non-sun side of the fruit in

598
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:01,359
terms of chemical composition

599
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,558
and you want to have good light exposure

600
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,719
when you're dealing with seedling

601
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,319
populations which i do that can be a

602
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,480
challenge

603
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,678
complexity what's the sample size that's

604
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,759
needed

605
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,759
if you have that kind of variation

606
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,158
you'll see sometimes sample size of four

607
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,759
well how is that determined i had four

608
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,240
fruits

609
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,519
and you know usually there's good

610
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,599
reasons and there's a lot of great

611
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,440
papers in terms of sample size to have a

612
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,359
valid

613
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,600
but that needs to really be taken into

614
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:32,479
effect and then there's the general

615
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:35,279
variability are you choosing fruit

616
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,038
that's represents the extent of the crop

617
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,000
on the tree are you choosing the best

618
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:39,759
fruits

619
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,159
and all of that's going to influence the

620
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,158
results that you get

621
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,799
developmental stage is very important

622
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,600
and we've reached a long

623
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,839
milestone and understanding it better so

624
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:55,439
jansen did some

625
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,199
est work where he characterized from

626
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,038
the flower stage

627
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,120
to fruit development what was happening

628
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,640
with cell division cell elongation

629
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,599
starch

630
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,720
and ripening a recent paper by schaefer

631
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:10,798
um also looked at changes

632
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,798
depending on when you harvest it if you

633
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,960
harvest it too early your volatiles are

634
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,879
going to be influenced your ethylene is

635
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,440
going to be influenced skin color

636
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,720
changes acidity and starch so

637
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,000
understanding the right stage is crucial

638
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,000
i'm going to switch a little bit more

639
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,159
because many of you have probably not

640
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,640
seen an apple tree that looks like this

641
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,640
i came back from a

642
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,320
visit to a researcher and i started

643
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,240
talking about this tree and they just

644
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,558
kind of shook their head this is an

645
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,880
apple that this isn't a great picture

646
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,119
should have used a different one it has

647
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,559
usually fruits up and down like brussels

648
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,918
sprouts

649
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,278
um and it's a homeotic mutation it's a

650
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,360
dominant gene

651
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:54,159
and it gives us a

652
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,639
relatively we thought simple system to

653
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,880
study a complex trait

654
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,960
and you can see that i wasn't the only

655
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,159
one that became enamored of it because

656
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,159
we did the first qtl studies using the

657
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,240
columnar gene in 1997 i think in apple

658
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,880
and now just into

659
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,839
2013 you can see physical

660
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,960
characterization a really nice study of

661
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,599
columnar

662
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,798
hormones and find genetic mapping this

663
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,519
by um

664
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,879
our geneva group including non-by who's

665
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,200
in the audience

666
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,120
um and so

667
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,720
but what's interesting about this this

668
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,439
hormone work

669
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,720
we have a columnar apple and we have the

670
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,798
tree so this was a genetic sport

671
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,319
a grower discovered that one of the

672
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:44,480
branches had a lot of changed internodes

673
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:47,200
he propagated it he found that it was

674
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,200
true to form that it produced this

675
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,240
reduced lateral branching

676
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,319
and

677
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,640
when you use it in breeding about 50 of

678
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,759
the seedlings can be columnar in this

679
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,720
hormone study he compared the columnar

680
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,000
tree

681
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,000
by a non-columnar non-related

682
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,240
apple

683
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,038
so you had a chance to look at something

684
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,839
that was genetically similar but

685
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,798
the analysis was was shifted a little

686
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,480
bit

687
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:17,119
okay so this is where sometimes as a

688
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,919
breeder you get to do fun stuff

689
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:22,079
columnar apple dominant gene weeping

690
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,840
apple dominant gene what do you think

691
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,839
happens when i cross the two

692
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:32,720
i didn't know so we'll make the cross

693
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,720
yep and it helps if you switch with

694
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,640
the button instead of the clicker

695
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,120
we got trees that were columnar on the

696
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,440
top somewhat weeping on the bottom

697
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,918
we also got columnar but you can see

698
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,000
this is what usually happens you get

699
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,038
trees that look like cigaro

700
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,480
cactus

701
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,359
you have lateral branches but they're

702
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,440
all very upright you get weeping

703
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,439
and

704
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,400
our physiologist said you get trees that

705
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,278
really don't know what they want to do

706
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,960
but this is interesting

707
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,880
i've seen a lot of apple trees i've

708
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,960
never seen any that look like that you

709
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,640
want apple trees to produce to have

710
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,960
really straight branches it brings them

711
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,400
into production sooner

712
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,200
i think we got a little carried away

713
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,960
there

714
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,120
this is an example where you're having

715
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,440
good segregation of columnar and

716
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,519
standard

717
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,240
when you use weeping

718
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,798
you can get this is not a prune tree

719
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,278
it looks like spokes on a wheel

720
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:32,319
we think it's an auxin mutation

721
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:35,200
and um

722
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:37,599
so again we're seeing variation that

723
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,519
you're not going to read about until we

724
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:42,879
get closer to publishing

725
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:45,119
and it may offer chances to investigate

726
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,559
parts of your crop that were not

727
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,399
possible

728
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,399
so i told you that we use rootstocks to

729
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,000
dwarf trees but what if you didn't have

730
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:57,759
to use rootstocks so this is a seedling

731
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,798
that is about four years old its sisters

732
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,960
are

733
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,119
10 feet tall

734
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,840
and we have some of these that fruit

735
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:08,479
very early in the juvenile period

736
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:11,839
this are two sister seedlings same age

737
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,519
same cross one being dwarf one being

738
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,398
standard

739
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,720
and um my phd student who finished

740
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:21,519
recently is and now is post stocking

741
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,278
with la leng cheng um use some of this

742
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,679
unique material so this is a

743
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,558
four-year-old seedling fruiting

744
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,759
and um its sisters are probably 20 feet

745
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,119
high to look at ga content with peter

746
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,839
davies

747
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,599
in

748
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,519
plant biology

749
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,519
the other thing that people don't tell

750
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,079
you and i've been

751
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,519
beating about is that sometimes in your

752
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,199
studies if you're doing mapping

753
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,519
populations or you're looking at

754
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,200
segregation of traits there may be

755
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,599
lethals that

756
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,600
either the breeder or

757
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,158
whoever's looking at the seedlings may

758
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:59,038
not realize exist this is pale green

759
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,120
lethal the seedlings come up

760
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,759
they die they don't have a good

761
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,839
chlorophyll development they die and if

762
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,079
you don't see them soon enough you just

763
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,959
think you didn't get germination

764
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:13,038
but it's a heterozygous a lot of plants

765
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,360
are heterozygous for this trait and we

766
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,640
are finding that it's linked to certain

767
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,759
alleles

768
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,278
in this case these are three different

769
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,679
plant types

770
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:26,640
in the same population

771
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,960
and these small ones tend to die a lot

772
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,278
of the segregation distortion we see we

773
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,278
think are due to a lot of these lethal

774
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,119
or sub-lethal plants this is what

775
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,359
columnar looks like at a seedling

776
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,678
population you can see the reduced

777
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,319
internode length as opposed to its

778
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,159
standard colleagues

779
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,798
so i had a student that came in and he

780
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,080
was very interested in how

781
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,240
hybrids

782
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,960
coexist so when you make

783
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,599
wide crosses which we can do in apple

784
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,679
how can they coexist and

785
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,439
how do they decide

786
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,320
like the case with weeping versus

787
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,159
columnar which ones survive so we used a

788
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:05,918
columnar

789
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,880
parent because we argued that the

790
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,759
columnar gene should be maintained and

791
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,440
we could also follow it phenotypically

792
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,240
we used

793
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,720
one of the parents of that hybrid as a

794
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,278
control because again i can't back cross

795
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,480
to the same parent and we use two

796
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,880
different malice species malice fosva

797
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,360
is one of the native crab apples and

798
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,600
malice demeriai is

799
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,599
from

800
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:39,120
taiwan area and is very low chilling and

801
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,519
not much is known about it and we wanted

802
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,959
to see if we made this cross would we

803
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,519
see columnar

804
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,919
uh would we not and would we see certain

805
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,759
lethalities or genes being turned on or

806
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,520
turned off and ben archesky is the

807
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:53,278
student that's looking at it and he's

808
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,440
going to be looking at methylation

809
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,359
activation of transposons

810
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,038
and other attributes

811
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,879
a normal seedling

812
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,359
was like the picture i showed you a

813
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,960
straight shoe

814
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:09,759
this has world leaves and has a lot more

815
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,880
inner nodes in a a slight

816
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:15,278
uh area and it's not columnar but it's

817
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,520
not your standard apple tree

818
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:18,640
this is an apple tree that had 21

819
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,398
laterals

820
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,960
we don't get laterals in seedling

821
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,639
populations but in these inner specific

822
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,319
populations we're getting laterals and

823
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,679
we think we're going to get really early

824
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,439
fruit production

825
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,600
same population

826
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,600
we're seeing perhaps a columnar

827
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,639
manifestation but dwarfed for some

828
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,240
reason

829
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,399
and we're seeing very um strange

830
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,200
multiple laterals and so

831
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:46,558
this material eric richards is on

832
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,399
and mike scanlan are on ben's

833
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,759
dissertation committee and they came out

834
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:50,959
to the field and they said susan we

835
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,519
didn't think we'd say this but you

836
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,000
almost have too much variation

837
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:59,440
which can be a good thing but we'll make

838
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,519
it challenging okay red skin color

839
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,679
red skin color should be easy red was

840
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,120
supposed to be dominant to yellow

841
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,278
okay so

842
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:09,518
we developed a marker for red

843
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,519
color and

844
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,759
apple and to tell you the truth i didn't

845
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,880
think i would select out yellow apples

846
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,119
you know

847
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,000
there's good quality in both of them we

848
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:22,158
developed a marker at cornell in 1996

849
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,398
but it didn't work for green

850
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,480
and then there's been a lot more studies

851
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,038
on apple so transgenic studies over

852
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,440
expressing genes but the problem is you

853
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,480
can have a marker for red versus yellow

854
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,798
but you don't have for color pattern so

855
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,839
striping versus not extent of the

856
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:42,639
surface colored and the intensity

857
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:44,720
what was determined in a study is that

858
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,880
when you have striped apples the

859
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,759
uncolored sectors are actually

860
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,039
methylated so that's the color pattern

861
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,960
difference

862
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:55,679
so this is the kind of variation we see

863
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,759
for apple color this is one population

864
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,679
one apple from each of different

865
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,839
seedling trees and yes we could have

866
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,120
selected for 50

867
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,639
red

868
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,359
um

869
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,559
this is the color variation so we have

870
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,959
red we have purple we have orange

871
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:15,918
in this case we would have selected

872
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,919
these two but this whole cross

873
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,919
obviously has some issues

874
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,000
again one seedling from each and then

875
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,799
this is a really interesting attribute

876
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,278
where

877
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,119
we have expression of color in the third

878
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,679
layer of the epidermis so usually you

879
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,678
have color expression in the first layer

880
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,440
in this case there's color in the third

881
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,640
layer that's showing through and giving

882
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,640
us this broad striping

883
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,240
and i'm going to

884
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,760
condense a lot of it because if anybody

885
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,000
is really interested in all the

886
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,919
intricacies of apple i i'd be glad to

887
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,440
send you a pdf i just wanted to show you

888
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,759
that we really are making a lot of

889
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,840
progress like other crops mim

890
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,839
transcription factors are responsible

891
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,480
for red color

892
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,079
there's an ancient duplication of this

893
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,240
transcription factor and it's

894
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,398
responsible for the red color we have

895
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,159
some apples that you cut them in half

896
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,359
and they look like beets they're so red

897
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,278
inside

898
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,759
they're being marketed for anthocyanin

899
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:11,918
but a lot of them are really tannic and

900
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,879
astringent so if you see them at the

901
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,000
store

902
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:18,239
ask for a sample before you buy them

903
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,838
and then we also are seeing phenotypic

904
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,918
changes they're taking some of these

905
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:24,719
genes they're expressing them in apple

906
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,799
or other crops and finding out what

907
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,799
phenotypic changes are occurring and in

908
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,800
some cases it's it's really major

909
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,559
the beauty is some of those process that

910
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:37,279
i made with crabapples give me a

911
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:40,480
byproduct and that's ornamental types

912
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,519
and so we have some double flowered

913
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,599
crabs

914
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:44,960
and we have segregation this is a red

915
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,559
flowered red

916
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,679
petaled apple

917
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,759
and so um it's nice that i get to study

918
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,079
some of the genetic aspects but also

919
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,599
have a secondary market

920
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,920
we are making sure that those crab

921
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,760
apples are resistant to scab scab is

922
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,880
something that we get quite a bit of

923
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,359
time in the orchards in new york state

924
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,680
because scab likes rainy seasons in the

925
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:08,960
spring and what do we have rainy seasons

926
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,919
in the spring

927
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,320
we can screen seedlings at a young stage

928
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,880
that has this reaction it's resistant if

929
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,838
it has this reaction it's susceptible

930
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,400
but the beauty is that if the leaf looks

931
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:25,119
like that the fruit of that

932
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,519
tree is going to have scab four years

933
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,160
after when it when it um

934
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:32,239
fruits so there's good correlation

935
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,598
we've done a lot with apple scab her

936
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,118
baldwinkel

937
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,960
we developed markers we looked at

938
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,280
interactions we found new sources of

939
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,559
resistance we've looked at transgenic

940
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,680
approaches

941
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:45,838
but unfortunately 99 of the material

942
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:48,239
that's scab resistant today relies on

943
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:50,559
one gene for resistance and so we have

944
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,118
to change that and we will be pyramiding

945
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:54,719
genes for resistance

946
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,559
but it's only good if you have scab

947
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,118
resistance if you have resistance to

948
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:01,279
powdery mildew for black crop

949
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,358
with the climate change we're seeing new

950
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,200
diseases and disorders that were not

951
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:08,078
problematic before

952
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:10,480
this is fire blight which we now have a

953
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,400
antibiotic resistant strain in new york

954
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,000
which is going to cause our growers some

955
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,320
issues

956
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,719
okay so again i said it's important to

957
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,838
know variation but it's also important

958
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,759
to know

959
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,519
if there are breeders in the crop that

960
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,599
you're working with or people that have

961
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,440
spent a lot of time with the plant they

962
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,160
might know of oddities that will help

963
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,159
you understand it and so we keep a lot

964
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,920
of stuff which previous breeders would

965
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,239
throw away

966
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,838
so you know citrus can flower and fruit

967
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,519
we'll soak in apples

968
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:42,320
not ideal i don't think we're going to

969
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:45,199
get two crops out of it but interesting

970
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,599
these the parent of these two these are

971
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:50,078
one fruit from each of seedlings the

972
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,480
entire progeny look like that

973
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,880
not a home run i got my phd in genetics

974
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,358
so i could avoid things like that

975
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,640
sometimes the dice just fall where they

976
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,119
are and

977
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,118
we were getting genes for bad fruit

978
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,920
finish

979
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,559
again the same idea we can get

980
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,159
not such variation but if all of them

981
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,039
are rusted it's not going to help you

982
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,759
any

983
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:16,079
and this is an apple that every fruit is

984
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,040
chimeric so we see

985
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,560
that the fruit color is in sectors like

986
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,480
gala will do

987
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,199
but every single fruit on that tree is

988
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,280
chimeric which could be of interest

989
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,279
fruit size supposedly there's five genes

990
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,599
for fruit size i can't win the lottery

991
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,160
but i can make a cross and hit all five

992
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,320
recessive genes in one cross

993
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:40,078
every seedling in this cross is small

994
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,720
but we think that they're it's scab

995
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,519
resistant and it's certainly odd they

996
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,959
taste good and so a grower told me that

997
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,838
he could make a market with these

998
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,199
selling them as apple

999
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:53,039
nuggets we'll see

1000
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,159
okay brief glimpse at some cornell

1001
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,679
research and i'm going to make this

1002
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,159
really brief because i'm running out of

1003
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,838
time so i didn't know chris watkins

1004
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,480
wasn't going to be here and i did say

1005
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:05,358
good things about him so he's a valued

1006
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,639
colleague and cooperator as well as his

1007
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,358
cohort there

1008
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:11,598
um chris's and nigel have done some

1009
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:14,159
really oops

1010
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,480
oh i i'm talking to the slide and don't

1011
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:18,239
have it up there sorry um

1012
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,440
have done some innovative work at

1013
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:23,118
looking at softening and also

1014
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,559
storage disorders

1015
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,880
so when you see an apple in the store

1016
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,799
it's perfect

1017
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,559
when i first got involved with post

1018
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,320
harvest i was

1019
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,199
we put them in storage we took them out

1020
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,039
and it was ugly and the post-harvest

1021
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,960
guys were like wow this is great all

1022
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,920
these diseases and disorders and i'm

1023
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,000
crying because everything's a mess we're

1024
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,519
we're making progress

1025
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,039
la leng chen

1026
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:51,358
is uh known for his work in sorbitol um

1027
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,838
also looking at metabolism and as i said

1028
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:56,319
this he's looking at the sun exposed and

1029
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:59,358
the shaded part which is important

1030
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,000
and um we're lucky to have these type of

1031
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:04,319
people at cornell at our access

1032
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,679
kanangju is a tree fruit genomicist

1033
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,559
stationed

1034
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:10,799
at geneva he's been looking with lalang

1035
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,159
about some of the um

1036
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,960
malic acid

1037
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:18,000
genes and also collaborating with

1038
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,800
someone i believe at bti with aluminum

1039
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,440
and also looking at the co gene

1040
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,240
rouhailu and saili are probably known as

1041
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,039
the gurus of antioxidants and have done

1042
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:31,838
work on the benefits of phytochemicals

1043
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,320
and also which compounds are most of

1044
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:37,119
interest because some compounds could be

1045
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,440
excreted and not beneficial and so it's

1046
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,519
helpful to have them on board

1047
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,240
we can find sometimes interesting

1048
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,759
anomalies this is new york 674 those are

1049
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,399
its two parents

1050
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,119
and we found out and processing them the

1051
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,519
equipment broke down that these did not

1052
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,200
brown or browned a lot less than their

1053
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,079
counterparts

1054
00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:01,358
and so what this is helpful for is

1055
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,599
studies of apple dippers or fresh cut

1056
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:06,000
slices and so we have quite a project i

1057
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,519
had a graduate student andrea burke

1058
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,880
that found a lot of our advanced

1059
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:13,679
selections are better than

1060
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,960
what's currently out there and could be

1061
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:20,799
put into apple dippers and not

1062
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,880
have to be treated with ascorbic acid

1063
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,920
okay other cornell researchers include

1064
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,920
terence robinson who works to convert

1065
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,400
apple orchards to really high density

1066
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,119
and herbal dwinkle who has been key in

1067
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,160
doing a lot of the transgenic research

1068
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,320
so transgenic apples

1069
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,799
you can be a proponent or not but we've

1070
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:44,079
learned a lot by using them

1071
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,920
we have they add to our understanding

1072
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,240
about mechanisms of ripening or genes

1073
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,039
silenced plants have added to our role

1074
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,719
of understanding ethylene and reduce

1075
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,358
sorbitol as

1076
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,039
lalang is looking at and ppo silencing

1077
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,039
like the arctic series

1078
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,119
is of interest

1079
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,519
interestingly the arctic series which

1080
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,280
may be deregulated in the u.s which were

1081
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,759
not from our program

1082
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,839
the u.s apple industry has decided that

1083
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,240
they're not sufficiently in advance to

1084
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:16,000
the consumers to support the technology

1085
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:18,159
they support the technology but don't

1086
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,519
feel it's enough of a change to

1087
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,639
commercialize

1088
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,039
we're going to have plenty of new

1089
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:25,598
hybrids cornell orchards is going to

1090
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:27,679
have a number of them for you to try and

1091
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,760
if you find something and like it please

1092
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:32,159
let me know if you don't like it tell

1093
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,160
nigel

1094
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,519
um i really want to thank current and

1095
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:40,239
former students my technician kevin

1096
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,719
maloney my cornell colleagues

1097
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,239
funding from a lot of different sources

1098
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,039
and we're not breeding apple trees

1099
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:50,719
without leaves but it does show that we

1100
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,679
can produce very productive apples

1101
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,000
and

1102
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,000
a colleague of mine saw these and it'll

1103
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,119
be a christmas card some year

1104
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
with that

1105
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,838
i gave you a nickel tour very fast paste

1106
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,679
of apple breeding and genetics which

1107
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:05,920
hopefully you came away with a little

1108
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,078
bit better understanding or

1109
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,400
you can go back to the lab and say thank

1110
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,960
god i work on tomatoes

1111
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,960
thank you very much

1112
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:25,358
it behaves like a diploid but we

1113
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:28,078
actually have we don't have but they've

1114
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:30,559
developed haploid apples which were very

1115
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,800
interested it would simplify it even

1116
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,799
more

1117
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:41,119
yes it's a report by tilius

1118
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,838
at the university of minnesota

1119
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,920
and she looked at

1120
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:47,199
honeycrisp blushed versus striped

1121
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,440
apples

1122
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:49,439
and

1123
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,559
said that the

1124
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:57,280
non-anthocyanin portions were methylated

1125
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:59,838
and i can give you that citation if you

1126
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,839
want

1127
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,639
quality

1128
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,599
yep

1129
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:10,078
quality and a nod to chris but it's true

1130
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,920
being able to store well and having

1131
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,079
great shelf life so we've been

1132
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,119
criticized because we

1133
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,680
yes

1134
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,079
we'll keep you at a job um a lot of the

1135
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:23,759
apples that you're familiar with like

1136
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:27,760
empire or macintosh will be

1137
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,280
at harvest can be 14 to 18 pounds about

1138
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,000
and can come out of

1139
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,280
storage very low we have some apples

1140
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,838
that are 22 to 25 pounds

1141
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,000
it's a whole different animal

1142
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:42,559
we also have some a lot of people like

1143
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,639
honey crisp which has good sugar so

1144
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,199
if you like an apple it tends to be 13

1145
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,519
degrees bricks

1146
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,598
and as the bricks increase it tends to

1147
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:55,039
increase your liking we have apples that

1148
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,720
have 16 18 20 degrees bricks now you can

1149
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,358
say oh my god that would be too sweet

1150
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:03,358
but we also can take the malic acid from

1151
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:05,039
like 0.2 or 0.4 to 1.1 and it's like

1152
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:06,960
eating shock tarts

1153
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:10,000
which i figure if we could get kids to

1154
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,159
eat apples instead of those green apple

1155
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
artificially flavored candies

1156
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,399
so much the better

1157
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,318
so it's we have some apples that have a

1158
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,720
hint of anise

1159
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,639
you either love them or you don't a lot

1160
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,399
of people are like

1161
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:26,799
and then other people think that they're

1162
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,920
wonderful so we'll have a lot of

1163
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,119
different

1164
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,800
uh not your typical apples um

1165
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,358
we're gonna try to get some stickers to

1166
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,560
see if apple's color when the sun hits

1167
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:41,279
them and i i was

1168
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:43,759
the article where we did the art somehow

1169
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,519
got translated i showed the japanese

1170
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,160
where they put a sticker on and it may

1171
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,960
mean good health and

1172
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:53,440
the fruit is considered a gift and it's

1173
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,400
um very carefully reared

1174
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,480
well

1175
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,720
a news organization picked it up and

1176
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,599
talked about tattooed apples

1177
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:04,159
and they had pictures of like the most

1178
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,838
intricate tattoos but i figured we could

1179
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,598
do a big red

1180
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:09,519
apple and

1181
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,280
you know who knows

1182
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,280
just by putting the stickers on but of

1183
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,359
course i say that and then a guy was

1184
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,519
like brides and grooms would love to

1185
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:20,960
have their the date of their wedding and

1186
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:23,039
their names on an apple and it's like oh

1187
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,920
so don't expect that anytime soon at

1188
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:25,920
cornell orchards

1189
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,000
we have markers

1190
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,598
but as i showed you understanding the

1191
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,119
phenotypic

1192
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,519
base and the genetics that you're

1193
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,280
working on we need to test them across

1194
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:41,679
populations to make sure that they're

1195
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,519
not specific to the germplasm in which

1196
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:46,239
they've been developed so we have

1197
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,318
markers for malic acid that we've run on

1198
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:51,199
our populations but we're just verifying

1199
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,639
it so kanangju did that and we also have

1200
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:54,879
markers

1201
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:57,358
we're determining qtl's

1202
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,640
four different sugar attributes

1203
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,318
but we

1204
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:02,400
don't have markers for a lot of the

1205
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,960
traits that are of greatest interest

1206
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,358
because they're complex like crunch

1207
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,159
that's spread all over we also have

1208
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:12,559
markers for allergens and others so we

1209
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:15,039
have a lot of markers but again it's

1210
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:17,279
testing them across a wide

1211
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:20,079
range of materials that's important

1212
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,079
and we're getting there

1213
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,920
it's a great question and it's i think

1214
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,480
it's variety specific there was a great

1215
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,318
paper by gutian who looked at biennial

1216
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,679
bearing and looked at a lot of the

1217
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:32,639
variation

1218
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,078
but

1219
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:38,960
it will depend on all of those variables

1220
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,119
but we do know that some apples are much

1221
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,599
less variable than others so there's a

1222
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,599
strong genetic component but there's

1223
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,800
certainly a high environmental component

1224
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,119
as well

1225
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,119
and

1226
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,358
they don't have qualitative genes for

1227
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:58,159
resistance but they do have very good

1228
00:46:55,358 --> 00:47:01,119
field level resistance so for example

1229
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:04,078
honeycrisp they've just discovered has

1230
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,800
several genes for resistance

1231
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,119
new york one being a honeycrisp hybrid

1232
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,280
might have such a gene we used it in

1233
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,079
crosses to to to get a bunch of

1234
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,560
modifiers um but it we may have

1235
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,640
incorporated a qualitative gene and then

1236
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:19,838
for things like uh powdery mildew and

1237
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:21,838
fire blight

1238
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:24,159
we have good levels of resistance so

1239
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,880
it's not uh you know it's certainly

1240
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,719
going to need sprays but they perform

1241
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,519
better than a lot of the commercial

1242
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:32,519
cultivars out there

1243
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,559
this has been a production of cornell

1244
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:47,559
university on the web at cornell.edu
