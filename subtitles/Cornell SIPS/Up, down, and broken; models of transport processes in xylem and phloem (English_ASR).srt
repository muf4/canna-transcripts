00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,899
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,899
University

3
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:18,059
thank you thank you Vinnie for the

4
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:22,140
introduction Thank You Franny for the

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:26,390
invitation and indeed it's I'm very

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:30,329
grateful to vinay um and Alan laakso who

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:33,530
have given me a very interesting context

8
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:38,698
to think about for these last five years

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:41,399
grounded some of our naive ideas about

10
00:00:38,698 --> 00:00:43,859
plant physiology and its relation to

11
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,170
engineering and so it's nice to be here

12
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:49,950
and see more of the faces of

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,739
horticulture at Cornell so I'm going to

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,390
tell you about models models of

15
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:56,488
transport processes in xylem and phloem

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,189
and as I wrote in my abstract these are

17
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:03,238
both mathematical models and physical

18
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:05,569
models uh no plants though no no plant

19
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,519
models but we'll try to make connections

20
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:11,728
to what is observed in plants and I've

21
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,709
questions for you about what might or

22
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:15,239
might not be observing and observable

23
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,548
and what might be interesting questions

24
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,978
to pose with these models and so this is

25
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,409
a the work of a large number of people

26
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:24,299
the group of former postdoc Dave sessoms

27
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,509
Vinay was about to finish and go off to

28
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,930
start his own lab Olivia vents on tues a

29
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,150
current post doc Michael Santiago here

30
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,368
in the audience a PhD student in

31
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,320
mechanical engineering Eric Huber

32
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:41,368
another PhD in mechanical engineering

33
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:44,188
and Jean Comte who was a summer student

34
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:46,590
who worked with me and with a bob

35
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:52,500
Turgeon on the first example I'm going

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:54,540
to speak to you about so um first I want

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,828
to say that we were inspired by plants

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,479
and I wish I was just telling Neil that

39
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:02,548
as you look at a plant you actually see

40
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,289
an engineering system you see the

41
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,729
engineering processes there's quite a

42
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,579
lot of translation that has to be done

43
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:11,129
but once that translation is done a lot

44
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:13,969
of the processes from the molecular

45
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:16,919
through the macroscopic map on to

46
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:18,500
chemical engineering in particular and

47
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,000
so we've been interested in

48
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,919
transpiration and the material science

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,959
of what makes transpiration profitable

50
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,340
I'm going to speak to you about very

51
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,519
briefly about a question about

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,370
regulating flow in the xylem and more in

53
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,439
more detail about sugar translocation

54
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,140
the phloem loading process and then show

55
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:40,500
you a physical and mathematical model of

56
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,089
what how failure occurs and how failure

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,930
is coupled with in the complex

58
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:48,390
architecture of the of the xylem and

59
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:51,360
then point to for example recovery as an

60
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:54,958
open challenge for us and for plant

61
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,140
science to consider so why how do I get

62
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,900
money for this I guess it's important

63
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:04,078
well it that in fact um plants do things

64
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,390
that we don't do or we don't do well and

65
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:08,310
so for example the transpiration process

66
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,348
it could be a coupled into the right

67
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,549
materials could be the basis for a heat

68
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:17,219
transfer system technology that would be

69
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:20,159
extendable out to a building scale

70
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:22,378
vehicle scale and could be very valuable

71
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,568
and the Air Force pays us to look at

72
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:26,568
questions about how to use liquids under

73
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:28,798
tension in the context of heat transfer

74
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:32,280
you've heard from Vinnie and from Allen

75
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,409
laakso about a micro technology that

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,969
could be a basis for communicating with

77
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:40,739
plants by measuring water potential I by

78
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:43,560
controlling liquids in the way that

79
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,000
plants control is a topic that we're

80
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,659
just beginning with a new student is

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,629
that the the extraordinary a process

82
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:55,168
that plants use to live in with their

83
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:56,818
roots outside of the water table to be

84
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,829
able to extract the pure liquid water

85
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:01,048
that they need to live from sub

86
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,209
saturated soils that's a kind of truly

87
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,680
magical seeming process from an

88
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,750
engineer's point of view a type of

89
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,180
reverse reverse osmosis that we simply

90
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,060
don't do and it would be very nice if we

91
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,229
could so I'm going to tell you today

92
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,639
though about our thinking that's about

93
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:19,348
plant processes and I'll try to keep it

94
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,720
in the plant context as much as possible

95
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:23,699
and in particular i'm going to talk i'm

96
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,060
going to talk first about down about

97
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:29,879
getting the loading process and this is

98
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,220
a topic that i pursued with bob Turgeon

99
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,949
and you'll see that he is has a very

100
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,820
strong imprint on this field and on our

101
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,969
particular question

102
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:41,459
um and then about very briefly about

103
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,140
questions of local control of

104
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:45,449
permeability that may be part of

105
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:48,419
manipulating flow within the xylem and

106
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:53,189
finally this question of cavitation in

107
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:57,449
mimics of xylem the segmented structure

108
00:04:53,189 --> 00:05:00,959
of the xylem tissue so I'm going to jump

109
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:03,779
right into a phloem loading and um give

110
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:07,169
you an overview here from with a cartoon

111
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:10,109
from from Bob publication of a few years

112
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:13,560
ago a Bobbitt reviews the ideas of some

113
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,889
plastic passive loading where it's a

114
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,839
purely diffusive process with continuous

115
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:21,569
synthesis generates a gradient and

116
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:24,599
concentration diffusing into the intern

117
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:27,029
an intermediary cell and the sieve

118
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,180
elements and pulling in water and

119
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:32,219
driving flow a version a kind of hybrid

120
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,579
active passive process which is quite

121
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,370
intriguing that I believe is Bob's

122
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:41,009
invention his baby is a the trap a

123
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,720
trapping mechanism where biological

124
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:45,990
energy is expended in the middle of a

125
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,260
passive process to presumably increase

126
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:52,560
the gradient of sucrose concentration

127
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:55,230
and improve translocation rates for

128
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,660
example and finally familiar one of the

129
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:01,050
I think the most familiar active process

130
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,090
where you have a ATP ATP ace actually

131
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,750
pumping again directly using a

132
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:09,899
mechanical or chemical energy to invert

133
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,199
this gradient and drive translocation

134
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:16,739
and so this is a one of the signatures

135
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,589
that Bob and others use of something

136
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,639
other than passive is that a passive

137
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:25,319
species is obliged to bring sucrose

138
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,750
concentration or photosynthate more

139
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:31,639
generally concentrations hi everywhere

140
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:33,990
in the mezzo fill in order to drive this

141
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,889
concentration gradient to drive passive

142
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:40,550
diffusion whereas ah these two active

143
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:44,408
mechanisms have a way of segregating

144
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:46,538
sugars to avoid having

145
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:49,899
the entire leaf bathed in high

146
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:51,818
concentrations of photosynthate and one

147
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:54,968
of the one of the important ideas that

148
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:56,379
motivates the thinking about loading and

149
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:59,098
loading strategies the idea you don't

150
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:01,449
want your leaves with excessive

151
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:04,808
photosynthate concentrations because it

152
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:07,689
leaves you as an attractive leafy green

153
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:10,179
thing to eat for species and I sure

154
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:12,218
there are other ideas out there but

155
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:16,418
that's the one that's caught in stuck in

156
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:18,699
my mind and so in general this active

157
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:21,878
mechanisms minimize the photosynthate

158
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:24,908
concentrations and should although it's

159
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,278
hard to get direct evidence change the

160
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:31,168
translocation rate or the export loading

161
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:34,509
rate so I'm going to show you some

162
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:36,968
recent work or relatively recent work

163
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:39,459
from the detergent lab where they I

164
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:42,009
think get the most convincing picture of

165
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:45,639
this polymer trapping process and so

166
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:47,679
here we have a this enzyme that is going

167
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,319
to do a so called a polymerization or

168
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:56,188
oligomerization of the sucrose to create

169
00:07:50,319 --> 00:08:00,429
in particular stachyose a4a for sugar

170
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:03,819
species and somehow keep it segregated

171
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:06,278
here and influence translocation and so

172
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:10,479
this is an example where the detergent

173
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:13,209
group identified the one of the players

174
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,908
in this oligomerization process and was

175
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:20,679
able to knock it down and what we see

176
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:24,368
here is that indeed this this species is

177
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:27,549
a polarizer oligomers ER has

178
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:30,610
significantly more of these raffinose

179
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,948
family oligosaccharides in the leaves

180
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,599
then a passive loader which has

181
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:36,370
essentially none or and they

182
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,919
successfully knock down this

183
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:43,538
oligomerization and the consequences of

184
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:46,828
this were that um the the knockdown case

185
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:50,169
i failed to get rid of all that

186
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:53,019
photosynthetic and ended up with these

187
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:54,289
very high concentrations of the classic

188
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:57,740
passive loader

189
00:08:54,289 --> 00:09:02,028
and further this had consequences on the

190
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:05,000
global health of this knockdown case so

191
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:08,828
this is a strong suggestion that this

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,269
oligomerization process is part of

193
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:14,000
improving the translocation efficiency

194
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:16,480
allowing the plant to drive export

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,039
without building up excessive

196
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,079
concentrations of photosynthetic product

197
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:24,198
I also know I don't have it on the slide

198
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:27,859
but that they've nicely demonstrated in

199
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:31,309
this paper that these these enzymes were

200
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:36,949
localized in the local intermediary cell

201
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:39,679
or companion cell of the phloem so the

202
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:42,019
phenomenon again for this particular

203
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,508
loading process is that it's simplistic

204
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:47,230
unlike actives the classic active

205
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:50,180
process it goes through plasmodesmata

206
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,190
it's it has this enzymatic conversion

207
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:55,008
but you can think of as a kind of a

208
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:58,760
bootstrap it seems like a bootstrapping

209
00:09:55,009 --> 00:10:01,159
process on top of a passive mechanism or

210
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:04,458
putting in energy in an odd place in

211
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:06,409
this pump it has this segregation

212
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:09,619
characteristic segregation of sugars in

213
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:12,500
the intermediary cell and appears to

214
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,810
have more efficient translocation so the

215
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,958
questions are we'd like to build a model

216
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:19,219
that would couple to water relations and

217
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,409
I'm going to emphasize I think it's in

218
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,019
crucial that you coupled to the all the

219
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:26,659
way to the xylem to think about how

220
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:28,818
loading occurs so this this we have to

221
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:32,689
add ingredients over here in terms of

222
00:10:28,818 --> 00:10:35,838
coupling to the xylem on the impact of

223
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:39,529
polymerization and segregation on rates

224
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,410
of translocation the relationship

225
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:44,139
between in particular pumping the

226
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:47,899
ability to export efficiently and

227
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:51,019
segregate is this segregation part of

228
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:54,589
the the mode of operation of this

229
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:56,600
trapping mechanism and we can then look

230
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:58,939
towards putting some constraints on what

231
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,949
the plasma desmond must be like again

232
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:02,208
this is simplistic we don't think of

233
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:04,818
plasma desmona as

234
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:07,188
being very specific poor proteins that

235
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:11,509
have the ability to select between two

236
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:14,360
small molecules like sucrose and stack

237
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:16,639
eo's but here they they seem to be in so

238
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,860
we can be good to think about what a

239
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,249
plasmodesmata in this particular class

240
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:26,329
of plasmodesmata must look like so we

241
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:28,189
with guidance from Bob I took images

242
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:31,368
like this showing intermediary cell

243
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:34,009
mesophyll and and phloem and this being

244
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:38,139
the special membrane that contains these

245
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:41,269
a special plasmodesmata and we built a

246
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:43,100
new cartoon inspired by Bob's original

247
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:45,379
cartoon but in in particular has

248
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,119
particular additional ingredients like

249
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:50,688
being coupled to the xylem and a

250
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:53,329
well-defined a typically negative water

251
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:55,188
potential okay and here we have the

252
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:59,299
potential to be drawing in water

253
00:11:55,188 --> 00:12:02,139
directly into the mesophyll and water

254
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:06,229
into the intermediary cell where the

255
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:08,720
enzyme is a processing the sucrose into

256
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,149
oligomers with eventual possibility that

257
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,059
this is not which you wouldn't expect to

258
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:17,360
be a perfect osmotic membrane to select

259
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:19,818
between sucrose and stachyose okay and

260
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,209
so we're going to this has a hydraulics

261
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:25,269
in it it's got it's going to flow their

262
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:27,588
beef low speeds of the unities fees

263
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:29,869
eventually i'm not going to have them

264
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:32,269
out explicitly but we're going to get to

265
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:34,420
some reflection coefficients effective

266
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:36,709
reflection coefficients for this a

267
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:38,868
plasma Des Moines brain that's acting

268
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:41,778
like an osmotic membrane we're going to

269
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:43,220
account for diffusion I'm going to run

270
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:46,789
I'm going to run the enzymatic

271
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,499
kinematics at zeroth order V Max okay we

272
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:50,899
can do this with for Michaela smitten

273
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:53,058
but I'm going to run it at zeroth order

274
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:57,289
and then we're keeping track of

275
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:59,118
stachyose sucrose and this concentration

276
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:02,480
of enzyme is embedded in this enzymatic

277
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:04,009
rate so just to remind you again that

278
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,920
underneath everything i'm going to show

279
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:09,169
you we have a hydraulic ver a simple but

280
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,599
a hydraulic architecture of these two

281
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:12,409
components of the leaf with a plasma

282
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,569
decibel member

283
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:17,179
each coupled to the xylem and then

284
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:19,278
coupled down to an unloading zone

285
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:21,138
somewhere in the route or a fruit or

286
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,208
somewhere else we're going to keep this

287
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:25,970
very simple in fact we're going to just

288
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:27,948
say that unloading is not limiting we're

289
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,480
going to keep the unloading the root

290
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:31,758
pressure in some sense in the phloem

291
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,459
going to be 0 it's going to be easy to

292
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:38,600
unload but it's putting in loading

293
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:42,318
limitations is is a possibility so what

294
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,240
is what is the munch mechanism go back

295
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:47,628
to the beginning passive mechanism is

296
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,120
the munch hypothesis on and we're going

297
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:52,610
to so I'm going to start by a reduced

298
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,370
version of our model that oh wait right

299
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,959
now this is just the passive it's

300
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,350
passive because I don't have any enzymes

301
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:04,099
in here and I'm going to for now just

302
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:06,050
keep a just allow sucrose to passively

303
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,269
diffuse across this membrane not allow

304
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:11,479
water to be loaded into the mesophyll

305
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:15,919
and and think about the a what controls

306
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:18,589
the concentration of sucrose that pulls

307
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:25,278
in water and drives the munch the munch

308
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:27,230
pump okay and so is the four equations

309
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,568
is although be there for unknowns here I

310
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,920
need to know the flow rates of sucrose

311
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:36,620
the flow rate of sucrose enough water

312
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:39,370
concentration in the intermediary cell

313
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:42,500
and I'll just point out that in these

314
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,929
coupled equations there is the classic

315
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,110
munch process which is to say there is

316
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:50,088
sucrose get into this pocket that's

317
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,528
coupled to the water potential we have

318
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:55,399
to have an osmotic strength that can

319
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:58,669
overcome the water potential and a piece

320
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,708
that isn't often considerate is that I'm

321
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:02,929
going to emphasize is this conservation

322
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:05,508
of shook roast is that this the same

323
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:08,539
thing that's that much is trying to give

324
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:10,250
you which is Florida carrier sucrose is

325
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:12,558
sweeping away your concentration

326
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,389
gradient so that the concentration that

327
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:16,278
driving that osmotic process is

328
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,079
inversely proportional to the flow that

329
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:21,519
it's creating okay so there's that

330
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:25,129
coupling that is is is crucial in

331
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,759
closing the mooch process and in fact

332
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:29,840
what it

333
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:32,809
it we Jean a cold day who built this

334
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,940
model identified a dimensionless group

335
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:36,979
and this is one of the things that we do

336
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,220
in our field is to try to group the

337
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:43,009
parameters in a way that characterizes a

338
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,920
process and in particular this loss of

339
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:47,629
concentration due to the water flow is a

340
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,599
competition between the flow of water

341
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:52,759
and the diffusive flow of sugar and it

342
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,350
can be right written like this it's got

343
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,389
the permeabilities the hydraulic

344
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,610
permeabilities a characteristic

345
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:01,159
difference in pressure this is a

346
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,039
negative number it's being overcome by

347
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:08,019
this osmotic number and this is a ditch

348
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:10,699
a diffusive coefficient of diffusion

349
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:12,710
diffusion coefficient for this membrane

350
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,160
a so-called mass transfer coefficient

351
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,629
and so this captures the impact of

352
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:18,949
convection on the trapping process and

353
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:22,429
I'm going to show that it's a useful

354
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,990
it's a useful number to have so here's a

355
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:27,469
case where we're going to consider that

356
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,810
the plant has a desired Turner say in

357
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,610
its meza fueling keeps the levels of

358
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:33,139
sucrose in the mesophyll at a constant

359
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,539
level and we're going to ask what

360
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:39,110
happens when I turn on the reaction rate

361
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:41,469
the queue polymerization is going to be

362
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:45,320
a homogeneous reaction rate turning a

363
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,970
sucrose in the staff ghos and so first

364
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:52,520
i'm going to turn on the polymerization

365
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:54,649
with a low a low of phloem in fact this

366
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,199
is a high flow impermeability i have

367
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:59,389
this backward so that there's lots of

368
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,470
flow our so-called flushing number is

369
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:06,139
bigger than one and what we find is that

370
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:08,630
absolutely we benefit from the trapping

371
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,180
mechanism by consuming I'm going to I'm

372
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,949
going to the extreme where the enzymes

373
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,170
are fast enough that I use up all the

374
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:17,120
sucrose it diffuses across and of course

375
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,190
in the monks picture here the red line

376
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,619
being the concentration of all of

377
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,509
sucrose up between the mesophyll and the

378
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:26,779
intermediary cell if I use up all the

379
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:29,900
sucrose I absolutely improve the rate at

380
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:32,869
which I move sucrose into the flow okay

381
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:36,320
so trapping with high flow rate low flow

382
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:38,869
rate it does it's definitely going to in

383
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,740
prove or polymerization let's say

384
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:47,239
oligomerization will definitely improve

385
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:50,450
the rate of export relative to nope no

386
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,179
oligomerization but uh it there's no

387
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,429
segregation in this case I'm getting rid

388
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:56,990
of all of the photosynthate that gets

389
00:17:55,429 --> 00:18:00,620
into the intermediary cell before it can

390
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:04,130
pile up okay so here we have a polymer

391
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:06,408
without trapping okay and it is useful

392
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,720
but it doesnt it's this i'm showing you

393
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:12,440
apple on a so-called purely passive

394
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,558
loader if i turn it on the other hand in

395
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,419
presence of a large resistance here i

396
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:20,778
have this I was thinking resistance here

397
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:24,200
law a small permeability for the rest of

398
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:26,058
the transport phloem I get bolt I I can

399
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,450
use up all my sucrose drive more

400
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:31,759
diffusion higher loading rates but also

401
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:35,679
if I'm not flushing it away too quickly

402
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:38,450
I can end up with segregation and

403
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,090
characteristic this type of picture of

404
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:44,620
the the loading and segregation of the

405
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:47,720
photosynthate into the phloem elements

406
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:49,729
so this just this we've looked at this

407
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,639
in a variety of scenarios here i'm just

408
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:55,128
showing the ratio this is looking at

409
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:57,908
segregation the ratio of intermediary

410
00:18:55,128 --> 00:19:00,798
cell concentration total of all sugars

411
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:03,169
versus in the mesophyll as a function of

412
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,119
the this the flow rate the non

413
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:07,870
dimensional flow rate and we see that we

414
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:11,239
get we can we can get very large

415
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:13,479
segregation but we can also have

416
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,319
polymerization going on without any

417
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:20,778
without any segregation here mesophyll

418
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:23,119
concentration below intermediary cell on

419
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:24,710
the other hand and this is I think an

420
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:28,548
important conclusion from this model

421
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:31,819
under any circumstance here increasing

422
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:35,179
the polymerization rate increases the

423
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:38,269
equivalent sucrose export rate it is

424
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:41,240
always a good idea to polymerize alright

425
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:44,319
whether you segregate or not okay and

426
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:47,538
I'll just say briefly that we this I'm

427
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,899
showing us in the the simplest case but

428
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:51,329
if we go back to a full

429
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,550
action for water relations in a sense

430
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:56,189
and the possibility of having

431
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:58,230
intermediate reflection coefficients for

432
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,990
this plasmid as well membrane are these

433
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:06,029
same trends hold and these are almost

434
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:09,349
identical-looking plots but and we are

435
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:12,720
understanding right now is that localize

436
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:15,839
polymerization always is beneficial from

437
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:20,250
the point of view of export but does not

438
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:24,149
depend on segregation so this this is a

439
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,380
question for Bob why severed a ok and

440
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,720
I'm going to tell you just the next few

441
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,070
slides segregating is not trivial you've

442
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,319
got bills you've got to turn these plans

443
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:34,289
with Edmond into an osmotic membrane but

444
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:37,470
why it seems to suggest that there's

445
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:39,240
some other reason to segregate that

446
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:43,589
doesn't have to do with improving the

447
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,870
rate of export okay now so that's

448
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:47,069
something that we've been discussing we

449
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,669
need to continue discuss but I'll be

450
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:54,689
interested in if there any suggestions

451
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:58,080
so one interesting idea that emerged

452
00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:01,380
from Zhang's model is and in here Bob

453
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:04,559
pulled together this set of data showing

454
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,900
that a lot of passive lawyers in

455
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,509
particular trees which surprisingly

456
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,790
think trees are always classified the

457
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:15,210
big guys you have to export / meters and

458
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:19,680
meters and meters are all paths okay but

459
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:23,190
they do polymerize oligomers okay they

460
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,950
oligomers they don't segregate but what

461
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:27,930
Joe has shown in this model is that any

462
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,299
polymerization is good polymerization

463
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:33,269
you're taking away that sucrose

464
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:35,039
increasing that gradient and so there's

465
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:40,470
some possibility that these guys are

466
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,970
another version of polymer trappers that

467
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,279
take advantage of the increased

468
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:49,319
translocation efficiency without a

469
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:53,220
worried about segregation okay so I'm

470
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:55,319
going to come now just finish with this

471
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,140
topic with questions about the plasma

472
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,319
desmona so I alluded to this that it's

473
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,259
not obvious we usually

474
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:06,809
of plasma Desmond I'd be big big port

475
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:10,599
okay many molecules across so how are we

476
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:14,049
distinguishing between a sucrose and a

477
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:16,059
stachyose which a reasonable hydraulic

478
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:19,599
dimension of the suit of a sucrose would

479
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:22,299
be one nanometer and a stack us just 1.4

480
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:25,299
in diameter okay so and this is

481
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:27,789
micrograph of the special type of plasma

482
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:30,430
desma that are found in these in these

483
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:32,619
trappers but it's still a pretty big

484
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:35,170
structure and of course we're thinking

485
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:37,299
about this is an annular lumen we're

486
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,310
thinking about a sub structure but it's

487
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:41,769
not easy to see how you get a

488
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:43,990
selectivity based on that so we're going

489
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:46,119
to try to build a simple model and this

490
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,160
is partly to check an idea that Bob

491
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:50,379
first mentioned to us in our first

492
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,740
conversation which is that partly this

493
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:56,620
could be hydrodynamic selectivity okay

494
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:59,289
once we're going to have a pressure

495
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:01,959
gradient a water potential gradient in

496
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:04,000
particular between the the mezrab fill

497
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,590
and the intermediary cell and this is

498
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,230
going to drive a convective flow through

499
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:10,809
that same pore through which sucrose and

500
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,779
stachyose are trying to diffuse sucrose

501
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:15,339
is going to be going with the flow

502
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:17,710
stachy OHS is going to be going trying

503
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:19,569
to diffuse against the flow so to the

504
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,819
extent that you can bootstrap their

505
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:23,950
system and get it going if it's going to

506
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:25,659
be tending to give you the selectivity

507
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:29,110
it's going to be tending to exclude

508
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:33,070
stachyose from back diffusing and that's

509
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:35,889
what this first this is for a very

510
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:39,429
generic diffusion and convection to Zoey

511
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:41,860
flow through a pipe I appropriate for

512
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:44,500
macro scale when it says that even if we

513
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:47,409
have no absolutely no mechanism for

514
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:51,400
selectivity we can for the guys who are

515
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:55,990
trying to back to fuse ah we can get to

516
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:59,410
a ratio there's a ratio of the pore size

517
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:03,599
to the solute size at which you will go

518
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:06,179
from a back diffusion to convective of

519
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:09,418
expulsion of the stack eels

520
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:12,330
okay so this is a purely hydrodynamic

521
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:14,669
convection based mechanism by which you

522
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:18,408
could have this apparent selectivity and

523
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:22,049
segregation now we've gone on there are

524
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:25,619
we pick the simplest model to take into

525
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:29,308
account essentially just sterics of the

526
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:31,079
poor with a dimension r and a solute

527
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:35,220
that has a dimension that's not far from

528
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:38,579
our and what we find is it and this

529
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:41,249
impacts as our changes it impacts both

530
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:45,298
the solvent and the solute and what we

531
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:48,149
can find is at very small ratios of poor

532
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:53,970
to solute so saying that the poor is

533
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:57,808
just a 1.5 fold what the solute is we

534
00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:00,028
can find that in also that this steric

535
00:24:57,808 --> 00:25:04,648
selectivity steric reflection

536
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:08,849
coefficient can give us a inhibit back

537
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:11,008
flow of the statues and in interestingly

538
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:12,719
the same model of hindered so-called

539
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:15,450
hindered transport by Dean at all

540
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,558
actually at very large pore sizes again

541
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:22,499
get can give us a purely convective

542
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:24,808
mechanism for selectivity so these are

543
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:27,868
going to summarize our the fans of this

544
00:25:24,808 --> 00:25:30,329
in in this state diagram I'm bringing

545
00:25:27,868 --> 00:25:32,749
back our flushing parameter keeping

546
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:35,668
track of the importance of convection

547
00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:38,999
through the through from the xylem to

548
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:40,860
the phloem and keeping track of one non

549
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:44,220
dimensional geometry and piece of

550
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:47,490
information the pore size to the solute

551
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:50,509
sub and these are for these boundaries

552
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:55,589
are these lines or boundaries between

553
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:58,169
huge sea of non segregating cases and a

554
00:25:55,589 --> 00:26:00,028
very small set of parameters that give

555
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:02,399
us segregation this is what i mean by is

556
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:05,659
not it's not easy to segregate to

557
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:08,638
segregate with a within the presence of

558
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:10,769
with this hindered transport model you

559
00:26:08,638 --> 00:26:13,569
have to be at very low through flow

560
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:15,430
rates of water and there

561
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:19,149
very small ratios of the poor to the

562
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:21,549
solute sighs okay so if we take on a

563
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:24,940
typical ratio of stachyose to sucrose of

564
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:28,210
1.4 the poor has to just be a couple

565
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:31,660
nanometers across okay and let me remind

566
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:35,470
you that the poor is not this is a

567
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:39,040
picture that Bob pointed us to of this

568
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:41,890
annular region with obstructions in the

569
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:44,649
form of proteins okay that are coming

570
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:46,660
the plasma death mode has two membranes

571
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:50,200
it's this annular region that's free and

572
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:52,750
these we can think of as nano channels

573
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,450
and not just micro channels passing

574
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:58,359
passing in between this obstacle course

575
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,759
of protruding pro teams all right it's

576
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,949
as far as we know this is about how well

577
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:04,779
we understand that architecture okay

578
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,840
this blurry transmission electron

579
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:11,470
micrograph okay what we're pointing to

580
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:13,689
here is that within that bar if we're

581
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,839
going to if we're going to see we're

582
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:20,080
going to see a segregation we're going

583
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:21,609
to be at these those effective openings

584
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,879
between those proteins are going to be

585
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:29,500
very small indeed i'll just point out

586
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,900
that if we avoid his urance a week early

587
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,880
convective segregation can occur but

588
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,650
only for unrealistically large

589
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,990
differences in the size of the two

590
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:40,900
solute okay we can open up another

591
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:43,990
region where segregation occurs but it's

592
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:46,300
it's which seemed to be is pointing

593
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,670
again to the need for some sort of

594
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:50,319
selectivity at this point I'm putting it

595
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,560
into the difference in size of the two

596
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:58,450
these two molecules which is not

597
00:27:53,559 --> 00:28:00,819
realistic so um Sutton the summary

598
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:04,600
summarize I think you don't have to go

599
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:07,689
far in terms of building a model in on

600
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:10,000
top of munch type ideas but you do need

601
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:11,710
to bring in water relations you do need

602
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,809
to bring in the xylem you do need to

603
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,910
bring in the convection that is the

604
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:17,629
through convection that is from the

605
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:21,680
xylem down into the trans

606
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:23,810
flow importantly oligomerization is

607
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,880
always a good idea if you're a passive

608
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:29,210
learner with some plastic paths it

609
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,670
always makes sense to do that um and

610
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:33,590
maybe a bunch of passive floaters that

611
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:36,019
we had not been thought of in this way

612
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:39,019
or in fact taking the advantage of this

613
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:40,609
the other hand are segregation is a

614
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:43,160
mystery from my point of view right now

615
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:45,769
Bob can have to explain it to me and

616
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,050
that finally their plasma Desmond in

617
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:50,150
some sense can be brought down to a

618
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:53,180
scale where they act like a poor protein

619
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:56,000
like a selected for proof and to do that

620
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:58,910
you not surprisingly have to get down to

621
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,799
a molecular scale now right now we have

622
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:03,410
essentially a billiard ball kind of

623
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:07,039
model of transport flow planning Deborah

624
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:09,230
but it points to the need in particular

625
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,299
you can't just have convective

626
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,309
selectivity you do need some what is

627
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:19,039
essentially a chemical like selectivity

628
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:20,629
in that plasmid as well membrane so i'll

629
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:26,599
be happy are there any questions right

630
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:29,150
now I'm just going to speed ahead

631
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:32,029
okay so I'm just going to go very

632
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:35,000
briefly through an idea that we explored

633
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:38,500
with Michael Santiago and vinay up that

634
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,019
is an observation in the literature that

635
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:44,808
the border pit membranes change their

636
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:48,099
permeability as a function of the

637
00:29:44,808 --> 00:29:50,779
composition of this of the xylem sap and

638
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:52,519
one proposal for why they might be doing

639
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:54,678
this is is that the plan could actually

640
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:57,079
be modifying the composition of asylum

641
00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:00,019
sap to change the permeability of its

642
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:02,240
xylem and direct flows within the xylem

643
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:05,240
tissue conduct at issue to deal with for

644
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,940
example gradients in composition of the

645
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,849
soil water potential thermal gradients

646
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,558
and so this is a classic this is an

647
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:17,269
observation of Martin Zimmerman in that

648
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:20,918
in the 70s it was followed up by magic

649
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:23,629
and magics maneki and macey holbrook a

650
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:26,509
little over 10 years ago and very

651
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:29,780
cleanly showed that with respect to

652
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:31,849
ionic strength millimolar zuv ionic

653
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:33,470
strength the permeability of xylem

654
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:37,240
tissue which is supposed to be this

655
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:40,519
passive conduit in fact changes okay and

656
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,250
in for example resistance goes down as

657
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:46,129
ionic strength goes up resistance goes

658
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:47,960
down with that pH going down so we're

659
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:50,780
coupling to some chemical characteristic

660
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,069
of the asylum and in this work an

661
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:54,710
important piece of this work is they

662
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:56,509
isolated passage through an individual

663
00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:00,110
borrow pit membrane and showed that this

664
00:30:56,509 --> 00:31:02,150
remained true and so they pinpointed the

665
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:04,729
border pit membrane as the source of

666
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:06,650
this variability they had a very clean

667
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,058
story they got into science you know

668
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:10,970
that that still have to have a clean

669
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:13,220
story since then the story is not so

670
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,569
clean in particular kosher and many

671
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,000
others have found that they their

672
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:21,939
species in which the this so-called ion

673
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,730
effect is backwards 0 and so on and so

674
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:28,640
what we're seeing just to clarify what

675
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:30,769
we're seeing here is the flow rate on

676
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:36,110
here a normalized flow rate with respect

677
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:37,700
to the zero ionic strength case so I'm

678
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:40,339
just going to point out that

679
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:43,840
you can see this in the paper that we

680
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:48,408
just came out that we looked at

681
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:50,209
explanation of this based on the what

682
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:53,630
so-called electrokinetic phenomena and

683
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,919
I'm pointing this out party to remind

684
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:57,049
you or make you aware of the fact that

685
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:59,899
there are electric fields in plants

686
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:02,269
during transpiration okay why well

687
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:04,579
because plant tissues are charged

688
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:05,750
essentially all tissues all materials

689
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:07,609
are charged in the presence of water

690
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:11,450
plant tissues are going to be negative

691
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:15,138
because of carboxylic acid groups in

692
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:19,460
particular ah and as you convict through

693
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:22,099
a poor for example through through the

694
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,919
border pit membrane on you're going to

695
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:27,769
carry the counter ions that are

696
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:30,559
associated with the charge tissue from

697
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:32,750
one end to the other that you're going

698
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,879
to lead to a polarization in the

699
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,308
electrolyte that is going to create an

700
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,990
electric field and in the what we're

701
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:40,849
looking at here on the so called electro

702
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,899
viscous effect that electric field

703
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:46,398
actually drives a net flow back and

704
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:48,648
reduces the amount of total flow you get

705
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:53,239
for a given pressure difference across

706
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:54,888
the system okay and so uh what I think

707
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,839
it's worth whether this is important to

708
00:32:54,888 --> 00:32:58,788
any of you or to anybody this particular

709
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:01,609
electro viscous effect I don't know but

710
00:32:58,788 --> 00:33:03,740
we could have tens of millions maybe a

711
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:06,648
hundred millivolts voltage difference

712
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:09,169
over very small different distances

713
00:33:06,648 --> 00:33:12,048
within the xylem and of course that's

714
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:15,259
the polarization of a plasma membrane so

715
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:17,058
there's the potential to actually I for

716
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:19,569
for these electrical effects coupled to

717
00:33:17,058 --> 00:33:23,000
flow to be part of for example signaling

718
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:27,950
so I'll just saw that on this model

719
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,960
there's a there's a big cloud we reduced

720
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,298
somewhat from the literature on these

721
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,090
effects but in taking the ones that had

722
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:39,769
a large range of the relative

723
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:40,178
permeability uh for a charge channel

724
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:44,019
verse

725
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:46,480
an uncharged channel as a function of

726
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:49,149
ionic strength and what we took here are

727
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,878
our predictions are this dotted line in

728
00:33:49,148 --> 00:33:54,158
this solid line this is the lowest range

729
00:33:51,878 --> 00:33:56,259
end of the range of surface charge that

730
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,450
we could find be to be reasonable for

731
00:33:56,259 --> 00:34:01,980
tissues in the xylem and on the border

732
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:04,538
fit this is the high end of the range of

733
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,389
surface potentials or surface charge

734
00:34:04,538 --> 00:34:10,019
densities and what we see is that a

735
00:34:06,388 --> 00:34:12,429
reasonable part of this cloud fits our

736
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:13,628
predictions and one important aspect of

737
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:15,519
our predictions is that it's

738
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:18,578
non-monotonic this electro viscous

739
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:21,668
effect as we lower ionic strength into

740
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:26,318
the tens of millimolar range the Elector

741
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:28,500
the viscosity grows we have lower

742
00:34:26,318 --> 00:34:31,029
permeability and then it plateaus and

743
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:37,480
rises up slightly again as we go towards

744
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:39,250
the ionized water okay ah and so we what

745
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,550
we can conclude from this is not that

746
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:44,918
this is the mechanism for electro

747
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,929
viscous effect or for the ions deck but

748
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,239
that it absolutely is going to be

749
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:51,940
present whether whether its dominant or

750
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:54,668
not we proposed some experiments that

751
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,769
can distinguish them and we're hoping we

752
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:59,949
or someone else is going to do them but

753
00:34:56,769 --> 00:35:03,099
I think again the bottom line is that

754
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:06,519
there are certainly affects possible for

755
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:09,730
electric fields in xylem tissue and they

756
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:11,739
could be part of a signaling potentially

757
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:15,818
part of a refilling process or a

758
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:20,019
translocation okay so I'm going to

759
00:35:15,818 --> 00:35:23,769
finish with um are are synthetic models

760
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:25,659
of plants and so this is what we some

761
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:29,889
simple structure like this we call a

762
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:32,139
tree and it's got two two zones where it

763
00:35:29,889 --> 00:35:35,379
can exchange with the outside world if

764
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:37,269
its own that is is wetter will call the

765
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,608
root zone as dryer will call the leaf

766
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:42,849
and then we're moving this in the

767
00:35:39,608 --> 00:35:45,429
silicon I so that for example we can

768
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:47,349
measure things quantitatively about the

769
00:35:45,429 --> 00:35:48,538
state of water in this system and so we

770
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:50,309
can start putting in arc

771
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:58,380
sexual features like this segmented

772
00:35:50,309 --> 00:36:00,839
quality of xylem and so first tell you

773
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,358
give you a little update on what Vinay

774
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:06,028
has been up to and tell you about one

775
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:08,608
version of this synthetic tree is we

776
00:36:06,028 --> 00:36:12,869
call a tensiometer and essentially it's

777
00:36:08,608 --> 00:36:15,239
it's a it's a leaf coupled to a pressure

778
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:17,099
transducer and our the context that

779
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,108
vinnie has told you about is that this

780
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:21,059
is what a tensiometer is called it's

781
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:23,130
called tensiometer today we'd like one

782
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:26,789
that extend the range of function by

783
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:28,739
several orders of magnitude and the form

784
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:31,349
factor so that for example this can

785
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:34,259
become an embeddable technology and so

786
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:36,809
the key to this and this is what we is

787
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:39,028
to find materials that can act like the

788
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:41,519
mesophyll and it's in relation to

789
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:46,768
transpiration and in particular hold on

790
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:48,598
to water with a meniscus that has very

791
00:36:46,768 --> 00:36:50,879
high radius of curvature very small

792
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:53,400
radius of curvature order a few

793
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,528
nanometers so that we can get to

794
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,338
capillary pressure differences between

795
00:36:55,528 --> 00:37:04,168
the liquid and the gas outside of tens

796
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:06,538
to hundreds of mega pascals so on this

797
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:09,598
we by going into silicon we can also

798
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:11,309
build transducers a direct to get

799
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:15,028
electrical signals as a function of

800
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:17,699
stress and these can be these are very

801
00:37:15,028 --> 00:37:19,858
well behaved mechanical systems that

802
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:24,329
give us simple signal and can be

803
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:28,438
calibrated against well defined

804
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:30,239
pressures and the kind of what one of

805
00:37:28,438 --> 00:37:32,068
the exciting things that the first

806
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:36,239
results that come out of this is to

807
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:37,659
truly visualize water and stresses well

808
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:41,659
beyond what

809
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:43,969
in the plant world and so this is an

810
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:47,389
example of a calibrated device we're

811
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:50,029
here is the voltage across this sensor

812
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:52,309
and here's the pressure across this

813
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,570
sensor and here's one where vinay just

814
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:57,679
put it on the bench and allowed it to

815
00:37:53,570 --> 00:38:00,710
dry into very dry atmosphere and much to

816
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:04,639
our pleasure it failed but it failed at

817
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:07,730
over 300 bars okay over 30 mega pascals

818
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,889
and so we think this in any context of

819
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:12,289
creating liquids under tension this is

820
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:15,319
the largest negative pressure that has

821
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:17,210
ever been measured on and certainly in

822
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,340
the context of plant a plant like

823
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,860
mechanism of a porous membrane coupling

824
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:25,720
to a low water potential this is a

825
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:28,430
strong support of Dixon and Jolie and

826
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:32,149
Ashkenazi and all the others who put

827
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:35,179
forward a cohesion tension theory over a

828
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,980
hundred years ago it's kind of one of

829
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:39,109
the nice things I'll show you a few

830
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,030
times in such a system is that we can

831
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:44,470
also watch the consequences of tension

832
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:48,050
and so this is this is one of these

833
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:50,149
pockets of liquid are during the moment

834
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:54,320
when failure occurs and what you can see

835
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:56,990
here is a dramatically the extremely

836
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:00,440
violent event that cavitation or

837
00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:03,949
embolization is okay so this is what you

838
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,769
see is that a turbulent flow is emerges

839
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:09,129
in a 25 micron gap it's a few

840
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:11,570
millimeters wide here we can also see

841
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,340
for better or for worse this is violent

842
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:16,070
enough that it starts to actually damage

843
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:18,650
our silicon and glass structure okay

844
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:22,370
around the edge it starts to debone and

845
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:25,700
so that's a nice opportunity in terms of

846
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:28,159
being useful this this is the anomaly

847
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:32,389
this over 300 bars is an anomaly but we

848
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:34,099
actually have on some 15 20 runs with

849
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:37,039
running these things to their stability

850
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:41,170
limit we they all go to over 10 mega

851
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:44,000
Pascal okay so it gives us a sense of a

852
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,889
new technology to couple the plant in

853
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,300
the laboratory they're starting to be

854
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:50,420
very well behaved and this is

855
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:53,090
a work of Michael Santiago fact what

856
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:55,039
this gives us is a new new measure of

857
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:57,079
the thermodynamics of water under

858
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:00,230
tension which has only been measured

859
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:02,779
along in fact this isotherm and what we

860
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,849
can see is that a calibrated tensiometer

861
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,430
agrees with the equation of state the

862
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:09,199
International equation of state at 20

863
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:10,639
degrees there's important questions

864
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,349
about the International equation of

865
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,639
state of water as you go to cooler

866
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:17,059
temperatures and that's one of the

867
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:20,210
opportunities Vinny actually just got

868
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:22,730
one of these into soil from the Venice

869
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:25,639
lab and what you can see is he got a

870
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:30,380
tensiometer that's going to nine bars in

871
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:33,199
a drying soil uh which is again showing

872
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:35,450
that we're now at a completely different

873
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:37,279
regime for tensiometer II then he's

874
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:39,919
currently accessible I'll also point out

875
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,590
it wasn't fast it was a slow experiment

876
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:47,840
and that is one of the challenges that

877
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:51,380
we can can address within this format by

878
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:53,840
changing the geometry of this system so

879
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,700
I'll just point out I we are interested

880
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:01,300
in people with large stress questions

881
00:40:55,699 --> 00:41:04,519
okay deserts okay trees we would like a

882
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:07,000
excuses to be going to a hundred bars in

883
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:09,800
the soil or in your plant so let us know

884
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,769
so I'm going to finish with the

885
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,660
questions about failure about cavitation

886
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:17,690
and how it occurs and I'm going to point

887
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:19,359
to this there's this nice meta-analysis

888
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:22,639
across many studies that shows

889
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,130
surprisingly how many species live right

890
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,710
at their a fifty percent loss of

891
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:30,619
conductivity lines okay and even those

892
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:32,900
that don't they live it some 50 25

893
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:35,839
percent of Los conductivity which says

894
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:40,670
it plants every single day or are amble

895
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:44,750
izing cavitating and recovering and very

896
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:46,849
recently in this room we saw a the group

897
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:50,050
from Davis tell us about direct

898
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:52,869
visualization of embolism within

899
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:56,070
xylem vessels and even more intriguingly

900
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:59,440
refilling in real time within vessels oh

901
00:41:56,070 --> 00:42:01,510
one of the of course we're not all lucky

902
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,619
enough to have Lawrence Berkeley Lab

903
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:08,650
across the street and what most people

904
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:12,000
do including vinay with Alan laakso and

905
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:14,950
tearing up in Geneva is to measure

906
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,849
acoustically a non-invasive method

907
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:21,730
method of getting information out about

908
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:23,739
the failure modes within the xylem

909
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:26,440
tissue and so this is just a collection

910
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:29,319
on grapevine of the number of acoustic

911
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:32,740
events versus water potential in a vine

912
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:35,380
and interestingly what would be nice is

913
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:37,329
if we could do learn more from these

914
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,579
non-invasive techniques is there some

915
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:41,409
way to do statistics and learn about the

916
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:43,869
dynamics in such a way that we could do

917
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:46,569
the inverse problem we get the sound we

918
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:48,639
hear it can we learn about the local

919
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:50,440
architecture that created it okay and

920
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:53,019
the dynamics that created so for example

921
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,970
in this data what we'll see it there are

922
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:56,920
times when it pulses okay they'll be

923
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:58,959
huge events and then nothing and huge

924
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,639
events and then nothing interesting also

925
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,670
there's a power law distribution and

926
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:06,219
events sizes like avalanches or stock

927
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:08,110
market crashes there's some interesting

928
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:12,099
dynamics that defines the size of these

929
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:14,710
events so one of the things that we've

930
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:17,529
been doing with this a synthetic system

931
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:20,369
is to create the segmented architecture

932
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:23,350
where we have here a vessel element a

933
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:25,690
coupled through this same nanoporous

934
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:28,269
silicon to other vessel elements and

935
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:30,550
then coupled to the outside world where

936
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:33,340
we can generate stresses by presenting

937
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:36,880
low water potential and so what we're

938
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:39,670
looking at here is uh three full

939
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,190
cavities one is in the midst of

940
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:45,670
cavitating and then this guy's empty

941
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:47,409
okay and so I'm going to show you some

942
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:50,079
movies like this now looking from the

943
00:43:47,409 --> 00:43:52,179
top over a big array and what we're

944
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,860
doing is we're drawing these out into an

945
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:56,799
eighty-five percent relative humidity

946
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:59,910
atmosphere and what we were very pleased

947
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,430
to see is that we have these isolated

948
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:04,379
events ok this is robustness this is the

949
00:44:02,429 --> 00:44:07,558
proposal at the text book proposal for

950
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,900
why that is I will remain segment is so

951
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:12,030
that a cavitation event doesn't spread

952
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,670
in an uncontrolled manner along the full

953
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:17,099
length of the xylem and that indeed is

954
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:18,960
what we see you can tell that the

955
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:21,630
dynamic is more complicated than that we

956
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,760
definitely do have some propensity to

957
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:26,519
drive to cala kate moore near the

958
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,420
highest stress zones ah but there's this

959
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:33,329
very rough dry in front that we see and

960
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:35,608
so this is surprising in a physical

961
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:37,619
science context a material if you start

962
00:44:35,608 --> 00:44:39,328
extracting the liquid from it you think

963
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:42,690
it should drive from the outside where

964
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:45,869
the stresses are largest more

965
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:47,579
interestingly if you watch this in

966
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:50,640
detail what you'll see is that in fact

967
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:52,769
it doing something very regular you're

968
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:55,019
pulling in a steady manner and it's

969
00:44:52,769 --> 00:44:59,068
responding in fact it has a series of

970
00:44:55,019 --> 00:45:01,920
avalanche very controlled avalanches

971
00:44:59,068 --> 00:45:05,909
that occur of a similar size and a

972
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:09,329
timing that seems to be a very strictly

973
00:45:05,909 --> 00:45:12,019
controlled by something ok so the

974
00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:14,970
something's going on to couple these

975
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:17,159
failure events alright and this just

976
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:20,250
shows that these correlations of this

977
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:24,868
time trail of avalanches goes out toward

978
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:27,329
tens of minutes to an hour so one thing

979
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:29,640
is that we can also hear these same

980
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:31,650
events just in fact using the same

981
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:34,170
acoustic transducer that goes into the

982
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:38,730
field we can hear these events they

983
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:42,510
create a strong a acoustic ultrasonic

984
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:44,219
shock arm and in fact it has very

985
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:47,520
similar signatures to the ones that we

986
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:49,858
see from woody species and so our first

987
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:52,139
hypothesis would these events are

988
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:54,538
triggering each other one appt one

989
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:56,608
cavitation event sends a coup stick

990
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:58,920
signal and triggers another or another

991
00:45:56,608 --> 00:46:00,559
series of unfortunately though what I

992
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,130
show your correlations on this

993
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,960
10 5 10 minutes the ring down of one of

994
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:08,960
these acoustic events is just a

995
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,340
millisecond ok so these do have there's

996
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,530
interesting the fact that they created

997
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:17,150
acoustic signals but it can't be what's

998
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:19,490
coupling these events so we when we went

999
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:21,829
back to our data and look more closely

1000
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:23,719
and in particular started to look at

1001
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:26,569
spatial information about these

1002
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:28,519
correlations what we saw was that if we

1003
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:30,890
plotted the position between two

1004
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:32,719
subsequent events versus the time

1005
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:34,969
between those subsequent events we

1006
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:39,139
actually had this cloud with a very

1007
00:46:34,969 --> 00:46:41,949
clear hole in it ok that uh within this

1008
00:46:39,139 --> 00:46:45,589
zone an event that occurs at time zero

1009
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:48,230
inhibits the a second cavitation event

1010
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:51,079
in this for this period of time over

1011
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:54,019
this distance and in fact when we look

1012
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:55,909
at this envelope on this inhibited zone

1013
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:59,960
and in fact has a square root of time

1014
00:46:55,909 --> 00:47:02,960
behavior that suggests a diffusive a

1015
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,329
diffusive phenomena so in fact what we

1016
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,639
think and we quite convinced now is of

1017
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:09,679
hydraulic suppression of adjacent events

1018
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:13,670
and this I think relates to interesting

1019
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:15,169
ideas about why plants are do go to

1020
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:18,500
twenty five fifty percent of their

1021
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:20,840
cavitation a possibility in a given day

1022
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,070
and so very quickly what what we can

1023
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,920
write down and this will be true for

1024
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:28,130
plants as well is a diffusion equation

1025
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:31,720
for pressure in this medium in the xylem

1026
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:35,660
tissue any porous medium uh will have

1027
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:37,429
some elasticity in this case in our very

1028
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:39,889
rigid material its elasticity of water

1029
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:42,259
and a permeability which is its Darcy

1030
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:44,509
permeability and together these create a

1031
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,430
diffusion constant for pressure and

1032
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:48,860
pressure solves the time-dependent

1033
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:51,289
diffusion equation and you know in this

1034
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:54,079
problem this time dependent diffusion is

1035
00:47:51,289 --> 00:47:56,000
coupled to the kinetics of cavitation

1036
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:00,349
which is a function of the pressure

1037
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,179
that's being diffused around and so this

1038
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:04,460
shows what our understanding of this

1039
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:06,829
process is so here this is eric uber

1040
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:08,990
model of those equations are just showed

1041
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:11,569
and what we saw is the pressure

1042
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:14,750
the pressure dropped coming in from the

1043
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:18,380
edge creating a cavitation eventing this

1044
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:21,110
first cavity that then sent out a wave

1045
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,670
before the way it could reach it you're

1046
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:25,070
the wave is going out of suppression

1047
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:27,289
these two guys cavitate it before that

1048
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:31,400
suppression wave could come and meet

1049
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:34,900
them they all then spread out refill the

1050
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:37,250
the medium with water that's freed up by

1051
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,500
freed up by the cavitation event and

1052
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:43,030
that's suppressed further cavitation

1053
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:46,099
event for a period of time okay and so

1054
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:48,650
this we believe this is now is from this

1055
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:51,589
type of model of our same experiment we

1056
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:54,260
see consensually one-to-one match of the

1057
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:57,550
dynamics we get in our in our

1058
00:48:54,260 --> 00:49:00,740
experimental system and when with this a

1059
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:03,320
couple pressure diffusion reaction

1060
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:05,750
profits and so I think what's important

1061
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,910
is that I've seen this proposed in the

1062
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:10,760
literature this is an example of the

1063
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:12,769
xylem serving a design of water serving

1064
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,210
as a reservoir of water for the tissue

1065
00:49:12,769 --> 00:49:16,730
that doesn't happen so you have a

1066
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:19,090
vulnerable zone they can attain and then

1067
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:23,000
give you water to release tension in

1068
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:28,789
transiently in the rest of the plant ok

1069
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:31,730
so I'll finish up to connect this back

1070
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:35,630
the inverse problem we would we now do

1071
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:39,320
under one explanation for why we might

1072
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:40,910
see these periodic events in acoustic

1073
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,530
data at times we don't have an

1074
00:49:40,909 --> 00:49:44,889
explanation for this power law of

1075
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:47,660
distribution but there's a nice

1076
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:49,909
possibility now to look at other

1077
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:53,029
architectures try to understand the

1078
00:49:49,909 --> 00:49:55,940
dynamics and design criteria for xylem

1079
00:49:53,030 --> 00:50:00,080
tissue and then what i'm showing years

1080
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:02,869
in fact this same system will refill we

1081
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,509
have tricks to get this system to mimic

1082
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:07,210
refilling and that's an opportunity to

1083
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:12,460
look at some of the proposals for how

1084
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:15,400
siloam repairs so i'll finish with these

1085
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:17,570
remind you that your your choice of

1086
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:20,869
species to study their excellent

1087
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:22,340
engineers and inspiration there are are

1088
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:24,620
opportunities for

1089
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,329
oh jeez both the interface with plants

1090
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:28,579
and to go out into other places in the

1091
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:31,340
world and then method models both

1092
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:34,639
mathematical and physical like all

1093
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:37,130
models are wrong but potentially can be

1094
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:40,819
useful to restrain the way you think

1095
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:43,280
about a system that you're a lack of

1096
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:45,559
information on so with that I'd like to

1097
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:50,870
again acknowledged in particular vinay
