1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,599
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:12,839
University well I want to thank Adrian

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,120
for a very generous introduction

4
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,640
probably over generous and I want to

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:23,729
thank you for coming to hear this talk

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:28,859
which may never be given okay so I chose

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:32,759
modeling as a topic for my presentation

8
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:36,230
because it appears to be particularly

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,079
relevant and very timely

10
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:41,390
well I can I can share a little bit of

11
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,089
personal history I was looking up in my

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:49,340
diary actually in my journal and I found

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:52,489
out that within two days in 1978 I

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:56,030
actually gave my entrance seminar to the

15
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:58,849
department in this room so the choice of

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,380
gate seems particularly apropos the

17
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,149
difference of course was that the

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,609
seating arrangement was completely

19
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,799
reversed the screen was in the back all

20
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:08,840
the chairs faced that way and instead of

21
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,319
having a computer with powerpoints that

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,159
don't work there was a there was a two

23
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:20,359
by two slide projector which did work

24
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:25,489
yes so a botanist a zoologist in a

25
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:28,039
mycologist walking into a bar okay I'm

26
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:31,728
not gonna touch anything I'm just gonna

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,380
touch the clicker okay okay now I'm

28
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:35,659
actually going to turn off the lights

29
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:39,799
because I'm a morphologist and I'm used

30
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:42,200
to working in the dark okay so the

31
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:46,159
reason I picked the topic is because it

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:49,879
appears that modeling has taken a new

33
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:53,959
high road recently this is actually a

34
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:57,049
quote from a 2016 NSF report talking

35
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:58,759
about the importance of biological

36
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,009
modeling and the fear that it might

37
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,039
actually fall between the cracks of

38
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:06,530
funding agencies so certainly NSF and a

39
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:09,740
number of other funding agencies have

40
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:12,650
taken note that biological modeling is

41
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:15,890
important and no higher authority than

42
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,950
Wikipedia actually actually has an enter

43
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:21,609
the entrance talking about biological

44
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:25,219
modeling and the systems to a variety of

45
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,700
biological disciplines so I think

46
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:30,379
talking about modeling in general is

47
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:32,209
particularly interesting and relevant

48
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:34,400
but I will tell you when I was a

49
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:37,280
graduate student and I started doing my

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,550
first modeling it was actually frowned

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,129
upon it was thought to be mostly you

52
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:45,650
know smoke and mirrors most people

53
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:47,568
really didn't trust mathematics or at

54
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,789
least not mathematics applied to

55
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:51,919
biological systems the only point of

56
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:53,840
entry in the old days was really in

57
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,018
ecology where a lot of ecological

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,120
modeling had become fashionable so what

59
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:01,310
am I talking about when I actually am

60
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,019
using the word modeling so I went to

61
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,329
Webster's dictionary and of course

62
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:08,209
looked up the various definitions for

63
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:10,099
model you know representation of a

64
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,650
person a thing or a phenomenon or a

65
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:15,589
system that can be used as an example so

66
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,170
a model person a model system me maybe a

67
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,420
rabid OPS's most certainly but the kind

68
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:23,468
of definition that I want to use is a

69
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:26,568
material visual mathematical or

70
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:29,000
computational analog used to construct a

71
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:31,539
theory now notice to construct a theory

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and notice the entrance says see also

73
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:38,509
hypothesis or theory and that's what I

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,680
mean by modeling at least in the context

75
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:45,769
of my talk now what drew me to look into

76
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,590
modeling is that ever since I started

77
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:50,060
studying biological systems I've always

78
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,848
really been fascinating

79
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:56,150
by the relationship between organic

80
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:59,089
structure and function and I've been

81
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,730
interested in that for a very long time

82
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:04,789
even actually as an undergraduate major

83
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:07,579
in mathematics because you can't help it

84
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:10,879
look at a plant or an animal and think

85
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:13,640
about its structure and its function

86
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,310
that could be quantified using the tools

87
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,769
of math and physics there's another

88
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:22,550
dimension however and that is my

89
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:26,090
background in PhD thesis had to do with

90
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:28,550
evolution and so the other axis in this

91
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:31,159
interest is how the environment

92
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,009
influences the interplay between organic

93
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,410
structure and function and the

94
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:39,019
historical aspects that have led up to

95
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,870
the structure function relationship so

96
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:44,389
this actually is an interplay of at

97
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,319
least four very important components

98
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:51,889
that converge on our understanding of

99
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:56,779
what a plant a fungus or even a

100
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:59,030
bacterium is so when you start looking

101
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:03,199
at the application of the physical

102
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:04,929
sciences towards biology being a

103
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,909
physical scientist it's actually

104
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,560
comparatively easy I made a little list

105
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,810
here if you're an engineer or a

106
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,660
physicist of what you have to look

107
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,209
forward to if you're designing a

108
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,130
structure and mechanism of some sort you

109
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:21,138
know where that mechanism is going to

110
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:24,189
function the workplace is already

111
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:26,780
specified for you and the design

112
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:28,788
specifications are specified for you how

113
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:31,879
big is the machine of big is the

114
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:34,129
structure that you're doing and the

115
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:37,038
function of that structure is already

116
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:39,319
specified a priori so an engineer is

117
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,849
given a task here is where you're going

118
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,538
to build something this is what it has

119
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:46,760
to do and you have the materials and the

120
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:49,370
materials that are going to be used to

121
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,860
fabricate it and if they don't work you

122
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:55,728
can choose a different material aluminum

123
00:05:51,860 --> 00:06:00,379
instead of iron etc etc and finally with

124
00:05:55,728 --> 00:06:02,360
very few exceptions engineered artifacts

125
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:05,300
have a single function

126
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,389
and that means that you can design a

127
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:12,379
structure to actually maximize the

128
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:14,960
performance of that function also in

129
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:18,468
physics not in engineering but certainly

130
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,478
in engineering one accurate and precise

131
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:21,439
measurement measurement can actually

132
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,620
suffice

133
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,300
now biomechanics in biophysics well here

134
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,939
is where we get into a little bit of

135
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,400
trouble the environment is variable the

136
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:34,580
organism has to be examined and its

137
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:38,028
functions have to be inferred we have to

138
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:40,848
guess what something is doing yes a wing

139
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:42,860
a fin we can pretty much be sure that

140
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:44,990
our guess is correct but there are many

141
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,210
things like for example the prickles on

142
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,400
a rose these downward nasty-looking

143
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:50,930
things what are they really doing

144
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,359
are they grappling hooks or the

145
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,418
deterrence of herbivores are they doing

146
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,090
both the other thing is that an

147
00:06:56,418 --> 00:07:02,209
organisms materials and structure are

148
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:04,728
the result of its evolutionary legacy it

149
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:09,168
didn't get there de novo it went through

150
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:12,019
a whole sequence of events and finally

151
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:14,240
at least in terms of biomechanics most

152
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:16,878
organic structures have multiple

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,218
functions not just single single ones so

154
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,658
you can't maximize the performance of

155
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:23,870
the function you actually have to

156
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:25,788
compromise and optimize and finally in

157
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,389
biophysics multiple measurements are

158
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:29,120
required

159
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,889
unlike physics I often tell my students

160
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,860
some of whom are here and none not sure

161
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:36,829
I've told them this if you measure an

162
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,750
electron accurately you know the mass of

163
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:43,158
an electron throughout the universe if

164
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:46,129
you measure a gerbil you happen to know

165
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:49,009
the weight of that gerbil on that day at

166
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:51,169
that time okay so we have many

167
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,259
challenges not the least of which is

168
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:56,658
that many biological models appear

169
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:59,300
overly simplistic because of the

170
00:07:56,658 --> 00:08:01,550
multitude of functions that organisms

171
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,860
even a single cell has to perform I mean

172
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,009
the classic example there is assume a

173
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,990
spherical cow existing in a vacuum you

174
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:12,800
know this is what a lot of us sometimes

175
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:14,840
do imagine a spherical plant existing in

176
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,360
a vacuum well I can imagine it but I'm

177
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,519
going to find when I suppose the thing

178
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,340
is that things have certainly been

179
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,589
improved not improved improved and that

180
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:26,478
is our modeling techniques are a lot

181
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:30,259
more sophisticated with the rise of

182
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:33,080
computational sophistication computers

183
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:35,149
now can handle datasets that in my day

184
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,860
nobody would ever accumulate because

185
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,838
they knew they couldn't do a single

186
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:43,399
linear regression on it because in my

187
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:46,550
day you had to do it by hand the other

188
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:49,220
problem that we face is that models can

189
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:51,889
give the correct answers for the wrong

190
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:55,009
reason I'm giving you an example here of

191
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:58,309
Ptolemies astrolabe this little device

192
00:08:55,009 --> 00:09:00,259
shown over here completely accurate

193
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:02,750
it could predict the motion of the

194
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:04,580
planets the known planets in those days

195
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,700
it could predict solar and lunar

196
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,379
eclipses with perfect fidelity to

197
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,110
reality there's only one little problem

198
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:14,419
it was a geocentric device it assumes

199
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,250
that the earth was in the center of the

200
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:18,669
solar system so he gave you the right

201
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,500
answers but from a mechanistic

202
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:24,528
understanding of the solar system was

203
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,899
totally wrong okay so with all of these

204
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:29,088
caveats in mind I'd like to give you a

205
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:32,360
few examples of the kind of modeling

206
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:34,130
that I did starting way back when when

207
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,339
most of you at least the young Lawrence

208
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:39,139
weren't even born I feel totally

209
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:41,209
antiquated the first one I want to talk

210
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:44,149
about is tissues in d-formation and

211
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:46,250
adrienne mentioned that my PhD involved

212
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,990
looking at least in part at this strange

213
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,629
little organism called protists

214
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:53,180
underneath and these are some s cm's and

215
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:55,189
yes SEMS were new when i was a graduate

216
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:58,549
student we were all very excited about

217
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:01,490
them and these are sem micrographs of

218
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:03,620
this fragments of this organism called

219
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,899
protists Affinia it's an upper Devonian

220
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:09,080
thing nobody really knows whether it's

221
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:10,759
an alga a liverwort or what but one of

222
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:15,740
the things that I was fascinated with

223
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:18,799
was it if you look here you can make out

224
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,549
cellular texture you can actually see

225
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,958
how those cells seems to seem to have

226
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:26,429
been aligned with each other and I've

227
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:31,199
blown it up here and those are little

228
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:34,109
black pencil marks looking at the arcs

229
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,170
of these different cells and I said to

230
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:40,409
myself self what can we do with these

231
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:42,360
data and the new technique that I became

232
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:45,389
aware of what's called finite element

233
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,720
analysis and finite element analysis is

234
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:51,899
where you make up essentially grids with

235
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,350
properties within each of these areas

236
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:57,539
that in my particular case where the

237
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,269
dimensions of these cells you spend many

238
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:02,278
nights with a microscope measuring the

239
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:05,069
size and the shape of these cells and

240
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:08,088
then you mesh things up and you create

241
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:11,399
based on the information that you have a

242
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:14,880
hypothetical apical meristem this by the

243
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:18,269
way is a finite element simulation of

244
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,458
what I thought the meristem looked like

245
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:23,970
and the beauty with finite elements is

246
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:27,329
that you can say grow make this thing

247
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,790
bigger construct what the organism might

248
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,400
have looked like and I just want to go

249
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:34,289
back one or a few slides and point out

250
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,850
that you'll notice there are things here

251
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:38,639
that are very different in shape

252
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,950
they're vile obe things and squashed

253
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,458
things things that look like Mickey

254
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,190
Mouse's ears until I came along those

255
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:49,739
were all described as separate species

256
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:52,740
proto salvinia Ravena proto Sylvania

257
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,769
arnoldii I produce salvinia FERC Ada and

258
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,990
I said well maybe my little computer

259
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:00,389
simulation will generate one of these

260
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,299
things and I'll be vindicated to get at

261
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:05,669
least part of a mini PhD well it turned

262
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:08,549
out that the computer simulations told

263
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:10,588
me this all of those fragments belong to

264
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:13,439
the same organism all of them could be

265
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:16,110
generated by manipulating the cell

266
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,360
divisions in the apical meristem and the

267
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:22,259
computer simulations actually gave me an

268
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,480
ontogeny for this fossil organism so how

269
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:27,360
do you validate this it's just pie in

270
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,550
the sky you actually go and look for the

271
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:34,230
intermediate stages that we're never

272
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:36,750
given a name a species name and MIT

273
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,459
because after macerating tons of

274
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,519
material I did manage to find

275
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,338
intermediates

276
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,649
and so my PhD committees sort of said

277
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:47,260
well yeah this is a computer simulation

278
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:52,389
it's not really paleobotany but okay

279
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:54,580
leave us as Adrian also mentioned I was

280
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:57,189
doing some organic geochemistry then I

281
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,920
was a dilettante I was just trying to

282
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,380
learn stuff and we had at the University

283
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:05,229
of Illinois a beautiful mass spec and so

284
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:07,179
we prepared specimens vaporized them did

285
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,120
all sorts of stuff and I managed to

286
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:12,789
isolate a number of compounds that are

287
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,879
thus far only known for land plants and

288
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:18,250
so it's likely even though this has

289
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,409
nothing to do with modeling it's likely

290
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,200
that protists have any lived on land

291
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:24,699
does that make it not an alga no but is

292
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,350
it not mutually exclusive there's

293
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,820
nothing in the definition of an alga

294
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,839
that says you can't live on land

295
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:35,940
it's just prejudice so we got I got

296
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,940
interested then Oh No

297
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:50,370
I see what the problem is the problem is

298
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:53,258
we have a loose connection and I'm it I

299
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:56,499
will not touch this computer again

300
00:13:53,259 --> 00:14:00,759
except to start the show so I was

301
00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:03,100
interested in yes

302
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:04,930
shaky hands because you might not know

303
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,569
it but I'm terribly nervous giving this

304
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:09,758
talk you're a very impressive group of

305
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:11,679
people so I started looking at issues

306
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,528
later on after I actually came to

307
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,568
Cornell thinking about finite element

308
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:18,938
analyses and how I could apply to living

309
00:14:16,568 --> 00:14:21,818
plants and I was fascinated by hollow

310
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:24,188
things including my cranium but if if

311
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:26,558
you look if you look at a variety of

312
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:28,870
plants including a cuisine and you will

313
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:31,600
see that hollow stems are actually a

314
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,860
very common turns out from an

315
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,839
engineering point of view they're

316
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,019
perfect because if you bend or twist

317
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:40,360
something like a hollow stem if you look

318
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:42,188
at the distribution this is the maximum

319
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,350
these are always towards the outside and

320
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:46,208
the inside they're zero so there's no

321
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,189
reason to have stuff on the inside since

322
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:50,619
it's not providing any mechanical

323
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:52,389
support of any kind and if you eliminate

324
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,909
that by a mess you actually make the

325
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:57,879
material lighter and stronger and this

326
00:14:54,909 --> 00:15:01,899
is why a lot of things like bicycles and

327
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:04,930
and frames of airplanes are made up of

328
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:06,610
hollow tubes well anyway what can we do

329
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:09,370
with hollow tubes well you can bend and

330
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:13,449
twist them and so I meshed up again I

331
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:16,870
love my finite element analysis and said

332
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:21,039
to myself what are the effects of these

333
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:23,578
nodal septa periodically the inter nodes

334
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:26,649
are separated by a nodal septa little

335
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:29,469
diaphragm of cells and also on many

336
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:33,039
grasses the base of the intra node is

337
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:35,528
classed by the base of the leaf the leaf

338
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,509
sheath and I wanted to know well what

339
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:40,240
are the contributions of these things

340
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:43,300
and so we twisted and we bent and we

341
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,399
looked at finite element simulations and

342
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:49,808
it turns out that the nodal septa

343
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:52,568
provide almost 25% of the mechanical

344
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:53,919
support of these structures they act as

345
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:56,199
struts

346
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,208
that actually absorb bending and

347
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,310
twisting energy they absorb the strain

348
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:03,909
energy and when the applied force is

349
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:06,009
removed they act like a spring they pop

350
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:09,309
back into place and we could actually

351
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:11,889
show this using real plants and

352
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:15,429
measuring with strain gauges the

353
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:17,829
importance of those diaphragms one of

354
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:21,458
the secretaries here many years ago Joan

355
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:24,219
Noah she liked and so it would get one

356
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:27,369
of her long knitting needles I get one

357
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:30,040
of these stems and I punch through all

358
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:32,078
of the nodal diaphragm measure the been

359
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:34,198
strength and the twisting strength and

360
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:40,349
we compared that to a nun surgically

361
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:40,349
manipulated grass or a cuisine of Stefan

362
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,490
22.5% of the strength of those

363
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:49,958
structures were the result of the nodal

364
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:53,440
diagram another 17% is actually provided

365
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:55,869
by the sheath that surrounds the base of

366
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,350
the internodes it acts like a girdle and

367
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:02,350
it is therefore in the proper place to

368
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:07,179
absorb most of the strain energy along

369
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:09,220
the internode we also then went into a

370
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:12,220
whole field of engineering called

371
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,230
cellular solids as botanists you're all

372
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,328
used to cellular solids if you think

373
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,220
about parenchyma it's a cellular solid

374
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,899
you have a liquid phase that's the

375
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,759
cytoplasm and you have a solid phase

376
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,919
those are the cell walls and it turns

377
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,779
out that cellular solids have a number

378
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,390
of properties biomechanical properties

379
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:31,359
that are influenced by the pressure of

380
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,640
the fluid inside of the cellular

381
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,979
components now in engineering

382
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,290
styrofoam's are an example of a cellular

383
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:41,380
solid in which the fluid phase is a gas

384
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:44,200
okay in botany the fluid phase is a

385
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,780
liquid cytoplasm so we did some

386
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,600
simulations and we predicted the effect

387
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:51,819
of the thickness and the radius of the

388
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:55,359
cell walls in these cellular solids and

389
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:57,460
we submitted these two tests and lo and

390
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,939
behold a computer model could be

391
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:03,789
validated within a 5 percent error so we

392
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,470
were getting pretty happy with this kind

393
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:09,428
of work which is still being pursued

394
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:13,069
in my lab by the way these are ongoing

395
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:15,288
biomechanical questions aerodynamics of

396
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:18,138
pollination so now I'm switching topics

397
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:21,589
it's another example going back to my

398
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:23,959
graduate days I was taught these things

399
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:26,240
these are some of the oldest known seed

400
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,100
plants well these aren't I mean these

401
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,710
are my watercolors these are

402
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:33,250
reconstructions of what the ovules look

403
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,808
like they're upper Devonian lower

404
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,269
Mississippian and they go by horrendous

405
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:41,690
names that I had to memorize like so

406
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:43,220
pingas Toma Hudson had sown Ensis he not

407
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,919
only had to memorize it you had to be

408
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,980
able to spell it not anymore

409
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,960
because nobody really cares well I was

410
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,960
taught when I was a graduate student

411
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,179
here you see a novel that looks pretty

412
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,610
much like a modern-day one there's a

413
00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:00,139
micropyle there's the integrant but if

414
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:01,878
you look at some of these other little

415
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:03,859
critters and this is really a

416
00:19:01,878 --> 00:19:08,058
megasporangium surrounded by what looks

417
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:10,158
like a dead squid and we were told as a

418
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:12,950
graduate student as graduate students

419
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:15,019
that this evolved from an ancestor that

420
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,600
looked like that and that the

421
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:19,759
coalescence of these squid like

422
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:23,028
tentacles in their fusion towards the

423
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:27,038
tip was a consequence of natural

424
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:29,538
selection operating on protection from

425
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,970
herbivores from little manipulated

426
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:34,250
terrestrial arthropods okay that would

427
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,629
go in there and eat the little eggs in

428
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,069
the little magnet commune fight and I

429
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:39,648
thought that was a very cute story

430
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:41,869
except I also know that these things

431
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:43,428
were wind pollinated or at least I was

432
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:46,548
told that they were in colony there

433
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:49,570
wasn't around in the Devonian upper

434
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:53,538
Mississippian but not the Devonian so I

435
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:55,908
said self um yeah this might be

436
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:59,690
protection but what about the influence

437
00:19:55,909 --> 00:20:02,360
on pollen and so I built myself a wind

438
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:05,179
tunnel okay so there's the contraction

439
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:07,459
cone of the wind tunnel and the fan and

440
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:11,090
the regulator are all here and you might

441
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:14,028
wonder what that tube is this is the big

442
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:17,839
gadget that was really important um this

443
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:19,960
this was a but a bubble generator now

444
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:24,069
what do I mean by a bubble generator

445
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,440
it used a surfactant that to create

446
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:28,750
bubbles individual bubbles that were

447
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,910
filled with helium and you had a

448
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,890
centrifugal device over here that you

449
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:35,110
could actually select the size of the

450
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,700
bubbles that you wanted and the size of

451
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:39,099
the bubbles that I wanted were bubbles

452
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:42,420
that were neutrally buoyant in other

453
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:45,429
words the weight of the little soap

454
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,230
downward was counteracted by the lifting

455
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,650
force of the helium so you could

456
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:55,029
actually see a bubble hover in

457
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:57,940
motionless air and not move so then you

458
00:20:55,029 --> 00:21:00,039
shine a big bright light on them okay

459
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,890
and what you're seeing now are these

460
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:05,109
little bubbles moving around a cylinder

461
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,750
you're looking down on the cylinder you

462
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:09,369
see the leeward sound side and you see

463
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,859
the turbulence that generally is

464
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:14,049
generated on the downwind side so now we

465
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:16,750
had a way of visualizing airflow

466
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:18,279
patterns and we needed to photograph

467
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,869
them and we needed to know what they

468
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:22,410
were doing from the top and the bottom

469
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:24,939
to get a construct for three-dimensional

470
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:26,920
airflow patterns around these structures

471
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,590
and here are some of the pictures

472
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:34,450
pictures I built little scale models

473
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:36,819
using clay and there you see in each

474
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,860
case the airflow is coming from the left

475
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:42,159
to the right and you see an impact

476
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:44,259
shion's own any music particles which is

477
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,390
hitting the surface but notice there was

478
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:48,190
a stagnant area where turbulence was

479
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,230
being generated so he got a little bit

480
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:53,680
excited about this and we did a long

481
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,980
many series of simulations and we looked

482
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:59,580
at the airflow patterns that

483
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,500
statistically most dominant airflow

484
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:05,679
especially around the receptive parts of

485
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:08,619
these structures to see whether or not

486
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,990
there was a bias that might carry pollen

487
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:13,929
towards the micropyle or the micropyle

488
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:16,150
like structure then we got really fancy

489
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,160
and we made what we called pseudo pollen

490
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,340
we could construct little things that

491
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,500
were like pollen only they were bigger

492
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:25,539
so he could see them and we coated the

493
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,069
surface with sticky stuff and then we

494
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:29,289
put them in a wind tunnel and we would

495
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:31,509
see happily would they come near the

496
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:33,369
micropyle well this was interesting but

497
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:33,589
it was not all that exciting because it

498
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:36,319
was

499
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:38,689
not conclusive so then I built small

500
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,059
little models and used like a podium

501
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:44,450
spores to see what would happen and what

502
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:47,779
we found was that the structure that

503
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:50,029
looks more most like modern-day ovules

504
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:53,539
actually was the most efficient at

505
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:57,200
capturing pollen around the micro polar

506
00:22:53,539 --> 00:23:00,230
lip and this was just a statistical

507
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,210
study in which we looked at the maximum

508
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:05,029
pollen that were actually towards the

509
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:08,269
micropyle critical wind speeds and we

510
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:10,430
found that the structures that look like

511
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:13,490
modern-day ovules were the most

512
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:16,310
efficient at the lowest wind speeds so

513
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,769
this was kind of nice and at least it

514
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:22,299
suggested that maybe the evolution of

515
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:25,190
the integument might have been under two

516
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:27,889
pressures from natural selection one is

517
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:31,490
protection and one is for capturing wind

518
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,930
pollen well I got excited about this and

519
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,920
I thought well why do I have to work

520
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,840
with dead things

521
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,789
I can work with living things there are

522
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,639
a lot of wind pollinated things like

523
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:42,319
pine and grasses not all grasses are

524
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,330
wind pollinated I think there's one that

525
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,279
grows in the tropics described by baauer

526
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:47,599
that's actually insect pollinated can't

527
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:50,119
remember the name but they see Jerry

528
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:53,240
Davis going like this rather than that's

529
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:54,919
so apparently I'm okay so we started

530
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,779
working with pinecones and we got a

531
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,820
little photography got a little bit

532
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:02,299
better that we could actually look at

533
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:04,189
very small scale of turbulence patterns

534
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:06,619
and what we found here was that there

535
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:10,340
were three things that a populate

536
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:13,849
pinecone does one is it produces

537
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:16,609
cyclonic vortices that wrap around the

538
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:20,149
ortho stickies and porosity keys of the

539
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:22,849
scale of you Liveris brac complexes

540
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:25,250
there were also little doldrums between

541
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:29,509
the axis of the cone and each of these

542
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:32,809
reproductive entities and then there was

543
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:35,450
back slip kind of turbulence and flow so

544
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:39,319
we got excited about this and we pursued

545
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:42,740
it and the next big invention was a

546
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:46,059
stroboscope stroboscopic light lighting

547
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:49,710
so now we broke those streamlines into

548
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:52,000
fragments and you see that successive

549
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:55,509
images of my bubbles

550
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,859
okay what's nice about this is since I

551
00:24:55,509 --> 00:25:00,609
know the rate at which the light is

552
00:24:56,859 --> 00:25:03,729
flashing I can measure the rate of

553
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:06,849
movement okay so now I could not just

554
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:10,029
look at patterns of airflow I could look

555
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:11,980
at distributions of local velocities

556
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:14,980
which from an aerodynamic point of view

557
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,029
is much more impressive now I just want

558
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,190
to point out what that when you're

559
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:20,109
dealing with fluid mechanics you have

560
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,029
two ways in which you can analyze it

561
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:23,500
when it's coiled and the oil Irian

562
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:26,139
approach and the other is called the

563
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,480
Lagrangian approach what's an oily Rhian

564
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:32,230
approach it's as if you were scaring out

565
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,370
a window and looking at everything that

566
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:38,079
came by that little piece of space okay

567
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:40,719
that's the oil Irian approach the other

568
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:45,189
is Lagrangian and that is you actually

569
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,950
follow what a particle is doing along

570
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:50,019
its trajectory and we had to do both to

571
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:53,700
really get an understanding of what was

572
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:56,559
going on oh this is the oil Irian

573
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,529
diagnosis of an ovulate cone this

574
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,750
velocity in meters per second and so you

575
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:03,549
just look at a little bit of space and

576
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,200
you look at all the pollen grains or all

577
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,180
the bubbles that are passing through

578
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,000
that space and you begin to quantify

579
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,580
what its material what it's a fluid

580
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,150
mechanical behavior is and what we found

581
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:17,710
was yes there was inertial impaction in

582
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,840
other words pollen grains would just hit

583
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:22,660
the cone but what was happening is that

584
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:25,720
the airflow patterns created by the

585
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:28,240
ovulate cone itself biased the

586
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,740
sedimentation of the pollen grains on

587
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,269
the upper surface of the ovulate bracht

588
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:37,509
complexes so this was actually a very

589
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:40,420
sophisticated device in the sense it's a

590
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:42,970
turbine but it's not rotating around its

591
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:45,850
axis it's causing the air to rotate

592
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:47,829
around its axis and it's biasing the

593
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:51,159
distribution of those air flow patterns

594
00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:54,159
to get pollen towards where the ovules

595
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,730
are which are in the ad axial surface of

596
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,700
the black complex

597
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:02,750
well we didn't want to just use models

598
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:06,600
so this is a real oops this is a real

599
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:09,720
pinecone this is real pine pollen these

600
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:11,519
are photographs of the worst of our

601
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,950
experiments because you know there's

602
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:17,519
just a cloud here you might see little

603
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:18,509
dots but nothing conclusive so we refine

604
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,480
the technique

605
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:24,990
refine the technique using stroboscopic

606
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,450
lighting and just to blow this little

607
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:30,930
piece up here these now are the

608
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:35,400
successive locations of a single pollen

609
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:38,039
drink you digitize this you computerized

610
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,830
this stuff and again you crank out the

611
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:43,799
numbers and you get the Lagrangian

612
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:46,829
approach so we're looking at individual

613
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:51,029
pollen grains moving around a real

614
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:53,970
ovulate cone what we found out was

615
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:56,759
rather surprising because when you

616
00:27:53,970 --> 00:28:01,380
actually look at the number of pollen

617
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:06,119
grains that are hitting the ovules of

618
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:09,420
different species of pine okay so here

619
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:11,759
are the ovulate cones here are the

620
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:15,420
pollen grains from those ovulate cones

621
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:19,289
and what you see is the pollen that is

622
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:24,269
most successful comes from the species

623
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:28,170
of the cone to which it belongs so there

624
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:30,900
is selective filtration lotta noise a

625
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:34,950
lot of randomness but wind pollination

626
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:38,490
in this case is not random it has a very

627
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:40,830
deterministic component okay then we got

628
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,529
into computer simulations real computer

629
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:45,199
simulations these are artificial pollen

630
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:48,869
grains we were looking at what are the

631
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,029
dimensions and densities of pollen that

632
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:53,250
are the optimal for different kinds of

633
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:55,649
plants this is ephedra these are the

634
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,650
ovules of the fedra those are the little

635
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,509
pollination droplets we had a lot of fun

636
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,980
I don't have time to get into all of

637
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:05,700
these stories but I can lend you

638
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:09,509
reprints grasses okay we did the same

639
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,410
thing with grasses using real pollen

640
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:12,900
from the

641
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:15,840
and we digitized them and we looked at

642
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,600
the aerodynamics around them and what we

643
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,069
found we were looking here at - let me

644
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:24,029
just go back we're looking at two

645
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:27,359
different species one is site area

646
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:30,539
Janicki alotta shown here it has a very

647
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,459
compact panicle okay the florets flowers

648
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:36,659
are are very close together something

649
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:39,259
like a pinecone in overall appearance we

650
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:42,240
also looked at this this is a gracias

651
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:44,369
high mollis which has a very loose

652
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,009
panicle you see little clusters of

653
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:50,069
flowers but on their individual stems

654
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:53,879
and the fluid mechanics around these two

655
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:56,399
dense panicle loose panicle very very

656
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:00,240
different okay as you might expect but

657
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:03,060
the other thing is we noticed that the

658
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,029
loose panicle was a natural harmonic

659
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:09,269
oscillator each of these little clusters

660
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:10,889
of flowers on the stems of different

661
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:12,900
lengths different stiffness they were

662
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:17,400
oscillating in different directions and

663
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:20,070
at different speeds whereas the satalia

664
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:23,580
Kanaka was oscillating in a very

665
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:26,129
predictable natural harmonic we could

666
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:30,929
actually measure the harmonic frequency

667
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:33,030
of these things using a biaxial trend

668
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:35,460
optical transducer that could actually

669
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:37,349
track the motion of this thing in all

670
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,450
directions and then you could put it

671
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:41,699
through a Fournier analysis and you

672
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,860
would get the natural harmonic the

673
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,890
second harmonic the third harmonic and

674
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:48,929
it turns out let me go back turns out

675
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,970
that you could actually not only talk

676
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,830
about the aerodynamics but we now could

677
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:55,019
talk about the material properties of

678
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:57,659
the stem because the natural frequency

679
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:00,839
is related to the stiffness of the

680
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:03,300
material to young's modulus and this

681
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,669
goddess interested in solid mechanics

682
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:07,409
and the interface between solid and

683
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:10,259
fluid mechanics again i'm just giving

684
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:12,210
these as samples i don't have time to go

685
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:14,009
into all the detail besides which

686
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:18,720
they're excruciatingly ly boring and

687
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:21,480
they're published okay so what else do

688
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,900
you do well again it's Adrienne

689
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,360
and I was undergraduate in major in

690
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:31,080
mathematics I was always fascinated by

691
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:34,259
the symmetry of plants I mean you look

692
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:36,389
at a plant and you just say it's

693
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:38,730
beautiful but it's beautiful because in

694
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,530
part of its symmetry and so I got

695
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,990
interested in fellow taxi the

696
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:45,859
arrangements of believes and just to

697
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:50,490
give you a few examples distich --is

698
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:54,209
example in libya opposite dicus aid in

699
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:57,150
some kind of MIT spiral arrangement etc

700
00:31:54,210 --> 00:32:01,558
there all these beautiful symmetries

701
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:05,160
that seem to conform to what is called a

702
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:08,009
Fibonacci series helios d Bonacci the

703
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:11,070
son of Bonacci named contracted to

704
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:12,660
fibonacci okay but it's fili estheban

705
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:14,939
aki anyway

706
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:17,850
what he did is you know he created these

707
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:22,289
wonderful mathematical kind of series

708
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:24,779
you add up the numbers and you get the

709
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:26,428
next number then you add up the previous

710
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:28,019
number to that number and you get the

711
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:29,910
next number the next number the next

712
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:32,668
number and you can start with any number

713
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:35,490
but you just use this a mathematical

714
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:38,370
series and if you make fractions of them

715
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:41,009
like here and you keep increasing the

716
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:43,199
numbers they converge on the golden mean

717
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:47,099
you can convert these fractions into

718
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:52,860
angles and so the series will always

719
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:55,319
approach expressed in in angles 137.5 or

720
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:58,048
there abouts okay and this excited

721
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:00,629
mathematicians in botanist for hundreds

722
00:32:58,048 --> 00:33:02,910
of years basically because the Golden

723
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:05,130
Rule now that plants have learned the

724
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:07,650
Golden Rule this is why they arrange

725
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:12,900
their leaves the way they do well it's

726
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:15,750
not true okay and a long time ago we

727
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:18,330
created a little mathematical model for

728
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:21,859
the arrangements of leaves on a single

729
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:25,349
stem and you need only a few parameters

730
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:28,109
you need the deflection angle of the

731
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:30,089
leaf you need the rotation angle of the

732
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:31,529
leaf you need the distance between

733
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:34,500
successive leaves

734
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:37,049
you need the divergence angle that's

735
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,000
Fibonacci series and then you can play

736
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:41,579
around with the leaf the length of the

737
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,039
petiole the width and the length of the

738
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:47,609
petiole we kept things simple all leaves

739
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:50,789
are of you are either ellipses or

740
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:53,429
circles no lo being nothing just to see

741
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:56,009
what would happen and you can create all

742
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:59,160
of these different pillow tactic

743
00:33:56,009 --> 00:34:02,269
patterns here now you're looking down on

744
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:05,250
a kind of rosette can put these

745
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:08,039
mathematically into a computer and say

746
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:11,460
okay the Sun is going overhead from dawn

747
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:14,099
to dusk how much energy do these leaves

748
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,530
collectively absorb what is their

749
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:19,679
efficiency at trapping light and now you

750
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:21,980
have Morpho spaces what is some MorphOS

751
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,570
space well in this case we have the

752
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:27,960
Fibonacci angle the divergence angle

753
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:31,169
here we have the amount of energy a

754
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,869
plant can absorb and by the way this is

755
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:36,210
the angle and that's the actual fraction

756
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:38,429
so they're really the same axes and

757
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:42,628
wherever you see this big broad line

758
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:45,440
here that's the golden mean 130 7.5 and

759
00:34:42,628 --> 00:34:48,210
you can see 4 little stubby rosettes or

760
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:52,619
rosettes with what looked like pizza

761
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:55,789
kind of shovels or 4 round leaves that

762
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:59,429
really the optimal is the Fibonacci

763
00:34:55,789 --> 00:35:00,989
convergent series 130 7.5 but the minute

764
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:04,289
you start playing with internodal

765
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:06,750
distances for example or our patio

766
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:08,699
lengths things of that sort the

767
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,280
difference between all of these fibbin

768
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:14,460
of all of these divergence angles of

769
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,940
leaf arrangement are washed out the one

770
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,550
is no better than the other ok so the

771
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,340
only time that the golden mean seems to

772
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,080
work is if you're a cabbage if you're a

773
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,640
rosette where all the leaves are

774
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,500
basically shading each other

775
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,599
the minute you start elongating or

776
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,909
changing the geometry of the patio or

777
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,339
change the deflection angles of those

778
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:37,049
leaves it doesn't matter how you arrange

779
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:39,240
it which is really good for clivia

780
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:41,820
because the leaves are in two different

781
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:44,250
rows and it doesn't seem to bother it we

782
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:47,220
also could simulate the effect of

783
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,389
latitude and things of that sort and if

784
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:50,818
you play with loud

785
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:53,278
all of those leaf arrangements can be

786
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:57,568
equally efficient it really doesn't

787
00:35:53,278 --> 00:36:02,548
matter okay I got two more to go and I'm

788
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:07,619
gonna go through it I hope in time but

789
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:09,869
this is okay so early land plant

790
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:12,059
evolution well when I was taught

791
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:13,619
paleo botany we were all excited about

792
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:16,259
the Devonian because that's when

793
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:18,539
everything seemed to happen okay my

794
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:20,789
professors were excited I was excited

795
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:22,710
but when you look at the plants from the

796
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:25,528
Devonian they're actually excruciatingly

797
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:27,749
lis boring right I mean really a few

798
00:36:25,528 --> 00:36:31,980
where taxonomy today you might classify

799
00:36:27,748 --> 00:36:34,469
all of these things into one family or

800
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,619
one something or another and just give

801
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:42,808
them different generic and species names

802
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:46,160
binomials but the beauty of these plants

803
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:49,710
is that they're botanical tuning forks I

804
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:53,818
can mathematically describe their

805
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:57,210
geometry with only a few variables okay

806
00:36:53,818 --> 00:36:59,869
I need to know again the bifurcation

807
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:02,909
angle what is the angle between

808
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:06,559
bifurcations what is the rotation angle

809
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:09,389
and what is the probability of branching

810
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,849
other things that I can include our

811
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:16,338
diameter and length of these elements

812
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:20,489
and I can create a universe of all

813
00:37:16,338 --> 00:37:23,548
mathematically possible structures in a

814
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:28,159
fairly simple Cartesian coordinate

815
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:31,440
system this is a simple morphic space

816
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:33,298
you can go n dimensional you don't have

817
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,220
to be three-dimensional right I mean

818
00:37:33,298 --> 00:37:38,009
they card there's that little thing you

819
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:40,588
have X Y Z you know it's coordinates can

820
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:42,480
I add other dimensions in other words

821
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:44,548
other parameters to describe the

822
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,179
morphology well of course I can I can

823
00:37:44,548 --> 00:37:49,409
add more axes and forget about being

824
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:51,750
three-dimensional

825
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:54,659
the other way to deal with this almost

826
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:57,300
an infinite number of axes is you line

827
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:59,369
them up like this and this point in that

828
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,080
point in that point at that point in

829
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:04,559
this point in that point are all the

830
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:08,130
same points one point that's an object

831
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:10,049
in n-dimensional space so don't let

832
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:12,090
anybody tell you that you can't plot

833
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,800
more than three dimensions you can't

834
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:17,480
it's easy okay

835
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:21,170
computers can handle this I can't okay

836
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:25,050
there is slices through the Morpho space

837
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:28,200
that just took three slices so you get

838
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:30,720
things like siloed um you get things

839
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:33,359
that look like real trees you get things

840
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,250
that yeah sort of look like conifers and

841
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,970
then you get to things that look like a

842
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:41,760
mess okay and years ago I gave this talk

843
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:43,500
in New Zealand and I said well there's

844
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,540
nothing really like that and they all

845
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,489
started laughing and they said you

846
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:50,190
haven't seen our dive arrogating shrubs

847
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:52,769
have you and I said no and they said

848
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:54,630
well there are stems that grow inward

849
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:59,070
not outward and I said well that's them

850
00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:00,390
over there so you know so okay so now I

851
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,010
have this more foot space what am I

852
00:39:00,389 --> 00:39:03,989
going to do with it well it turns out

853
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,540
that I can quantify the performance of

854
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:09,029
those morphologies in the Morpho space

855
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:11,820
okay I can actually calculate their

856
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:14,280
ability to intercept light to conduct

857
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,680
fluids to reproduce and to provide

858
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,470
mechanical support I've written books

859
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:22,980
about how to do this okay so I this is

860
00:39:19,469 --> 00:39:24,689
my gross self advertisement and I can

861
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,449
give you free copies nobody buys them

862
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:30,090
anyway I could have made a fortune with

863
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:33,329
this it is the best cure for insomnia

864
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:36,710
that I know of I can't even read more

865
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:39,199
than three pages and none stay awake

866
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:41,030
so yeah just to give you a nice oh you

867
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,939
move the Sun over something like this

868
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:45,980
and you calculated self-shading etc you

869
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,500
can look at mechanical stability what

870
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,780
are the moment arms the influence of

871
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,760
gravity I can look at the probability of

872
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:56,480
discharging spores in the distance those

873
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:59,660
sports travel etcetera etc so now now I

874
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,490
can quantify the performance of each of

875
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:03,558
those objects in the Morpho space and

876
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:07,358
what i can do is i could simulate an

877
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:08,510
adaptive walk okay I can start someplace

878
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,568
here

879
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:13,670
maybe the earliest known vascular land

880
00:40:11,568 --> 00:40:15,980
plant and I can look around in that

881
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,720
Morpho space next to it and say is there

882
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,179
anything that's just as good or better

883
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:22,969
and so the computer finds that

884
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:25,838
morphology and it keeps doing this until

885
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:28,338
it gets to a morphology that is

886
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,380
surrounded by nothing that's better or

887
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:33,440
as good okay

888
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:36,829
it's an adaptive peek we had to test it

889
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,818
we had to know does this really work so

890
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:43,280
it turns out that this is salla cornea

891
00:40:39,818 --> 00:40:45,529
Europa it's a little hallow fight it

892
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,839
looks like one of these boring Devonian

893
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:50,869
plants but it's actually an angiosperm

894
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:53,029
but it had a trifurcation kind of

895
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:54,740
branching pattern and what we found was

896
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:57,140
the geometry of this plant changes

897
00:40:54,739 --> 00:41:00,379
dramatically depending upon the density

898
00:40:57,139 --> 00:41:02,779
of plants how closely they grow so we

899
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:06,079
simulated densities effect on the

900
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:08,510
ability to intercept light okay and we

901
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,030
compared the morphology of the plants at

902
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:13,339
different plant densities to the

903
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:16,298
morphology that the computer predicted

904
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:19,548
and lo and behold we were right

905
00:41:16,298 --> 00:41:23,690
computers are wonderful things until

906
00:41:19,548 --> 00:41:26,210
they failure so we said okay let's look

907
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:28,400
at the Devonian plants for different

908
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:30,230
functions and the first thing we tested

909
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,710
is light interception and mechanical

910
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:36,079
stability can you do them simultaneously

911
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:37,369
what happens okay there's a conflict by

912
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,200
the way because if you want to be

913
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:41,329
mechanically stable you want to be

914
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,129
vertical if you want to maximize light

915
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:45,079
interception you want to lie on your

916
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,869
side so they're the opposite of each

917
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:50,050
other you have to optimize not maximize

918
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:52,120
and so we started with Kooks

919
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:54,820
this is the earliest known vascular

920
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:56,529
plant fossil we found its location in

921
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,510
the Morpho space that's what the

922
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:02,010
computer says cooksonia looks like and

923
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:05,680
now we go through the adaptive walk and

924
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:08,200
we ended with that so just to very

925
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:11,230
quickly show you what was happening is

926
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:14,109
that the computer was predicting with

927
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:17,050
successive events to go from something

928
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:20,170
like a rainy out like plant with equal

929
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:23,050
branching to unequal branching to

930
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:25,090
overtopping to then lateral branches

931
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:27,130
that started to play mate and that

932
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:29,019
looked something like this and what was

933
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:32,369
really curious is that that's exactly

934
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:35,500
what the t loam theory predicts by

935
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:37,269
zimmerman this is how you get mega tilts

936
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,949
okay at least that's what he thought

937
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:41,170
well the computer said yeah dr.

938
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:43,210
Zimmerman you seem to be right the only

939
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:47,860
problem with something like this it's an

940
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:50,500
opaque model it may not be right it's

941
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:53,590
just telling you what the basis is of

942
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:56,139
your assumptions so by the way only two

943
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,030
functions right mechanics and light what

944
00:42:56,139 --> 00:43:00,519
happens if you just want to maximize

945
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:03,550
each performance what happens if you put

946
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:06,340
these in pairs or triplets or what

947
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:07,720
happens when you say do them all okay so

948
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,910
when I'm not going to show you walks I'm

949
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:11,829
going to show you the end result this is

950
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:14,739
what happens when you have single

951
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:17,739
functions maximizing reproduction

952
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:20,259
conservation of surface area maximizing

953
00:43:17,739 --> 00:43:22,539
mechanical stability light interception

954
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:25,240
now what happens when you do two

955
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:27,190
functions I won't read off all of these

956
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:29,319
but you'll notice things are looking a

957
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,300
little bit more complicated what happens

958
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,220
if you have three functions things are

959
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:36,519
getting much more complicated what if

960
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:39,779
you do all four those are all equal in

961
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:39,780
their performance

962
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:48,680
so many ways to make everything work

963
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:51,679
kind of fun because what it's saying is

964
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:54,409
if I'm a single function like a machine

965
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,548
I can maximize the performance my

966
00:43:54,409 --> 00:44:01,190
fitness but if I keep adding functions

967
00:43:57,548 --> 00:44:03,920
the number of tests entries so did the

968
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:07,130
number of equally efficient phenotypes

969
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,409
but their global fitness is down this

970
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:11,630
kind of explains why when you dive into

971
00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:15,558
the desert all the desert plants don't

972
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:18,289
look the same okay not all trees look

973
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:21,380
the same they're equally good a long

974
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:23,089
time to talk about this but imagine if

975
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:27,588
you're an engineer and I say design a

976
00:44:23,088 --> 00:44:32,480
toaster I'm gonna be really good now how

977
00:44:27,588 --> 00:44:35,900
about a toaster and a hairdryer okay

978
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,639
so I'm not gonna go on to this I'm going

979
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,769
to end with this so that you can all

980
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:43,038
have lunch last thing I want to talk

981
00:44:39,768 --> 00:44:45,108
about is forest dynamics so real for

982
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,240
it's very complicated but it turns out

983
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:50,298
that if you go into the data and you

984
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:52,429
start looking at trends within sizes and

985
00:44:50,298 --> 00:44:54,588
girths of trees in a variety of

986
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:57,108
different force you find very strict

987
00:44:54,588 --> 00:44:59,599
allometric relationships this one is the

988
00:44:57,108 --> 00:45:01,518
log of standing leaf mass versus the log

989
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,818
of standing stem mass and you can see

990
00:45:01,518 --> 00:45:07,848
that's a log log linear regression over

991
00:45:04,818 --> 00:45:10,969
many orders of magnitude from forests as

992
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:12,980
different as conifers and mixed

993
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:16,189
deciduous forests so there are rules

994
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:20,028
somehow question is what are they so

995
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:22,250
Shawn Hammond of one of my graduate

996
00:45:20,028 --> 00:45:25,039
students many years ago had a knack for

997
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:27,469
computer simulations and I said Shawn

998
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:29,240
how about modeling forests and he looked

999
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:34,518
at me and he said we'll be that get me a

1000
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:39,348
PhD and I said yes so so he said ok so

1001
00:45:34,518 --> 00:45:41,298
we started looking at rules and one of

1002
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:43,430
them was given to us by this gentleman

1003
00:45:41,298 --> 00:45:46,849
many hundreds of years ago

1004
00:45:43,429 --> 00:45:51,509
this is Apollonius of Tyana I remember I

1005
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:57,510
remember his theorems from when I took

1006
00:45:51,510 --> 00:46:02,160
geometry complex geometry yes well he

1007
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:04,530
was he was a little younger then but he

1008
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,139
was interested in how do you package

1009
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:09,480
things together for example how many

1010
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:12,000
circles can I get into this kind of

1011
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,130
geometry notice this is the arc of a

1012
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,969
circle that's the arc of a circle that's

1013
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:19,260
the arc of a circle and so he had some

1014
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:21,899
mathematics that we began to play with

1015
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:24,300
and we started introducing those rules

1016
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,300
into the computer simulations but

1017
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,930
another problem that we had was how much

1018
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:33,840
do I give to make new leaves to make new

1019
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:36,629
roots and new stems this is a banking

1020
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,640
problem you get so much energy in a year

1021
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,470
and you have to produce leaves you have

1022
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,599
to produce stems you have to produce

1023
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:45,299
roots and if you produce too many leaves

1024
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:48,119
with respect to the stem you can fall

1025
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:50,490
over if I produce too few roots with

1026
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:54,269
respect to stems I can fall over so this

1027
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:57,239
is the classic allocation of biomass not

1028
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:59,579
money and we had a beautiful algorithm

1029
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:02,039
starting with a little seedling energy

1030
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:04,259
for growth reproductively mature yes no

1031
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:06,360
energy for reproduction violate a

1032
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:11,870
physical law no two objects can occupy

1033
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:14,340
the same space you die okay so okay so

1034
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:16,739
here at the beginning of our simulations

1035
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,780
and we were going low density and then

1036
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:21,000
watching them grow higher density higher

1037
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,070
density higher density and now for all

1038
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,250
of this trauma I want to show you a

1039
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:27,809
movie but first of all I need my classes

1040
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:30,170
because I have to press a button and I

1041
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:32,610
can't find it not to worry

1042
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:37,829
there we go okay so what you're looking

1043
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:40,019
at now is a single propagule that is

1044
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:42,480
reproducing you're looking at it from

1045
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:45,000
this side and looking down we see that's

1046
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,480
a single seed and every iteration was

1047
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,159
one year okay so now that was one

1048
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,710
propagule I want to show you what you

1049
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:55,609
what happens when you randomly scatter

1050
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:55,610
those seeds

1051
00:47:56,889 --> 00:48:01,748
and this is going to go for over 600

1052
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:03,578
years those little specs you see those

1053
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:06,129
are the seats that are being released

1054
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:08,440
from the canopy later on you'll see some

1055
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:10,509
light gaps where an old tree dies and

1056
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:14,889
then you see some little puppies filling

1057
00:48:10,509 --> 00:48:16,748
in see that oh this is so cute you know

1058
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:17,980
you can watch it on Sunday when you're

1059
00:48:16,748 --> 00:48:21,909
bored and it's snowing

1060
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:25,150
that's almost every Sunday but how do

1061
00:48:21,909 --> 00:48:29,920
you test a model like this no am i doing

1062
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:32,079
why isn't it going oh wait now these

1063
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,608
darn computers I don't understand why

1064
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,380
they don't do what I tell them to do

1065
00:48:33,608 --> 00:48:38,348
well let's see if we can do it this way

1066
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:41,048
okay so how do you test a model what we

1067
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:43,900
looked around for forestry data and it

1068
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:48,400
was wonderful to find this publication

1069
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:52,269
from published in Italian University of

1070
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:56,528
Forenza Italy imagine they went out into

1071
00:48:52,268 --> 00:49:00,518
a new forest and measured properties for

1072
00:48:56,528 --> 00:49:02,528
80 years how many leaves

1073
00:49:00,518 --> 00:49:04,959
what's the girth of the stems what's the

1074
00:49:02,528 --> 00:49:07,599
height of the trees over 80 years the

1075
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,269
school of Forestry just had new people

1076
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:12,700
come in PhD students you might go out

1077
00:49:10,268 --> 00:49:14,858
there measure the force so we had data

1078
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:19,858
and what we could do is we could

1079
00:49:14,858 --> 00:49:24,759
parameterize our computer model for this

1080
00:49:19,858 --> 00:49:26,588
tree a bees album okay and now what I'm

1081
00:49:24,759 --> 00:49:31,298
going to show you our graphs that look

1082
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:34,599
like this one of these symbols is the

1083
00:49:31,298 --> 00:49:38,369
data and the other symbol is the

1084
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:38,369
prediction of the computer model

1085
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:50,039
nice nice but there's something else

1086
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:53,400
that came out that we never expected the

1087
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:56,610
computer model predicted how old the

1088
00:49:53,400 --> 00:50:04,380
trees were before they would produce

1089
00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:07,800
seed and that's what we found in the

1090
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:09,510
data set we had cross-validation in

1091
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,850
other words we had an emergent property

1092
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:14,070
that we never put into the program and

1093
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:16,639
the program made a prediction that we

1094
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:22,800
didn't expect what happened to be true

1095
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:30,150
so what have I learned from 45 years of

1096
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:32,130
modeling it's fun but I going to propose

1097
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:35,610
a few tools and then I'll be done

1098
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:38,610
how do you evaluate well you fit

1099
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:39,780
empirical data I just showed you and you

1100
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:42,030
use the technique called

1101
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:45,750
cross-validation you look for

1102
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:49,530
predictions that aren't in the algorithm

1103
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:52,619
that still comply with reality okay like

1104
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:55,410
we did with the ABS defining a model

1105
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:59,789
scope it's really important to know when

1106
00:50:55,409 --> 00:51:02,190
a model is in applicable what are the

1107
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:05,279
range of phenomena they handle you can

1108
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:08,190
interpolate but the danger is to

1109
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,530
extrapolate you can't go beyond the

1110
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:14,300
boundaries of your model unless you have

1111
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:17,190
data unless you have data to test it and

1112
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:20,010
last but not least the appearance of

1113
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:22,559
emergent properties the appearance of

1114
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:24,579
maturation that that last model

1115
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,139
predicted okay

1116
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:31,809
the fallacy of causality is always their

1117
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:35,318
correlation strong positive correlations

1118
00:51:31,809 --> 00:51:38,019
do not necessarily prove that you have

1119
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:44,278
cause and effect that's always a

1120
00:51:38,018 --> 00:51:44,278
temptation but you have to resist it so

1121
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,400
[Applause]

1122
00:51:57,748 --> 00:52:18,159
questions

1123
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:22,239
Peter so two factors a your leaves are

1124
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:24,578
not really ok can you mention that were

1125
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:35,588
you able to look at what would happen

1126
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:37,800
when light exceeds what belief means

1127
00:52:35,588 --> 00:52:41,519
so therefore

1128
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:43,710
but you got actually more efficient for

1129
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:47,159
the community which which illustrates

1130
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:49,530
what's happened to corn they not the

1131
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:51,929
yields like crazy by changing the leaf

1132
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:54,210
angles washing in many more plants

1133
00:52:51,929 --> 00:52:55,739
burrito no the both at both both of

1134
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:58,199
those questions are really good so to

1135
00:52:55,739 --> 00:53:00,269
answer the first one yes we can one of

1136
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:02,210
the parameters would be the opacity of

1137
00:53:00,269 --> 00:53:04,409
the leaf the transmission of

1138
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,699
photosynthetically useful radiation

1139
00:53:04,409 --> 00:53:07,710
because of course a lot of the light

1140
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:12,000
coming out of it is green and that's not

1141
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:14,340
particularly exciting yeah that to the

1142
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,030
question of leaf orientation when it

1143
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:20,400
comes to the canopies of trees the best

1144
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:23,070
assumption is that the leaf orientation

1145
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,510
is random because I have a leaf like

1146
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,950
this I have a leaf like this I have a

1147
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:28,230
leaf like this and if you have more than

1148
00:53:25,949 --> 00:53:29,759
a few leaves you can basically say you

1149
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:32,280
can either model it as a frequency

1150
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,910
distribution or you can just say it's

1151
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:38,580
all roundup okay and it turns out that

1152
00:53:35,909 --> 00:53:41,219
it doesn't really matter once you get to

1153
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:44,369
a certain size because you have so many

1154
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:47,009
lives right it doesn't have much effect

1155
00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:50,940
yep we looked at the phenomena like that

1156
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:56,450
and latitude now I never worked on corn

1157
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:56,450
it's way too boring no offense

1158
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:01,610
what we find

1159
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:05,980
thank you very much

1160
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:18,079
both questions do biology hosta model it

1161
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:20,870
depends on your discipline I mean if I

1162
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:24,019
was into metabolomic side be looking at

1163
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:25,519
metabolic systems if I was into genetics

1164
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:28,190
and development it would be gene

1165
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:30,440
regulatory networks if I was into

1166
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:32,929
ecology it would be community dynamics

1167
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:37,970
all of those are amenable to modeling

1168
00:54:32,929 --> 00:54:39,949
okay so the model is a tool and the

1169
00:54:37,969 --> 00:54:43,009
important thing about a tool is you have

1170
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:45,199
to have an important question it's the

1171
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:48,050
question that drives the choice of tool

1172
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:53,319
not the tool that drives the selection

1173
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:53,320
of the question I'm kind of old school

1174
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,590
Brandi

1175
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,190
well

1176
00:55:02,389 --> 00:55:08,279
and what I think that with Shawn

1177
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:11,190
Hammonds computer modeling we saw so

1178
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,040
many emergent properties not just the

1179
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:16,769
onset of reproductivity and maturation

1180
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:19,500
but a lot of other phenomena that we

1181
00:55:16,769 --> 00:55:23,250
never expected a simple model to produce

1182
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:25,559
okay like density dependent depth okay

1183
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:28,858
which can be used to model the spread of

1184
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:30,809
pathogens so yeah there are a lot of

1185
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:41,219
applications not just to forested

1186
00:55:30,809 --> 00:55:42,989
communities so you've got the model of

1187
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:45,149
the forest community and then you also

1188
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:48,719
have the model of the forms of the plant

1189
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:50,070
so two questions from one cannot be

1190
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,019
combined together so that you could

1191
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:53,390
actually model the forest community not

1192
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:55,619
just looking like

1193
00:55:53,389 --> 00:55:57,799
plant but looking like multiple species

1194
00:55:55,619 --> 00:56:00,140
and how those giving

1195
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,460
can I answer that question for so if you

1196
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:03,980
haven't heard the question is can you

1197
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:07,220
use this kind of model not to look at

1198
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:08,500
mono specific stands but what happens

1199
00:56:07,219 --> 00:56:11,719
when you have different species

1200
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:13,960
interacting and in fact we did that we

1201
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:16,759
actually parameterised a number of

1202
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,500
different kinds of trees because we were

1203
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,720
looking at we were interested in

1204
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:24,079
competitive exclusion to one of these

1205
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:28,309
things muscled out the other in very few

1206
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:31,789
cases we found that coexistence was the

1207
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:34,639
rule what would happen however if you

1208
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:37,009
started with equal numbers of seeds that

1209
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:41,179
were randomly distributed you would see

1210
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:44,480
that some species would be repressed so

1211
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:46,969
their numbers would drop below 25% if

1212
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:50,719
you had four but then they would plateau

1213
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:53,358
and they would persist for as long as we

1214
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:56,899
ran the simulations and that's something

1215
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:59,059
that Shawn is actually following up on

1216
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:03,700
now that he's got a tenure-track

1217
00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:03,699
position so you had another question

1218
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:09,558
if you use sort of the history instead

1219
00:57:07,998 --> 00:57:10,818
of people to their potential forms that

1220
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,960
could be there they're restricted in

1221
00:57:10,818 --> 00:57:13,579
their history and their branching

1222
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,449
pattern and what they look like

1223
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:17,769
can you use it

1224
00:57:15,449 --> 00:57:19,989
yes you can't said the question is can

1225
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:20,980
you use the two last models that I

1226
00:57:19,989 --> 00:57:24,848
talked about where you had different

1227
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:27,940
forms can use them to fertilize

1228
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:30,730
fertilize one to another you can okay

1229
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:32,740
but when you start modeling something

1230
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:35,740
like that you have to make a large

1231
00:57:32,739 --> 00:57:39,219
number of assumptions and the results

1232
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:42,159
will be very dependent something again

1233
00:57:39,219 --> 00:57:44,980
the early evolution land plant model is

1234
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:46,899
an opaque model okay it may not tell us

1235
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:49,750
anything about reality but what it does

1236
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:53,440
do is it makes the logical consequences

1237
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:55,030
of our assumptions transparent I will

1238
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,599
tell you that those simulations were

1239
00:57:55,030 --> 00:58:01,720
done on Atari simulators Atari computers

1240
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:04,869
we had four Atari computers hooked up as

1241
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:14,139
a network and some of those simulations

1242
00:58:04,869 --> 00:58:16,809
took months and this took a lot of

1243
00:58:14,139 --> 00:58:20,139
brownej you would lose the results of

1244
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:24,309
those simulations so it was not easy now

1245
00:58:20,139 --> 00:58:27,429
we've got big computers okay what took

1246
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:29,828
us months maybe take a few hours I mean

1247
00:58:27,429 --> 00:58:31,690
those the polling that I did with finite

1248
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:35,619
elements with protists of India that was

1249
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:37,480
using Fortran Fortran you know stacks

1250
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:40,690
and stacks of what looked like postcards

1251
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:46,349
the little holes punch you drop and

1252
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:50,880
we're scarred all over again is that it

1253
00:58:46,349 --> 00:58:50,880
