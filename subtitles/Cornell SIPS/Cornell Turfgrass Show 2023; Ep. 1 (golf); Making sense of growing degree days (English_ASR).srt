25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,700
you all and uh just I'll second that

26
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,039
Carl

27
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,260
um this is really great because of the

28
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,539
people we get to share it with right and

29
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,358
now you got uh three Italian Guys so

30
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,299
with without for any further Ado without

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,400
any further to do let me get to it so as

32
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,100
Carl said we started this just howling

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,100
at the moon Carl and I I think uh during

34
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,899
the pandemic just to try to support uh

35
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,359
guys who didn't know if you could work

36
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,520
uh how could you work how many people

37
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,799
could work how many people in a truck

38
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,599
all the things that were involved in

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,479
getting things done

40
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,819
um and now it's really created a body of

41
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,700
content that someday somebody's going to

42
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:35,279
mine and they're going to say wow that

43
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,340
Rossi was stupid but scamenty man he

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,320
really had it going on so I like to pick

45
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,759
pictures I still do it we're very

46
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,039
fortunate that we share these things

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,259
collectively and for those of you listen

48
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,500
on the podcast I've got a slide that

49
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,840
basically shows uh uh people laying sod

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,700
around a bunker and a blizzard and I

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,700
think this is what caught us off guard a

52
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,240
little bit but really in in in honor of

53
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,759
having a uh a wannabe meteorologist with

54
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,938
us I thought that this particular uh

55
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,280
tweet was was really typified something

56
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:10,799
we've been talking about art for a

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,620
really long time and that is the damn

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,020
win so so I appreciated the way this

59
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,420
meteorologist uh presented this and for

60
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,920
those who don't know art is involved uh

61
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,799
here in the earth and Atmospheric

62
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,259
science department uh and has personally

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,840
trained a lot of people maybe even this

64
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:30,299
particular woman I I was thinking those

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,340
are bullets directly from my class on

66
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,840
the on the digatano wind speed scale

67
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,959
that's awesome

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,700
so great she could be a student and she

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,280
doesn't cite you but listen before we

70
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:43,500
get going with art and growing grass uh

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,598
I want to bring in my co-host Carl bring

72
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,280
you back and and also say what a joy

73
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,738
it's been working with you and

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,378
especially in your new role as the urban

75
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,780
environmental scientist right we're in

76
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:58,318
the process of uh hiring a new person

77
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,060
for the state park Agronomy job uh and

78
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,458
Golf Course ecosystem job and Carl

79
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,620
you've assumed this new role and we're

80
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,479
going to give you a chance to rant uh

81
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,219
potentially about one of the topics I've

82
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,139
been listening to you rant about for a

83
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,239
little while and the golf ball is

84
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,219
changing so Carl without any further Ado

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,239
it's all yours brother yeah thanks Frank

86
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,979
we're getting into some of these

87
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,719
segments now as we progress in some of

88
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,280
these Seasons I'm definitely going to

89
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,378
get to some of the things I'm interested

90
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,680
in my new job capacity ecosystem

91
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:28,018
Services the uh the value of turfrass

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,519
and urban Landscapes uh but but the

93
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,620
topical discussion for our golf show

94
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,239
this week really stems from uh the

95
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,180
recent announcement announcement from

96
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,099
the USGA RNA about a new golf ball so

97
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,860
they announced really their intent to

98
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:42,419
create this model local rule basically

99
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,400
they want to have a golf ball for only

100
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,500
Elite competitions we don't really know

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,120
what Elite competitions mean yet that's

102
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,000
going to go shorter somewhere between 15

103
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,099
and 20 yards shorter uh there's a lot of

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,539
Hammond and Han about if it's good for

105
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,459
the game bad for the game

106
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:59,459
and I really looked at the two arguments

107
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,439
that USG and RNA have made to

108
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,939
um sort of reason why this is something

109
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,459
they should do and the first argument

110
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,439
really has to do with uh the skill sets

111
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,000
of golfers Now versus back in the day

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,919
and how that shifted because of the

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
equipment and is that good or bad I

114
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,318
don't want to get into that today but

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,479
that's sort of their primary argument

116
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,000
the secondary argument is what I do want

117
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,379
to talk about today they say in in their

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,779
statement they said increased hitting

119
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,219
distances and course lengthening

120
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,079
threatens golf's long-term

121
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,800
sustainability Frank that's that's a

122
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:31,939
pretty uh interesting statement uh well

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,319
they've got in our lane Carl okay

124
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,459
and we've studied this so this is what I

125
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,860
want to get into the idea of

126
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,478
sustainability for most golf courses out

127
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,759
there the only version of sustainability

128
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,219
is is financial economic sustainability

129
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,319
are you making money and able to thrive

130
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,840
but again we got to go back to this is

131
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,819
competitive Elite competitions right so

132
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,978
when they talk about courses who are

133
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,500
affected by the new golf ball having to

134
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:58,560
change their Golf Course mayor Marion St

135
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,939
Andrews Augusta National Cypress Point I

136
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,100
got a picture up here for for those

137
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:04,259
watching of a new t-box Augusta just

138
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,240
made the 13th hole they made a new two

139
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:09,060
bucks there about 40 yards they added

140
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,000
they paid 30 million dollars for that 40

141
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,740
yards of course length that doesn't

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,540
sound to me Frank like of course that's

143
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,120
struggling financially already well I

144
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,600
wish I had that 40 yards of land I got

145
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,220
50. that much oh you're paying almost a

146
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,199
million dollars per yard to lengthen

147
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,460
that rule so economically that's that's

148
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,960
not what they're looking for here

149
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,939
they're talking about environmental

150
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,219
sustainability their argument is that

151
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,079
because courses have to lengthen they

152
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,940
then have to maintain more golf course

153
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,120
and that requires more resources more

154
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,800
inputs pesticides fertilizer water

155
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,300
greenhouse gases right we've studied

156
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,699
this Frank we've got two papers out now

157
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,280
looking at pesticide used and pesticide

158
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,800
risk on golf courses now we've looked at

159
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,599
it sort of internationally not even just

160
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,180
in the U.S and what our researchers

161
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,879
showed in all these cases is that the

162
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,939
Fairway resource use the pesticides we

163
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,038
apply to Fairway the same is true for

164
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:04,139
fertilizers irrigation the greenhouse

165
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:06,599
gases we spent Mowing and applying

166
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,280
cultural practices to these areas the

167
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,199
fairways are the primary driver of

168
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,119
resource Utah golf courses because

169
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,860
they're very big right we may not treat

170
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,560
them quite as intensely as the greens

171
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,080
but they make up such a larger area 25

172
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,699
30 35 acres and especially on

173
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,079
Championship courses which have high

174
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,000
expectations

175
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,339
so it'd be interesting for us to know

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,720
how have courses changed sort of how

177
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:29,339
they lay their course out have they

178
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,620
increased their Fairway acreage over the

179
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,779
years it turns out this has been studied

180
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,519
and it's been studied by the USGA and

181
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:38,159
the USGA green section did this a couple

182
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,818
years ago they mapped courses over time

183
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,860
using aerial images and GIS software uh

184
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,360
and and they used 80 random courses they

185
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,979
even had Championship courses in there

186
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,660
and they're finding was that

187
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:51,478
Championship courses had actually

188
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,180
decreased their Fairway acreage by six

189
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:57,000
acres from their Inception despite

190
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,379
adding 300 yards of length uh that's

191
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,639
actually the opposite of maybe what we

192
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:01,079
thought right they were saying one of

193
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,639
the usga's arguments in the statement

194
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,859
hey we're managing more land that's

195
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,600
unsustainable from this data we're

196
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,939
actually managing less of that land of

197
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,560
that Fairway land uh which is the most

198
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:12,779
resource use intensive as we know from

199
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,459
our work so if you get to my verdict

200
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,198
here is the golf ball affecting

201
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,579
sustainability of Championship nurses

202
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,740
I'm giving that a thumbs down Frank

203
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,359
that's not that's not what's affecting

204
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,579
the sustainability what I will say is

205
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,740
affecting the sustainability are these

206
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:27,959
other factors the player expectations

207
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,000
right green speeds this comes back too

208
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,918
and when you look at courses TPC

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,560
Sawgrass looked beautiful last week

210
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,418
played beautiful and it's super uniform

211
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,000
right and that requires a lot of

212
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:41,698
resources to maintain uniformity across

213
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,439
200 plus acres that's what the players

214
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,020
demand they they want every Fairway

215
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:49,500
every Green every bunker right all the

216
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:52,139
rough to react the same way across a a

217
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,939
changing landscape that's very resource

218
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,620
use intensive and when it doesn't happen

219
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:58,500
like Chambers Bay you can see a couple

220
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,939
tweets here of Pros uh getting up in

221
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,620
arms about that so if we're thinking

222
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:03,120
about environmental sustainability Frank

223
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,160
there's a lot of other factors I would

224
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,199
address well it's interesting Carl that

225
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,000
you know I love this and this is a wow

226
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,439
right this is a bit of a wow because

227
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,360
intuitively you think well if it's

228
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,279
longer it's got to be more land right

229
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,680
because length is going to give you land

230
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,779
and it's so fascinating that they by

231
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,660
their own measure they're not indicating

232
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:24,000
uh that that's the case but it is

233
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,879
rendering some of these Elite golf

234
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,439
courses irrelevant to the thing you

235
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,218
didn't answer the question there brother

236
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,038
I'm not letting you go should there be

237
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:37,080
two different types of balls

238
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,059
that that's a different question what I

239
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,740
wanted to answer was was why are they

240
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,079
doing this and I I'm not going to buy

241
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,519
the sustainability argument good if you

242
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,320
want to say hey we want to go to Cypress

243
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,299
Point and we want to stay at Pebble and

244
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,060
we don't want to change St Andrews

245
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:53,458
that's much more of sort of a uh you

246
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:55,739
know touchy feely conversation yeah yeah

247
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,299
that uh you know I I could either take

248
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,940
it or leave it I really don't care okay

249
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:02,639
so no verdict on bifurcation

250
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,160
uh it's I I don't buy the arguments

251
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,958
they're making there you go all right so

252
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,838
listen let's talk about Golf and a lot

253
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,299
more people are playing uh now that Jim

254
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,100
copenhaver and his pellucid group is

255
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:16,199
involved with National Golf Foundation

256
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,540
they got really good round numbers round

257
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,700
numbers are up dramatically from when we

258
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:22,559
started this show and we're holding on

259
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,620
to a lot of people that came back to the

260
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:28,018
game so for number one the thing to say

261
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,360
is at the end of 22 we had about 40

262
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:35,940
million more rounds about 12 percent

263
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,860
more rounds 13 more rounds uh in in 2022

264
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,339
than we did when we started the pandemic

265
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,360
what's fascinating is the weather sucks

266
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,660
art

267
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,180
the weather sucks right so look at this

268
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:50,819
data from from golf playable hours from

269
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:52,859
pellucid over a a long period of time

270
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,860
now golf playable hours as you got

271
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,720
enough light and Jim's uh Secret Sauce

272
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,700
says the weather factors are good for

273
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,519
golf right that you'll go out and play

274
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,860
golf so places like San Diego are pretty

275
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,159
much only well not this year but pretty

276
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,379
much only governed by how long the day

277
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,600
is because it's 70 and sunny every day

278
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:14,759
in San Diego for the most part so

279
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,100
obviously you'd imagine a high volume of

280
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,500
playable hours there and at the other

281
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,659
end a very low volume of playable hours

282
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,399
even here in central New York where we

283
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,799
thought we'd be playing already when you

284
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,200
look at the long the 10-year average we

285
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:31,620
have less time uh people for to play

286
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,500
golf and look at 2022 nationally it was

287
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:38,159
a big drop 10 12 percent more people

288
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,440
playing on less time to play so here's

289
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,360
another way that uh pelucid looks at it

290
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,640
this is playable hours year over year

291
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:50,700
here so compared to 20 uh one 22 had 20

292
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,319
percent less playable hours in the month

293
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,579
of November

294
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,920
but look at the utilization way off the

295
00:10:56,578 --> 00:11:02,879
charts seven percent up year over year

296
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:04,919
more golfers with less time are really

297
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,659
leading to concentrating traffic and

298
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:08,759
Carl has really pioneered a lot of

299
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:10,980
discussion on how we should be thinking

300
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,620
about traffic uh in the golf business

301
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,200
moving forward and using this pellucid

302
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,360
data to demonstrate to people hey this

303
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,160
is not only we got more people they're

304
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,860
playing in a compressed amount of time

305
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,500
in certain places now Art here's the

306
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,300
picture

307
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,100
is that from the school of the mines the

308
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:31,559
one on the left I think that's right

309
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,120
when I first got here on the left oh my

310
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,979
gosh so we've got here about the same

311
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,440
time art and I are in the same tenure

312
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,720
class not oddly enough so we share that

313
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,579
we met that President Jeff Lehman who

314
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,440
was here for five minutes that's

315
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:45,299
probably how we got this that's probably

316
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,160
how you and I got tenured the guy can't

317
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:49,078
believe he tenured us and then he left

318
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:50,759
he left holy crap and I have been at

319
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,859
this a while and you know we started

320
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:56,039
just doing conference calls and it led

321
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,980
to being able to use weather and climate

322
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:01,259
data to try to help turf grass managers

323
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,659
grow grass and we've been doing this a

324
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:05,338
long time I don't think people even paid

325
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:07,679
attention to it when we first started

326
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:10,200
doing it but it allowed us to begin to

327
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,719
collect data and look at Trends and we

328
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,879
published a paper in 07 basically

329
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,980
foretelling what we're experiencing

330
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,320
right now is that exactly we have more

331
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,860
consistent dollar spot pressure or and

332
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,680
been a big shift in many areas to the

333
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:28,379
fall as a heavier heavy period of time

334
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,479
so this was really appreciate at the

335
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,338
time to do it now here's I'm going to

336
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,959
try to set you up as best I can I got

337
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,600
winter with a question mark because it

338
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,219
looks like it just got here and it's

339
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,860
hopefully not going to stay very long

340
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,500
looking back at the December to February

341
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,600
time period right I love these ranking

342
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,700
systems you look at the northeast or

343
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,700
everything that's orange all right this

344
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,500
has got to be like top five ten percent

345
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,360
of the warmest Winters we've ever yeah

346
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,039
go ahead yeah I mean you do the math

347
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,620
there right that period of record starts

348
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:01,139
in 1895 so if you do the math those are

349
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,799
pretty much you know top one top two

350
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:08,278
actually in in in most cases okay so

351
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:10,439
then I was a little surprised by this

352
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,838
um because I was hearing about not as

353
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,240
much snow not as much rain but we here

354
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,760
in central New York you could you know

355
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,339
in central New York here oh sorry

356
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,200
there we go let me get the pen and of

357
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,180
course for those people uh listening on

358
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,980
the podcast you can't see it but I'm

359
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,379
circling the central New York where it

360
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,079
looks almost 200 percent above normal

361
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:32,939
but I go on Long Island where Beth Page

362
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:36,179
is and they tell me it's pretty dry down

363
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,740
there so it's on whole what would you

364
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:39,958
say about the moisture from the winter

365
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,519
yeah I think the the moisture from the

366
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,739
winter helped us out a lot if you can

367
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,899
remember back in the fall um you know

368
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,519
most places a lot of places in New York

369
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,019
and New England especially in

370
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,299
Massachusetts we're really talking about

371
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:54,179
drought there was a lot of drought uh as

372
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:55,439
we moved into the fall so really uh this

373
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,138
map and if you look at any of the

374
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,880
drought Maps really show that uh the the

375
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,079
winter pretty much took care of that

376
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,419
drought

377
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,638
um so we had adequate adequate or if not

378
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:07,919
above normal rainfall for most places

379
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,079
but not all places yeah that's true I

380
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,519
mean again New York and or Northern New

381
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,859
York and New England really good

382
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,419
rainfall Stream flow has jumped up

383
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,220
groundwater has jumped up so

384
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:19,620
everything's looking really optimistic

385
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,778
there but uh like you kind of point out

386
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,879
as you move further south things don't

387
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,620
look all that that good and you know on

388
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,899
this map even the further south you go

389
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,179
uh the worse it gets so there is still

390
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,799
some lingering dryness uh not quite

391
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:33,838
drought but but boy right on the

392
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,639
borderline there in Long Island and and

393
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,839
as you move into the New Jersey and

394
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,539
Philly area

395
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,000
temperatures been the story and it looks

396
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:44,458
like um eight to ten days we're going to

397
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,259
stall again you know we got this teaser

398
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:49,198
at the end of February this is off of

399
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:50,939
your uh drought page and it also looks

400
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,099
like we're going to be at least slightly

401
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,740
on the dry side for a lot of the

402
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,300
Northeast but it looks hard to predict I

403
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,278
know how you feel about anything more

404
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:02,159
than 48 hours what do you want to say

405
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,019
about predictions for the next 8-14 I

406
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,778
mean as I mean if you went through that

407
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:09,720
time series of my pictures uh my faith

408
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:12,838
in the 8 to 14 day forecast has has

409
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,060
really expanded a lot and you know I I

410
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,459
actually do put a lot more faith in

411
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:19,319
these uh in time and you know I think

412
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,539
what you're showing the next week here I

413
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,399
think this is going to be short-lived um

414
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:25,259
I mean we're gonna you know we're gonna

415
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,059
have a bit of a cool down

416
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,879
um you know today at least up here in

417
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:32,159
Ithaca it's supposed to almost crack 50

418
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:34,320
but then drop down a bit uh as we move

419
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,419
into the weekend and things like that so

420
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,699
I think this one week period here that

421
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,919
you're showing is is you know kind of a

422
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:43,799
I think you you said it well a pause

423
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,539
basically like a stall yeah the other

424
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:47,519
thing just looking at it I know the

425
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:50,219
forecast temperatures again for Upstate

426
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,620
in our area next week or or probably mid

427
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,740
40s and that sounds pretty good actually

428
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,839
so um but we're getting into that time

429
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,440
of year where yes it's below normal but

430
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,839
uh uh below normal is still uh you know

431
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,060
uh getting to be not too bad I guess

432
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,040
well and to your point thank you for

433
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:10,439
giving me a perfect transition

434
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,240
I stumbled across this data you know how

435
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,980
art we always talk about the length of

436
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,680
the growing season and how things have

437
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,839
changed over time and how climate change

438
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:22,138
is bringing the climates of New York

439
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,779
City the metro area maybe closer to the

440
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:27,120
Philly area on its way to the Baltimore

441
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:29,820
area right and we're seeing that with

442
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,360
warm season grasses slowly starting to

443
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:35,160
creep up and and frost-free days are an

444
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,379
indication of that so here's some data

445
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,958
from growing season link just looking at

446
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,820
that and you see a real shift in the

447
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:44,159
slope here art and it's the first time

448
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,680
I've ever seen people put actual days on

449
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:50,519
it you're looking at it skeptically you

450
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:52,859
know the 80 to 2000 period 12 days per

451
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:58,019
decade does that mean we've added almost

452
00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:00,360
a month in 30 in in in 40 Years of our

453
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:03,600
growth month yeah right 10 years a

454
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,039
decade so yeah almost almost a month

455
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,439
um I mean again

456
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,599
um you can take this graph in a number

457
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,419
of different ways ways I'd argue in a

458
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,279
lot of cases that 80 to

459
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,199
um you know to current period of time is

460
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,199
a bit of cherry picking because there is

461
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,179
a number of years there in the 80s and

462
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,459
uh what I really think is more dramatic

463
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:25,439
about this graph is you know when you go

464
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,600
to the 50s to the present right that's a

465
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,580
nice long period of time and you have a

466
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,139
nice consistent Trend there so I mean

467
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:32,819
you can play games with where you're

468
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,160
going to start things and you'll get get

469
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:37,500
a consistent Trend but yet that can

470
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,840
Trend that trend is consistently going

471
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,538
up well and boy aren't you the perfect

472
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,359
guest because the topic for today are is

473
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:47,160
Trends and you know we've Advanced some

474
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,099
of our understanding of Growing Degree

475
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Days in in many ways our use of them uh

476
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:55,038
base 50 base 32 but this was a year

477
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,740
where we really called into question

478
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:01,259
whether our March 15 start date that we

479
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,679
always used historically and honestly it

480
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:07,919
really comes as an artifact from the one

481
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:11,160
the weed control model that was for 24d

482
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,520
uh we don't use that date I think for

483
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:17,519
base 32 but maybe we do I don't know I

484
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:19,619
know our our models weren't up so here's

485
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,079
the question for today or I mean I'm

486
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:25,079
looking at I pulled this uh yesterday

487
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,538
this is the proxy seed head thing from

488
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,759
uh Michigan State and it's basically

489
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:31,819
saying that you know the Metropolitan

490
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,339
New York area Southeastern New England

491
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:37,200
all the way into central Pennsylvania

492
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:40,918
should be making their seed head

493
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,080
application so first off how do I want

494
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,940
to make a little more sense of Growing

495
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:46,619
Degree Days it's a goofy question when

496
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,259
is a growing degree day not a growing

497
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:50,159
degree day but my point is about the

498
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:53,579
stall

499
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,640
right we let's say we counted them since

500
00:18:53,579 --> 00:19:00,119
January and we had them that said we had

501
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,100
50 or whatever we had right for the last

502
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:05,639
month it's been sitting there

503
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:08,459
does that mean we start at zero or did

504
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,200
we get to capitalize on the 50. and this

505
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,019
is the question because we base

506
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,880
especially in the springtime a lot of

507
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:16,319
our models on this Growing Degree day

508
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,320
thing so I want to give you a chance to

509
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,759
sort of give us a you know a 101 if I

510
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:22,678
was sitting in your class on Growing

511
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,140
Degree Days and talk about some of the

512
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,059
sort of General issues we have and

513
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,538
things we still need to learn before we

514
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:32,460
can use these things discreetly right I

515
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:35,400
mean I think I'd start out with you know

516
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,220
a growing degree day has sort of you

517
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,019
know it they've been around for a long

518
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,660
time right and they're actually a pretty

519
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:44,339
simplistic measurement of really just uh

520
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,860
saying how far is the average

521
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:48,298
temperature of a day

522
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:50,759
um basically different from some

523
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:52,679
threshold that you know affects the

524
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,019
grass affects an insect uh you know

525
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,600
whatever right whatever it's calibrated

526
00:19:55,019 --> 00:20:00,298
to right it really needs calibration it

527
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,459
does and you know I think you know if

528
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:04,079
you've heard any of my my extension and

529
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,480
talks or anything like that one of the

530
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,279
things I rant about is really using the

531
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,140
calendar to make these decisions that

532
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,899
are that are weather related right we've

533
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,940
we've done that for for a long time you

534
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,160
know whether it's uh you know when we

535
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,840
chat with you it's like oh it's the you

536
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,820
know I'm gonna get the date wrong the

537
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,099
first you know the first week in May we

538
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:25,439
need to put down uh dandelion control or

539
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:27,298
something like that but in in some years

540
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,580
that might be prudent in other years it

541
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:30,660
might not be so so the weather is a key

542
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:32,519
there

543
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,200
um I think really going back to your

544
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:36,660
first question it's really that pause

545
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,580
and I think again climate change factors

546
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,340
into that you know we could be looking

547
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:44,099
at a period of time say in January where

548
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:45,720
we do you know over a week or two do

549
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:48,779
accumulate a substantial amount

550
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,419
particularly of Base 32 Degree Days but

551
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:53,460
then you know it it we we plunge into

552
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:56,038
the deep freeze you know the polar

553
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,740
vortex comes over us in the rest of

554
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,538
March and all of February are you know

555
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,700
pretty much we're not collecting

556
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:04,259
anything so you know my my question

557
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,179
there becomes maybe I'm going to throw

558
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:08,819
it back to you what would you say in

559
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:12,480
your biology class does the turf respond

560
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:15,000
to that kind of jolt in in uh in January

561
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,620
and you know when it when it comes out

562
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,380
of that deep freeze being covered in

563
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:21,119
snow does does it remember that thank

564
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,799
you for asking it because my answer

565
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,379
would be I think it would be set back

566
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,359
further if in fact those plants and it

567
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,520
some of it is not understood honestly

568
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,839
because it's probably a function of

569
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,599
light

570
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:36,599
um you know the ground sat bear when it

571
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,879
was warm the sun beat down we were

572
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:41,399
seeing soil temperatures are at two

573
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,520
inches into the mid 50s brother on Long

574
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,500
Island right so yeah my feeling is those

575
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:48,240
plants respond to that temperature I

576
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,038
don't know that we know about the

577
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,679
potential light impact because you still

578
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:55,798
are fairly shallow angle that you know

579
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:58,080
mid late February so so that the first

580
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:01,679
thing is I don't know but my concern is

581
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:04,798
we get going then this stuff comes and

582
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,080
it's sets it back further and if I was

583
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,720
to say anything I would not pick up I'd

584
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,939
say let's just start doing it where it

585
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,159
accumulates consistently for two to

586
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,080
three weeks and then we're back in

587
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,700
business you you hit the key word there

588
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,558
right that's where I was going to end up

589
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,360
it's that consistent I think that

590
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:23,038
consistency needs to be a part of it

591
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,019
right if you're going through January

592
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,940
and you have a day here and a day there

593
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:28,740
or even into February March and you have

594
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,480
a day here that's very different than

595
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,700
this prolonged period of time where

596
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,500
where you know the biology of the turf

597
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,659
or whatever can kind of pick up and do

598
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,720
it I think in a lot of cases you know

599
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:41,700
the the fruit guys are maybe a little

600
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,279
bit more sophisticated with you right

601
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,860
because there they have a they have a

602
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,599
distinct measure on you know right you

603
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:50,699
have this idea of chilling right the

604
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,500
buds in an apple tree have to get a

605
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,419
certain amount of chill and that's when

606
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,339
you start to accumulate the degree days

607
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:58,140
it says all right we've gone through the

608
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:59,699
winter we've done our stuff we've gotten

609
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,620
enough of this and now I can start to

610
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,460
wake up but there doesn't seem to be

611
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:07,259
that that in in in the case of of turf

612
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,298
or or even insects and and things like

613
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,158
that so one of the things we've been

614
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,319
talking about uh we have for the last

615
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,539
couple of years and there's there's been

616
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:18,240
some research going on in

617
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:21,000
um Minnesota particularly on this uh the

618
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,579
concept of a false Spring right that

619
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,038
concept of fall spring can you just take

620
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:28,980
a minute and describe I mean this is a

621
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:31,019
is this a relatively new phenomenon as

622
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,000
part of the a signal of climate change

623
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:34,619
or is have the Springs always been

624
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
screwed up like this

625
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:38,038
um I don't know if they've always been

626
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,759
screwed up on that it's more

627
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:41,640
um

628
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:45,179
it's more um it's become more prevalent

629
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,460
in in a changing climate I mean I can go

630
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,679
way back right back in my South Dakota

631
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,620
days we did some work actually with with

632
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,179
tree rings so long records and that was

633
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:56,158
one of the things you looked at in the

634
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:58,140
trees this idea of false Springs you

635
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,900
could get these very very short small

636
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,580
Rings where the trees start to start to

637
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,740
go crazy in the spring and then it gets

638
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:06,418
really cold and you know we all know we

639
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,880
count the number of rings to see how old

640
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,620
the tree is right um but in those cases

641
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,900
there's like two rings there's that

642
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:14,699
false ring because the spring started so

643
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,620
this has been a phenomena that has gone

644
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,720
on you know for a long time right we're

645
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:20,038
looking at Thousand Year records in some

646
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,960
of these trees

647
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:23,099
um I I do think it becomes more

648
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,220
prevalent

649
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:27,480
um as as as we move on again we did some

650
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,640
work with

651
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,099
um we did some work with frost risk and

652
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,960
apples Frost damage and apples and and

653
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:35,699
the key thing that we see it's the

654
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,100
variation in the temperature right we

655
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,019
can warm up as much as we get and

656
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:43,139
there's really not this idea of fall

657
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,579
spring but as the as the variance the

658
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,140
day-to-day change becomes different

659
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:48,658
that's the thing that gives you that

660
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,038
that false spring that you know again in

661
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:52,200
the case of an apple blossom they

662
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:54,000
develop and then boom you get hit with a

663
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,340
frost and and it's down you know there

664
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,319
it's a one day thing in in what we're

665
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:01,079
talking about here I would say with Turf

666
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,178
we need a more prolonged period of time

667
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:08,158
of of it being cooler and having a fall

668
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:09,900
spring okay so Carl are there questions

669
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,340
yeah and there's a great question from

670
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,798
Jason Griffiths that goes right along

671
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:15,000
with this so he said he got some uh some

672
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:16,918
significant Growing Degree days in

673
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,140
mid-February but the soil Temps at two

674
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,299
inch two inches were still down at 31

675
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,340
degrees yeah he's asking how much is

676
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:25,200
that a key to keep the plan in dormancy

677
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:27,298
which for Turf is good right we don't

678
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,620
want it to acclimate 100 early because

679
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:30,240
then it's going to be more susceptible

680
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:33,959
to Winter kill what would you say to

681
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,579
that right yeah you first start I in

682
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,200
some ways I think that's the easy thing

683
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:38,339
to look at here right I mean we're

684
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,679
looking we're doing air temperature

685
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:42,538
we're not doing soil temperature so a

686
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,700
good case you could accumulate Degree

687
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:46,200
Days in in February but there's a foot

688
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,759
of snow on the ground right so that's

689
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,960
the easy thing to say hey these don't

690
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,278
count

691
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,558
um starting to look at the soil

692
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:54,778
temperature and if the soils are Frozen

693
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,519
um we we do get some data on that so

694
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:59,759
that might be another way of kind of

695
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:02,099
tempering what goes on in the spring

696
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,538
so art when you said you know the

697
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:05,219
simplistic Growing Degree day

698
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:07,379
calculations

699
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,480
um uh

700
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,020
how much of a difference you think there

701
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,480
is between doing it daily hourly Am Pm

702
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:17,339
we had an entomologist on Ben McGraw

703
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,140
from Penn State who pays attention to

704
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:20,819
this a little bit he he drew some

705
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,860
attention to the differences the way

706
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:24,720
they're calculated can you take a minute

707
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:27,538
I mean I think number one ours on our

708
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,400
websites are daily right daily right but

709
00:26:27,538 --> 00:26:32,220
what about the differences in measuring

710
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,320
the more uh granularly well I mean I I

711
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,360
have two things there they're totally

712
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,918
going to be different right I mean you

713
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:39,658
have you know you you can think of a

714
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,900
specialty spring days if we're using

715
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:45,120
base you know base 50 or let's you know

716
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,400
as a degree day you have many days in

717
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,979
the in the mid to late spring where the

718
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,600
the daytime temperatures above 50 but

719
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,000
it's still below freezing at night right

720
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,918
so if you average that out then you get

721
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,259
zero degree days even though a good

722
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,000
chunk of the day what was in the 50s and

723
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,700
presumably that the plants were

724
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,859
responding to that however so yeah there

725
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,538
you do get a significant difference I I

726
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:08,939
think the numbers we look at about maybe

727
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:12,839
10 percent per particularly if you do it

728
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:14,580
hourly versus daily however however it

729
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,259
really doesn't matter that it depends on

730
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:18,240
what the models were built at so if

731
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:21,000
somebody built the model all on daily

732
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,679
values right that's that's right that's

733
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,380
that's what you're using in the model so

734
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,240
if you're saying this disease this

735
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,100
insects this whatever is going to occur

736
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,778
at this many Degree Days what's really

737
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:33,119
important to go back to literature and

738
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:35,159
say hey how did they compute okay so in

739
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:38,339
fact my question was good

740
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,960
a degree day is not a degree day when

741
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:42,538
there's a foot of snow on the ground and

742
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,819
to Jason's Point well done a degree day

743
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:47,460
is not a degree day if the soil is at 30

744
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:52,139
degrees and Frozen so I think it's

745
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:54,058
probably worth uh in places like that uh

746
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,580
really paying attention to it but at the

747
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:59,879
same time you know as you get further

748
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:03,240
south art right they have you know it's

749
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,278
it's it seems to be progressing in the

750
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,500
metropolitan areas in the urban areas

751
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,359
can you take one more second with our

752
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,480
Urban environmental scientist here and

753
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:16,859
talk about how this warming potentially

754
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:20,038
impacts grass areas around cities more

755
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:22,199
than it might uh in rural areas yeah I

756
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:23,940
mean I think this is a good winter to

757
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,740
actually just go out and look at that

758
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,778
I'm sure if you walk around New York

759
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,359
City or actually even on campus here if

760
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:32,700
you've been past Roberts Hall

761
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:34,678
um the witch hazel is already in bloom

762
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,659
it's it's bright yellow basically right

763
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,340
and same thing we did some more we did

764
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:40,980
some new stuff in the city where the

765
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:42,899
trees are are actually In Bloom and you

766
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,000
know that that City environment just

767
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,519
adds so much to the temperature it kind

768
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,460
of tempers those fluctuations that we

769
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,859
talk about so um in those types of

770
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,259
environments yeah it's it's key actually

771
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:58,139
because the mass heats up right all that

772
00:28:55,259 --> 00:29:00,058
paved Mass right yep and it's it's like

773
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,500
a big old heat it's like a big old heat

774
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:03,480
sink right it's like you know sitting

775
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,919
around the campfire and the rocks are

776
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,319
still hot in the morning basically

777
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:08,159
that's right all right art well there we

778
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,519
go the

779
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:15,000
30 minutes Carl we defied the space-time

780
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,679
Continuum thanks for coming art we turn

781
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,240
right through it yeah thanks a town art

782
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,519
uh thank you always always a pleasure

783
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,259
Carl and Frank yep it's uh thanks thanks

784
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:23,339
everyone for joining today uh we'll be

785
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:25,259
back right again tomorrow with our

786
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:26,459
Sports show uh one of our attendees

787
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:27,778
today Ben polymer is going to be on

788
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,399
tomorrow we're going to quiz band on

789
00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:31,259
some spring some of the spring

790
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:34,259
maintenance practices he does and a new

791
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:36,058
uh New England Regional BMP document for

792
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:37,859
the Sportster looking forward to it good

793
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:41,099
conversation thanks everyone we'll see

794
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:43,798
you tomorrow thanks Carl see art
