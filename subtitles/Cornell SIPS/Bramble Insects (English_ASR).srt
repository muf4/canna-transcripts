1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,798
and you can see that red a raspberry

2
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:13,638
Crown B has really devastated the Vigor

3
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:15,678
of these plants and the

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:18,640
productivity at this point when we were

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,359
doing some insecticide efficacy studies

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,920
uh we had greater than five raspberry

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,080
Crown boore larv per plant and this is

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,400
what the plants look

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:31,320
like

10
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:33,600
biology and identification

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,359
this is a clearwing

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,960
moth it's native to areas from New

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,679
England to Georgia and west of Nebraska

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,799
and South to Louisiana it's been

15
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:49,840
reported damaging plants in British

16
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,839
Columbia and California and even in New

17
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:58,479
Mexico identification you can

18
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:00,479
see the adults have these

19
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,919
yellow boms

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,959
makes them look like a yellow

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,359
jacket and the the young the larvey are

22
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:14,879
in the in the cane or in the crown and

23
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:17,359
they're just a typical white cead or

24
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,000
clearwing

25
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,759
moth

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,159
hosts typically in in Arkansas we see

27
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,920
them mostly a damaging Blackberry but

28
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,118
they are reported to get on DeBerry and

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,240
raspberry further

30
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:34,719
north symptoms tunneling in the

31
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:38,319
crown sometime

32
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:42,078
in May and June you start seeing them

33
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,078
tunneling into the lower part of the

34
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,839
cane and here you can actually see

35
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,118
inside there inside that tunnel the head

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,118
of the

37
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,839
larvae canes are girdled at the base and

38
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,920
they Wilt as you can see to the right

39
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,359
here it kind of it looks like a

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,320
shepherd's Crook and they're dead all

41
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:10,598
the way to the soil line and this type

42
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,598
of thing happens in June July and

43
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,799
August and as I mentioned in the

44
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,479
previous slide yields do drop

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,640
considerably and the plants will

46
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:23,799
eventually die if they get enough laral

47
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:26,598
damage

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,800
biology eggs are laid on the underside

49
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:32,000
of the

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,840
leaf The larva walks down the cane to

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,519
just below the soil line and then

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,479
tunnels into the side of the cane where

53
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,759
it over Winters this is a photo from

54
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,399
Washington

55
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:45,799
State then in the spring starting in

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,519
early April in our area and probably

57
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,280
more likely May further north uh the

58
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,239
larvae tunnels in the in the

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,000
crowns and you can

60
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,080
see in the South we have 11mon life

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
cycle where it finishes in one full year

62
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,719
and in the north it actually takes a

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,719
full two years as a larva 22

64
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,280
months sometime in the fall I think in

65
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,598
the further north you start seeing these

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,919
pupil

67
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:23,518
skins um coming out in late August early

68
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:26,238
September in our area it comes out more

69
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,239
like in mid-september and you can find

70
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,400
adults throughout most of September or

71
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:35,680
October

72
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,680
and here's a a both a male and a

73
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:43,840
female there's a mating

74
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:47,158
pair and during the day you can find

75
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,280
females in this

76
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:54,479
posture where you can actually see them

77
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,959
curling their abdomen under the leaf and

78
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:00,598
laying an

79
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,840
egg scouting there's two way ways of

80
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,919
scouting in July you if you're just

81
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,640
looking for damage you can actually look

82
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,759
for

83
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,318
the dying

84
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,158
canes and in Tris plantings a lot of

85
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,919
times the canes don't get to move very

86
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:17,279
much with the wind and they don't break

87
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:20,358
off at the

88
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,279
bottom so you don't see the dying

89
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,198
cane uh but later in the season you can

90
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,119
also

91
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,680
cut and look for the larvae in the hole

92
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,000
in the tunnel

93
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,720
in September or late August you can look

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,839
for females laying eggs or you can

95
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,880
actually look for

96
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,038
eggs now in terms of

97
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,279
control we have been working on some

98
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:46,959
biological

99
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:49,638
control and we've also been testing

100
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,839
various other

101
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,759
insecticides cultural control if the

102
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,319
population isn't too high you can

103
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,759
actually find which plants are infested

104
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:03,399
in in July before they p at and remove

105
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,400
the

106
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:13,919
plant we have been having slight success

107
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,919
using biological

108
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,799
control and this is something that we

109
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,399
find that sometime at Bud break in

110
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,639
Spring um we can irrigate soil drench

111
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,959
the plants with some

112
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,540
nematodes but the best we've done so far

113
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,439
is about 53% reduction in l

114
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,919
[Music]

115
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:37,839
count this is research done by my

116
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,839
student Jackie

117
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:44,038
mccar we have done both releases

118
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:52,000
of nematodes s FTI H bacteria 4 and S

119
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,519
caroc capsi you can see the

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,720
rate and the dates late October this is

121
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,159
after egg

122
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,240
hatch may this is really about the time

123
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,400
when the larve in our area have started

124
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,598
moving up into the the

125
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:11,359
cane again we try to second year in

126
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:14,079
November with applications and then the

127
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,319
following year we did it right at

128
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,800
budwell uh trying to make sure we got

129
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,319
the

130
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,918
larvey here you can see the results of

131
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:28,400
correct timed applications we can get

132
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,918
anywhere from 80 to 100%

133
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,560
control

134
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,598
Brigade or Guth is now cancelled it used

135
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,800
to be our standard compound as a soil

136
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:40,279
drench but Brigade which is by fenin

137
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,319
works real

138
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,918
well and that's the only thing

139
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,000
registered right

140
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:50,959
now some of our Growers did not like the

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
label it says use a use 200 gallons per

142
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:59,478
acre of this material so we

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,839
tried 50 100 and 200 gallon rates as is

144
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:01,839
a soil

145
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:09,439
drench and you can see we had similar

146
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:12,240
fairly similar control with all rates

147
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:15,240
from 50 to 200 gallons but right now the

148
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,240
label says

149
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,160
200 you can see in May when the larvey

150
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,800
have already tunneled into the crown

151
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,520
they're pretty much unexposed to

152
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,319
pesticide and they also it's very

153
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:32,079
difficult for

154
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:35,000
nematodes we had very few nematodes

155
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:38,560
controlling the larv at that

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,399
time compared to an earlier application

157
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,280
just when they're starting to feed on

158
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,359
the on the

159
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:48,399
canes so we do have some success with b

160
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,400
control but not a whole

161
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:57,000
lot now applying your soil drench

162
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,839
whether it be nematodes or uh

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,279
insecticide you have to keep a weed free

164
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:07,439
strip so the material gets down to the

165
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:10,119
crown weeds cause poor

166
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:13,079
coverage here you can see our tractor

167
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,800
driver uh trying to apply this

168
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,719
material to the base of the plants but

169
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,079
he has to go through all that

170
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,360
grass and in this case he's applying

171
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:27,038
that egg hatch which is in October in

172
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,319
our area or even as late as early

173
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,399
November and you can actually delay

174
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,719
until Bud break in the spring which is

175
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:37,399
April in our area which may be May in

176
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,800
yours and like I said Brigade is the

177
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,799
only thing

178
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:52,200
registered okay um I've moved my speaker

179
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,039
a little bit away from my mouth is that

180
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,240
any

181
00:08:54,039 --> 00:09:01,159
better I I think it's good Don I think

182
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:04,720
uh okay yeah I I think it's okay

183
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:07,278
green June beetle uh you can see you can

184
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,079
see this map in the green are all the

185
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,200
locations where they've been reported

186
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:14,120
feeding on ripening

187
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,278
fruit so if you're outside that area you

188
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,240
can ignore the next few minutes but it's

189
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:19,240
an interesting

190
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:29,399
insect identification the adults have

191
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,880
these almost fluorescent green wings

192
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:35,480
they're from 1 to 1 and 12 in Long the

193
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,439
larvae is a grub it's

194
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,320
c-shaped and has a vertical

195
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:46,600
roster you can see that right here these

196
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,600
hairs are in a two rows

197
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,079
vertically these are the hosts they

198
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:58,399
attack ripening

199
00:09:54,078 --> 00:10:01,120
fruit you see grapes apples and you can

200
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,120
get them on black

201
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,399
berries typically most of our

202
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,879
blackberries are almost finishing uh by

203
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,679
the time the adults come out here you

204
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:15,439
can see the adults coming out in mostly

205
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,439
in July and

206
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,079
August there's a larvae it's easy to

207
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:25,159
recognize it's you usually nocturnal but

208
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,599
it ambles Along on its back in the

209
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:31,000
grassy

210
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:35,200
areas pupates in the soil in a soil

211
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,958
cell you get some adults coming out in

212
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,040
late June early July they lay eggs they

213
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:45,359
get hungry go feed on fruit anything

214
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:48,120
ripe the ly feed on decomposed organic

215
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,560
matter so if you have a pasture with

216
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,759
Organic Matter U manure that's where

217
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:57,199
they'll

218
00:10:52,759 --> 00:11:00,720
be we do have a rearing method for our

219
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:04,320
various studies we just use soil with

220
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,639
some alala meal as a nutrient Source in

221
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,120
may we can actually sift the

222
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:16,120
soil we get the pupil cells get some of

223
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,120
the larv there's a soil cell right

224
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:22,799
there and we can sex The Beetles the

225
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,440
adults can looks like two Cat's Eyes on

226
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,439
the female and this more horizontal

227
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,959
structure on the on the male in terms of

228
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,959
their abdomen tip

229
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,919
we've been developing a trap for Mass

230
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:35,919
trapping green je

231
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,638
beetles and you can see the the Box on

232
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,320
the upper left we have we catch

233
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,079
thousands of these beetles so we had to

234
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,600
increase the Trap capture

235
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,078
size we have a green June beetle lure

236
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,440
that's actually available like from

237
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,559
Great Lakes

238
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,959
IPM which we

239
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:04,399
developed and also also uh we use 90 91%

240
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:08,039
isopropanol and you can see that both of

241
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:12,278
those uh give fairly similar counts

242
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:15,679
10,000 14,000 this is a week count in

243
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:20,159
one week's time we catch that

244
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:22,879
many green Gene Beetle control uh

245
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:25,519
there's a number of

246
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,838
compounds registered for green Jean

247
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,360
beetles but most of them have more than

248
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,199
a three-day preh Harvest interval and

249
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,360
what you're trying to do is get them off

250
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:37,479
ripening fruit so it's it's kind of a

251
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,079
tricky deal to find the right

252
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,360
compound Mass trapping so far has not

253
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,479
been effective after our first year but

254
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,079
we think that using several traps around

255
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:51,079
a planning we may after several years be

256
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:55,239
able to mass trap the population out of

257
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:58,000
the area so they'll be below damaging

258
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,079
levels I know Japanese beetle is in your

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,078
area you you can see this is the

260
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:06,319
distribution map anything in

261
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:09,919
purple so basically

262
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,320
anything from Iowa Minnesota Iowa

263
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,240
Missouri

264
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,800
Arkansas and Georgia North to all the

265
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,799
way into Vermont and and

266
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,360
Maine just for your information I'm

267
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:26,838
located in this Hotpot right here

268
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,839
Northwest

269
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,799
Arkansas Japanese beetle

270
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,800
D fairly easy

271
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:37,879
to identify it's about half the size of

272
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:41,479
a green jein beetle has brown

273
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:43,799
wings has these six white spots on the

274
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,039
side of the abdomen with this nice

275
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,039
couple toughs on the

276
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:56,559
tip C shaped larva and a v

277
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,759
raster that's this kind of v-shaped

278
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,758
hairs right

279
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
here

280
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,399
Japanese beetle is an introduced pest

281
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,240
from

282
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,320
Japan 300 species of plants that it

283
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,879
feeds on and mostly it's a

284
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,320
defoliator but you can see on the crepe

285
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,799
or crab apple in the middle it will feed

286
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,160
on fruit and it does get on blackberries

287
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,679
but we see more damage on the leaves and

288
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,679
the and the

289
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,680
flowers recently Maxi and Fifer produced

290
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,000
this nice graph showing the number of

291
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:41,479
Japanese beetles per 2 m a

292
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,720
row relative to several varieties of

293
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,199
raspberry and you can see that the first

294
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,360
four are

295
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:53,479
very low in terms of Japanese beetle

296
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,278
counts but then you get uh Autumn Bliss

297
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,680
fall gold and Prelude seem to be a

298
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,439
little bit more

299
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,319
susceptible

300
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,279
Japanese beetles differ in defoliation

301
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,079
of those same raspberry varieties here

302
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:11,360
you can see percent

303
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:14,039
defoliation and again fall gold Autumn

304
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,039
Bliss and Prelude seem to have the most

305
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,799
folar damage but even 5% doesn't seem to

306
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,439
be a whole lot but in our area it tends

307
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:26,240
to be more the leaves around the

308
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,240
flowers so that could be

309
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,600
damaging scouting in control

310
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,319
Japanese beetles come out in June in our

311
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,639
area uh July up in

312
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:42,240
Michigan and you can see they like to

313
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,680
feed on things on the top part of plants

314
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,000
these are this is grapes they just

315
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:50,599
skeletonize the top part of the

316
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,159
plant and our Growers ever since they've

317
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,360
been here since about 2002 we've been

318
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,399
having to apply weekly insecticides to

319
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,560
prevent that

320
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:03,360
defoliation this this year we tried

321
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:06,879
using surround K and Clay on the plants

322
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,039
and you can see the difference in

323
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:12,559
defoliation we' drastically reduced the

324
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,198
defoliation with the surround but ever

325
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,359
after every rainfall we've had to

326
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:19,000
reapply it to maintain that whitewashed

327
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:24,839
look so that does seem to be a a good

328
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,839
alternative to several weekly sprays of

329
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:32,479
insecticide okay our last the

330
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,040
last insect I'll organism I'll talk

331
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,839
about is a broad Mite this is a new pest

332
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,439
in our area it's usually a problem in

333
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,440
Greenhouse plants in temperate and

334
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,000
subtropical

335
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,880
regions as you can see it gets on pepper

336
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,720
and

337
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:52,078
impatients and causes Leaf

338
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,319
deformation but in 2007 we actually

339
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:57,479
found this on priman Berry and

340
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:59,318
blackberry Prime Arc

341
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,959
46

342
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,599
and I'll address the Japanese beetle

343
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:06,599
traps here in a second I saw that come

344
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:10,078
up

345
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:13,399
um on the far right you can see promane

346
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,399
Blackberry being

347
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,038
damaged here's the broad Mite

348
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:21,720
distribution with all the little black

349
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,078
dots these are the two new locations in

350
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,558
Arkansas North

351
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:28,000
Carolina we found them in both locations

352
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:31,558
I don't know what it is about Primark 46

353
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
but it seems to the broad Mite seems to

354
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:37,279
like that

355
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,160
cultivar what does it look

356
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,000
like you can see it's about a tenth of a

357
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,038
millimeter in size they're not very big

358
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,200
the

359
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:52,400
males are yellow have longer

360
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,400
legs the

361
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:57,440
female is more

362
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:00,400
white and it kind of you can almost see

363
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,400
the egg inside the Fe

364
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:08,879
fale and then the egg is clear with

365
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:11,720
those 30 29 to 37 white tuffs very

366
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,360
characteristic what does it

367
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,159
do

368
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:20,158
acce pictures are infested plants

369
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:23,919
compared to the healthy plants BDF you

370
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:27,400
can see it greatly reduces uh cluster

371
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,120
size and leaf size and it curs curls the

372
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,000
leaves

373
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,038
management uh we're just starting to

374
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,200
learn how to manage these but we did use

375
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:41,158
some predatory mites we we purchased and

376
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:45,759
released uh predatory

377
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:47,480
mites and javic has also indicated that

378
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,720
he used neocis

379
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,360
californicus and got fairly good control

380
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,360
um on

381
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:00,279
pepper might decides of course that are

382
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,519
labeled that you can find broad might on

383
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:05,839
the label and some of the insecticidal

384
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:05,839
Soaps and and

385
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:12,880
oils these are many of the Publications

386
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,879
that I mentioned during the

387
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:22,359
presentation and just to acknowledge

388
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,120
some of our funding sources in organic

389
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:26,000
or integrated organic program ir4 minor

390
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,319
use

391
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,880
program uh we also have some funding

392
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,879
from our uh small fruit

393
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,639
Consortium at this point I'll try to

394
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,038
answer any questions I guess I can go

395
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,280
back and answer that question about

396
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:47,000
Japanese beetle traps yeah we've used

397
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:49,279
Japanese beetle traps around um a grape

398
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,119
vineyard we had like 17 traps we could

399
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,119
only trap on one side because there was

400
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,959
cows that were eating our traps on the

401
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,279
other

402
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:00,360
sides and we trapped over a million

403
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,639
Japanese beetles and there was still the

404
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,359
grower still applied three sprays in his

405
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,799
Vineyard and was still losing foliage so

406
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,000
in a very high

407
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,759
population Japanese beetle traps will

408
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
not mass trap and remove enough to

409
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,000
prevent having to use

410
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:20,839
insecticide um do we have any other

411
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:24,120
comments or questions for Dr Johnson uh

412
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:26,519
I think people are typing and maybe oops

413
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,519
um there's another one the with the same

414
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,079
cultural controls for Crown board work

415
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:32,440
with cane

416
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,759
bore yeah I think uh Hannah will

417
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,640
probably mention that um she'll be

418
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:39,558
talking about redneck can boore and one

419
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,000
of the controls is if you have about

420
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:44,879
less than 5 to 10% of your canes Gall

421
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,319
you can remove those during the pruning

422
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,440
period but if it gets above 10% you're

423
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:53,558
starting to cut into your yield by quite

424
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,480
a bit uh so that's kind of where we do a

425
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:56,879
cut

426
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,599
off and then there's a question from

427
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,440
Marvin pritz about the photo um showing

428
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,719
the big differences in Crown board

429
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,240
damage and whether that was the age of

430
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,880
the planting or the cultivar that

431
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,880
provided that

432
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:16,200
difference well the the cultivar in the

433
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:18,278
back and that second very second slide

434
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,159
was very new that was about 2 years old

435
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:23,119
go back to that and then the cultivar in

436
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:26,480
the front yeah I think it was slide two

437
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:29,359
I don't know where it's at really it's

438
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,278
slide four

439
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,319
um yeah that

440
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:36,359
one these are 2ye

441
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,639
olds these are about seven or

442
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:41,639
eight-year-old Navajo these are I think

443
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,640
it was Apache or

444
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:48,079
aapo and then Jeff Miller had a question

445
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,600
about the mode of action of the clay

446
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:53,399
application and that's just a surface

447
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:56,719
kind of thing right yeah it it's

448
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,038
basically makes the the leaves white and

449
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,240
it also creates a

450
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:04,798
kind of a dust on the on the plant so I

451
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,278
think one the Japanese beetles don't see

452
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,720
the plant as a yellow plant they see it

453
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:12,640
as a white structure so it's kind of

454
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,159
camouflaged and two I think it really

455
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,640
they spend more time cleaning their

456
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,200
mouth parts and their legs when they're

457
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:22,000
on those leaves so it it's kind of a

458
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,880
disturbing uh dirty appearance on their

459
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,038
food it's it'd be kind of like

460
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,720
us putting sand in our in our food and

461
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,879
trying to eat that it's not very

462
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,200
appetizing I don't think it kills any

463
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,200
and then there's a question about the

464
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,798
application and I think around us we

465
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,200
just spray it on is that how you yeah

466
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:43,759
it's all sprayed on and it's one of

467
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,440
those things you have to be patient with

468
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,960
because it kind of goes on slow you

469
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,278
spray it once I had a commercial grower

470
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,558
used his Air Blast sprayer he he went

471
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:54,319
down the roow once and looked at it and

472
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,278
he said well it's still not quite white

473
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,720
enough so he went again and it took

474
00:22:56,278 --> 00:23:01,440
about two or three trips to get get it

475
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,159
to a accumulate to kind of a whitewashed

476
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,038
appearance the challenge to keep it

477
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:08,480
agitated too I know that's an

478
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:11,278
issue yeah you have to have an you have

479
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,440
to have an agitator uh system in your

480
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:16,839
tank or if you're doing it by backpack

481
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,720
you do a lot of

482
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:21,439
dancing a lot of dancing I I just wanted

483
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,120
to comment to those people who think

484
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,600
that the June beetle might not be an

485
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,119
issue for New York and New England but

486
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,519
certainly in the Hudson Valley we've

487
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:33,239
seen these in sex um and I think that

488
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:35,679
probably in the lower Southern Tier they

489
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,599
may have seen them uh and perhaps

490
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,880
certain areas of um New England as well

491
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:43,199
so that it's we're not completely out of

492
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,159
the woods with that one and I just

493
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,679
wanted to ask a question quickly before

494
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,559
we move on but um the broad Mite that

495
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,519
you're talking about is it the ex is it

496
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:53,879
the same broad Mite that's a greenhouse

497
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:57,960
pest is that what you said

498
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,520
earlier okay yeah right thank you thank

499
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,558
you very much does anyone else have any

500
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,440
questions or comments for Dr Johnson he

501
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,839
will be here through the next

502
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,679
presentation so perhaps at the end and I

503
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:13,839
think we'll okay great thank you yes

504
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:16,440
let's move on to our second speaker

505
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:19,839
um

506
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,159
things here I'll turn mine

507
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:25,398
[Music]

508
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,559
off this is um I'd like to introduce Dr

509
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:31,639
Hannah Barack um she is from North

510
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,678
Carolina State University and is the uh

511
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,840
an assistant professor and extension

512
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:40,120
specialist there she actually has um

513
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:43,278
some responsibilities with small fruits

514
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:45,359
as well as tobacco working to enhance

515
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,679
Pest Management in both of these crops

516
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,519
she's interested in landscape scale

517
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,240
management issues host preference

518
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:57,359
behavior of insects and invasive species

519
00:24:53,240 --> 00:25:00,240
biology so I'm very happy to have uh Dr

520
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:03,479
Barack join us to talk about U more

521
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,480
caneberry insect

522
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:10,678
management are you able to turn on

523
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,879
your sorry

524
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:26,480
oh can you hear me all right

525
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:31,880
now

526
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,600
I have the little mic icon can you okay

527
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,919
excellent excellent all right so I'm

528
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,798
going to go ahead and get started here I

529
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,640
have um just one quick comment about

530
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:41,480
Japanese beetle traps and Surround first

531
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,720
of all Don I'm incredibly impressed that

532
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,519
you apply surround with a backpack um my

533
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,159
experience with that has always been the

534
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,759
rates of the material you have to use

535
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,120
make it a pretty heavy duty amount of of

536
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,000
clay that's going on there and um I

537
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,678
actually worked on it uh in olives in

538
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,880
California and to get good coverage on

539
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,159
tree crops is particularly challenging

540
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,919
you need a lot of water and a lot of

541
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,159
clay so it's a pretty heavy duty process

542
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:06,880
and then uh just to comment briefly on

543
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,880
Japanese beetle traps we actually

544
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,520
discourage Growers from using them in

545
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,960
North Carolina because the lures are

546
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:17,398
incredibly attractive they'll draw

547
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,319
beetles in from a great distance but um

548
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:21,158
they don't actually as Don said trap

549
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:22,918
them out of the area they've been shown

550
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,399
to pull beetles in from as far away as

551
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,080
up to a mile so basically you're putting

552
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:28,678
out a little signal that you've got

553
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:30,720
something interesting they should come

554
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,399
check out and along the way they might

555
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,519
find your planting in addition to the

556
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:38,199
Trap itself so we we don't recommend the

557
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:41,000
use for the the use of them by Growers

558
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,840
because typically they tend to either

559
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,480
not help with the problem or potentially

560
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:47,839
make it worse and I'm going to focus on

561
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,720
another set of caneberry pests

562
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,038
particularly some Beatles mites talk a

563
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,558
little about thrips work that we're

564
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,720
doing and I'll talk briefly about some

565
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:57,599
potential pests Laura mentioned that I

566
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,240
have an interest in invasive species bi

567
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,480
biology so that'll come out a little bit

568
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,399
at the end of this talk as

569
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,440
well but first I want to acknowledge

570
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:09,278
some folks who've done a the bulk of the

571
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,159
Canberry work before I arrived in the

572
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,558
Southeast you've heard from Don this

573
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,559
afternoon and Don presented some work

574
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:17,639
that's been done by Doug feifer and his

575
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:19,278
graduate student Laura Maxi I'll also

576
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,840
have some information of theirs in this

577
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,480
talk as well and I also want to

578
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,639
highlight one of my Horticulture

579
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,880
counterparts down here at NC State Gina

580
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,159
Fernandez she is the Berry

581
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,000
horticulturalist as well as a breeder um

582
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:35,200
looking particularly at developing some

583
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,880
heat tolerant raspberries because those

584
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,440
of y'all north of us get to grow all

585
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,640
sorts of great raspberries but we're

586
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,640
stuck uh in the Southeast with the the

587
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,360
inability to grow raspberries in the

588
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,679
warmer parts of the state here I also

589
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:49,519
wanted to highlight a couple Internet

590
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:52,480
Resources um Laura mentioned my blog and

591
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,079
feel free to check that out I post about

592
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,919
two to three times a week and I try to

593
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,839
keep that fairly up to date if there's

594
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,480
any comments that you have on that feel

595
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:00,480
free to post them there or get in touch

596
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,599
with me if there's something you'd like

597
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,480
to learn more about and then my personal

598
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:06,959
website is here we're in the process of

599
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,440
De of developing integrated Pest

600
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,240
Management web pages as a part of this

601
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:16,840
website so that's in process as

602
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,359
well I want to talk a little bit about

603
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:20,599
um my philosophy of integrated Pest

604
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:22,240
Management before we jump in here um

605
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:24,759
primarily because I'll be talking about

606
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,038
IPM in the context of this presentation

607
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,480
and I want to make sure we're all on the

608
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:31,200
same page first so so when I think of

609
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,159
IPM I think of the three M's and for me

610
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,919
that's minimize Monitor and manage and

611
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,799
practically what that means is we

612
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,000
minimize the likelihood of having a pest

613
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:44,519
problem in our planting by reducing the

614
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,599
things or changing the things we can to

615
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:49,679
result in a the least hospitable

616
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:52,519
environment for pest as

617
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:56,080
possible secondly we monitor our pest

618
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:58,759
populations which means we track both on

619
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,079
an individual point in time and through

620
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:03,599
time to see what our pest populations

621
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:05,359
are doing also under here are some

622
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:06,839
things that Don touched on really well

623
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,079
specifically we need to know what

624
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:10,678
insects we have so those ID techniques

625
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,199
are really important and that falls

626
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:15,120
under monitoring and finally manage and

627
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,200
this is the thing we tend to think about

628
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:20,678
first when it comes to integrated Pest

629
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,960
Management but really it's a logical

630
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:25,559
outflow of these first two minimizing

631
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,319
and monitoring then we decide whether or

632
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:29,319
not we have a pest problem that requires

633
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,760
management so the ways we manage pest

634
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,558
are threefold and again I have these

635
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,038
listed kind of in terms of hierarchy

636
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,480
first off we start off with cultural

637
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:47,480
control those are the things we do in

638
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,640
that minimized category we select the

639
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,000
right variety we fertilize in the way

640
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,278
that's appropriate for Pest Management

641
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,759
we um prune in ways that reduce our pest

642
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,919
population I'll talk about how some of

643
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,000
those tools apply to specific Canberry

644
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,320
pths as we get further in here

645
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,278
biocontrol is the second tier I like to

646
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:06,798
exploit so first we do everything

647
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,159
culturally we can to make the least

648
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,599
hospitable place for pests secondly we

649
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:12,399
move in and see if there's cultural

650
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:14,839
control techniques that are appro or

651
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,558
sorry biological control techniques that

652
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:19,839
are appropriate for the pests that we're

653
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:22,918
trying to Target and again these are

654
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,839
things like using Predators um or as Don

655
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,320
mentioned using nematodes those are

656
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:28,839
different biological control organisms

657
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:31,879
that we can utilize in the Canberry

658
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:34,000
system and then third I like to consider

659
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,320
chemical control after we've considered

660
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,839
the first two and I break down organic

661
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:40,439
versus conventional because I think a

662
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:44,278
lot of folks particularly people who

663
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,399
aren't producers get organic kind of

664
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:48,640
thrown all up in there and really

665
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,839
organic producers still to a certain

666
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,799
extent may use chemical controls they're

667
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:56,558
just omy acceptable chemical

668
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:59,119
controls so as long as we're talking

669
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,398
about chemicals let me first mention um

670
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,839
I'm not going to be talking about a lot

671
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:05,278
of pesticides in this talk and that's

672
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:07,558
primarily because all of you all are

673
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,558
from different parts of the country so

674
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,839
both pest status and biology are going

675
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:13,879
to differ based on where we are where

676
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,038
there are differences between people in

677
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,399
the Northeast and the southeast I'll

678
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:20,278
point out because I think that's where

679
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:22,719
most of our folks are from and in

680
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:25,440
general the insect pests covered in this

681
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,720
talk are east of the Mississippi so I'll

682
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,519
point out any Critters that might differ

683
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,038
along those lines but there's as Don

684
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,079
showed in some of the maps that he

685
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:36,558
Illustrated with most of the organisms

686
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:39,439
that we're going to talk about are

687
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:42,158
Canberry pasts East in the

688
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,240
Mississippi so biological and cultural

689
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,440
control methods can generally be

690
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,759
generalized over lots of different

691
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:54,000
places using predatory mites using

692
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,798
nematodes pruning those are things we

693
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,679
can do pretty much anywhere but the time

694
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,119
at which you do those might change so

695
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:02,519
bear that in mind when I talk about

696
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:04,719
those methods chemical control options

697
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,880
specifically pesticides are not

698
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,038
generalizable registrations for

699
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,639
materials differ between states so I may

700
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,000
slip and mention some specific

701
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:16,798
pesticides at points in this talk but

702
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,278
contact your local Cooperative Extension

703
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:21,638
folks for local recommendations about

704
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:24,319
which materials are registered and

705
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:26,479
recommended for the pest in your area

706
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,158
because the label is the law that's the

707
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,720
most important thing to follow whenever

708
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,399
you're using a pesticide if it's not

709
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,558
labeled for the use that you're using it

710
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:38,319
for you cannot be using

711
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:40,839
it so this is a a timeline for the

712
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,359
southeast for some of the Canberry pests

713
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:44,480
that Don mentioned and that I'll be

714
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:46,558
mentioning um I have the months down

715
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,759
here along the bottom but I also broke

716
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:52,158
out the plant phenological timings along

717
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,839
with that so for those of you who are

718
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,159
not in the Southeast refer to the bloom

719
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,720
fruit development and harvest timings as

720
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:00,799
for when these organisms are going to be

721
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,960
showing up I'll be talking a little bit

722
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:05,278
about Clippers let me hop ahead to the

723
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,000
next slide here I'll be talking a little

724
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:10,440
bit about Clippers about cane bores

725
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,240
about stink bugs thrips and two spotted

726
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,960
spidermites so let's jump right into

727
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,638
those so we already already had a

728
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,278
question about cane bores we've got two

729
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:23,638
different cane bores in this system the

730
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:26,079
first one that I'm going to talk about

731
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:27,558
is the raspberry cane boore it's a Lorn

732
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,678
Beetle you can see where it gets its

733
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:33,440
name from it has these lawn and tenny

734
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:37,200
and it's actually in the same genus as

735
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,960
the rasp uh the blueberry stemor so this

736
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,840
is a Genus that is an issue on other

737
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,639
small fruits as well so the adults for

738
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:48,480
this particular insect appear in June

739
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:51,479
the eggs hatch in July and the larv over

740
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,038
winter in the canes when the eggs are

741
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:58,000
laid there's a girdling that's about a/

742
00:33:54,038 --> 00:34:01,038
inch apart about 4 to 6 in below the

743
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,919
growth point on a cane this will result

744
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:07,440
in some pretty distinctive tip wilting

745
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,559
above these two girdle points the larvae

746
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,200
is then going to move down the cane as

747
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:15,838
it feeds toward the ground and that

748
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:15,838
entire cane will

749
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:20,720
die most of the biology studies for this

750
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,200
particular past are from the north and

751
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,439
they suggest that there's a 2-year life

752
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:25,918
cycle Don mentioned that there's a

753
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,599
2-year life cycle for the raspberry

754
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,199
Crown bore in the North and a one-year

755
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,639
life cycle for it in the South we lack a

756
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,799
lot of studies on this particular

757
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,320
species in the South so it may be a

758
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,440
similar situation that we have a shorter

759
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,599
life cycle here I mentioned the larv

760
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,320
move down the cane as they develop we'll

761
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,320
talk about some cultural control methods

762
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,599
for cane borers in general but for

763
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,679
raspberry cane bore it's particularly

764
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:52,679
important to prune below the damage keep

765
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,960
going on down that cane until you no

766
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,079
longer see tunneling in there when

767
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,760
you're removing them because if if you

768
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:01,440
don't you might not be removing the

769
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:04,320
insect and it'll continue to

770
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,639
develop the other can Bora that we have

771
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,480
and these are some slides that Don

772
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:12,078
graciously provided for me to use as

773
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,000
well is the rednecked canbor and this is

774
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,200
what we call a metallic wood boring

775
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,639
Beetle they don't have those lawn and

776
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:23,199
tenny on them and these are native to

777
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:24,838
Canada New England out west to Minnesota

778
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,078
and South to the Gulf States so again in

779
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:28,199
east of the Mississippi pest this is

780
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,519
what they look like you can see their

781
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:33,039
antenna are much shorter than the

782
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:33,039
raspberry

783
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,838
camore so the adults feed and mate on

784
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,519
the

785
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:43,759
leaves and they lay their eggs only in

786
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:45,880
the prime canes in the early summer the

787
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,520
larv then girdle the cane you can see a

788
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,519
feeding cell for the larvae right here

789
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:53,559
with some frass in

790
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:56,318
there the girdling produce Gall produces

791
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:58,920
Galls in Midsummer the larv over winter

792
00:35:56,318 --> 00:36:02,199
in the pit of the cane these Galls

793
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,280
actually will predispose these canes to

794
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:07,239
Greater degrees of winter injury because

795
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,680
you'll see some photos in the next set

796
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:11,159
of slides that actually show the canes

797
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:13,000
are kind of bunched out so they become

798
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:15,679
more susceptible to

799
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,880
damage there's some historic work all

800
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:20,519
the way back in the 30s that actually

801
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,318
listed some cultivars as perhaps having

802
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:26,039
some resistance to Redneck can bore of

803
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:28,800
course these are cultivars that were not

804
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:31,039
really growing much anymore so not a lot

805
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,400
about our currently grown cultivars is

806
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:35,000
know but it appears that at least

807
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,639
there's some resistance out there in the

808
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,599
germ plasm to this particular

809
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:43,039
pest there's really no known biological

810
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:46,440
control for either of our cane boring

811
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:48,519
beetles in in this particular system our

812
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,519
cultural control method is very similar

813
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:53,480
to the the cultural control method for

814
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,679
rasbury Crown boore during the winter as

815
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,679
Don mentioned if fewer than 5% of the

816
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:02,358
canes are gall prune off those G canes

817
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:04,358
and Destroy them it's very important

818
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:06,440
that you don't just pile up those canes

819
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:07,880
on the side of the planting and let them

820
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,920
sit there because the insects will

821
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,039
continue to develop in them and can

822
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,599
emerge out as adults and reinfest the

823
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:16,880
planting so they need to be burned

824
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,880
chipped removed off

825
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,719
site you can also cut off Prime Gaines

826
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
down to the soil

827
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:26,919
surface and that reduces that guling

828
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,440
pretty distinctively and Don has some

829
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,519
photos from a trial that was done in

830
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,358
Arkansas and this is I I mentioned what

831
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:35,039
that guling looks like and you can see

832
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:38,239
how it distends the cane there and can

833
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:41,400
result in some greater potential damage

834
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:45,000
so the logic for this trial was to avoid

835
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,039
Galls on primocanes after the egg Lane

836
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,159
was occurring in early

837
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:52,358
spring and pruning was done at several

838
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,799
different

839
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:56,119
dates and this photo was taken about in

840
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,680
the middle of this and you can see the

841
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:00,240
three different different plots that

842
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,838
were pruned out there and the go number

843
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,239
of Galls were then tracked and the

844
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:08,279
take-home message there is that after

845
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:12,159
that egg laying period was when the

846
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:15,160
lowest degree of Galls were

847
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,559
observed and you can uh we can talk with

848
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,199
Don a little bit more about any

849
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,960
additional questions you have about this

850
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:22,879
particular trial we're I'm glad that

851
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:26,559
he's sticking around for the rest of the

852
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,640
session so as we mentioned cultural

853
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:32,358
control if you have less than 5%

854
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:34,838
injury if there's greater than that

855
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:36,679
degree of injury and 5 to 10% is perhaps

856
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:38,679
a rule of thumb that is a rule of thumb

857
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:40,799
that we use a bit more in North

858
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:42,879
Carolina if there's greater injury

859
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,160
there's some also some pesticide options

860
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,559
that are available that would be used

861
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:49,440
during that egg laying time when the

862
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:52,078
adults are out and about the target

863
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,079
insect for treatment is the adults we're

864
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,839
not targeting the larv in this case

865
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,079
because they're going to be feeding

866
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:00,119
inside of the cane and difficult to get

867
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,760
a contact with an

868
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,720
insecticide so spray where the adults

869
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,440
are the lower part of the canes

870
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,719
especially in the primee since that's

871
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,720
where they're going to be laying their

872
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:14,118
eggs there are also there's a a label

873
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:15,799
for systemic insecticides use pre- Bloom

874
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,559
that type of treatment would be

875
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,720
targeting the larve and the cane and not

876
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:22,960
the

877
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:26,199
adults moving on to Strawberry Clipper

878
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,838
this is a weevil it's in the same genus

879
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:29,439
as the bull weevil so those of you who

880
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:32,639
might be more familiar with that it's in

881
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,000
the same group the adult is a small

882
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,318
Weevil this is the type of injury that's

883
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,480
attributable to Strawberry Clippers they

884
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:42,920
do exactly what their name suggests they

885
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,800
clip right below the bud what that is is

886
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:50,119
them laying an egg at that point and the

887
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:55,440
larv will then feed on the tip of that

888
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:59,000
bud so the threshold um or the number of

889
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,639
buds to sample is sampling 100 clusters

890
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,159
beginning after first Bloom these are

891
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,039
thresholds that were developed in

892
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,960
Arkansas and then when damage is

893
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:09,440
observed begin insecticide treatments

894
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,920
but I want to caution all of you be very

895
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:16,280
very careful with Bloom insecticide

896
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,680
treatments and this is just a link to

897
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,240
one of the North Carolina egg hem manual

898
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:23,639
sections on insecticides that have

899
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:27,679
varying degrees of B

900
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:30,279
toxicity so this is the sort of

901
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:33,078
thing to keep an eye out for if you run

902
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,079
into an issue where you expect to be

903
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:37,400
treating during Bloom for whatever type

904
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:38,839
of insect we try to avoid recommending

905
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,838
Bloom treatments unless they're

906
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:41,838
absolutely

907
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:45,920
necessary and I'll be interested to see

908
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:47,679
what people say in response to Laura's

909
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,318
question down there in the chat as to

910
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,639
whether or not anyone's seen damage in

911
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:54,079
New

912
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:56,799
York moving on to

913
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,880
spiderm because we primar L grow

914
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,599
blackberries in North Carolina they're

915
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,599
usually a secondary pest for us we see

916
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,760
them in

917
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,280
the fall on primocane

918
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,240
leaves however there are much more

919
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,640
serious pest in raspberries and I will

920
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:13,799
show I'll show you some photos that

921
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,639
illustrate that from the Pacific

922
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,200
Northwest and that's where the most work

923
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:20,559
has been done on spidermites and

924
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:23,199
caneberries so these are images of two-

925
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,920
spotted spidermites tetrus ER is the the

926
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,960
scientific name and this is an adult

927
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,480
female you can tell that it's a female

928
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,599
by her rounded abdomen versus the male

929
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,358
here who has a pointed abdomen these are

930
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,720
some eggs they're perfectly spherical

931
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,400
they almost look like little perfectly

932
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,838
round grains of sand these can be pretty

933
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,079
easily observed with a handheld hand

934
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,639
lens 10x or greater would be my

935
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,318
recommendation these are images from the

936
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:53,519
ucim web page it's just

937
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:55,239
www.uc or IPM davis.edu and I'll type

938
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,239
that down in the

939
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:58,239
Box

940
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,399
one of the challenging things with using

941
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,640
the internet is your IPM tool is that

942
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,599
there's going to be things that are

943
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:11,639
different from region to region and the

944
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,760
IPM website at UC Davis is an excellent

945
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:15,318
resource for images I wouldn't

946
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,400
necessarily use it as a source for Pest

947
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:19,440
Management because as a west of the

948
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,160
Mississippi Source it's going to have

949
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,440
some very different recommendations than

950
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:24,719
we would

951
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,240
have spider might's diapause in the

952
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,159
winter and a diapause ing spidermite

953
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:31,558
looks like this they're kind of salmony

954
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,719
orange color and these food spots will

955
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:36,280
go away as they're diapausing because

956
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:38,799
diapause means they're not eating and

957
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,800
they're not

958
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:42,800
reproducing spidermites could be flared

959
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,519
by the use of broads Spectrum

960
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,119
insecticides and caneberries this is

961
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:47,880
where we tend to see most of a problem

962
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:49,920
in the Southeast is if people are using

963
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,200
broads Spectrum insecticides they can

964
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,559
create a spidermite problem where there

965
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:56,919
may not have been one before there are

966
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:59,200
very good might specific contr control

967
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,960
options that should be used instead of

968
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,919
broadspectrum

969
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,000
insecticides there's no developed

970
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,440
threshold or scouting program for mites

971
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,599
and caneberries but a suggested scouting

972
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,800
plan for those of you that might be

973
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:13,039
concerned about them would be to sample

974
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,960
at least 10 leaflets per Acer count the

975
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:17,119
number of mites present and treat when

976
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,838
there are visual Leaf symptoms and this

977
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,119
is what I mentioned about raspberries

978
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:22,119
being far more susceptible to

979
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:24,039
spidermites then blackberries will these

980
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:26,240
are this is an uninfested Leaf this is

981
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:27,880
an infested Leaf in raspberries and

982
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:29,118
apologize for the picture quality here

983
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,920
but these are plants that have been

984
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,800
essentially defoliated by spiderm

985
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,039
feeding and I mentioned that there are

986
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,160
primarily there have been primarily

987
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:39,679
worked upon in the Pacific Northwest in

988
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:41,078
addition to the two- spotted spidermite

989
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,440
which is shown here they also have two

990
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:44,640
other spidermites that they've recorded

991
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,559
from canberries the yellow spidermite

992
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,078
and the McDonald spidermite so those are

993
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,200
also out there they're going to differ a

994
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,200
little bit in appearance but they

995
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:54,879
management and feeding Behavior will be

996
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:54,879
essentially the

997
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:00,000
same

998
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,760
when we talk about those two of those 3M

999
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,280
of IPM minimizing and managing the most

1000
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,400
important thing to do for spider mites

1001
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,359
is to select the right pesticide when

1002
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,920
mites are present particularly in

1003
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:12,239
blackberries because they don't appear

1004
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,639
to be as much of a concern from the

1005
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,959
defoliation standpoint as they are in

1006
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,039
raspberries so select a material that's

1007
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,838
not going to flare spidermites

1008
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:25,400
minimizing Road dust can also contribute

1009
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:27,318
to reducing spidermite populations

1010
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,240
because they have out on the undersides

1011
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:31,759
of leaves dust can adhere to the webbing

1012
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,719
that they create hence their Nam

1013
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,200
spidermites and create these refugia

1014
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,000
that they can hide in so dust can

1015
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,439
exacerbate problems there are also

1016
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,639
native and introduced biocontrol methods

1017
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,480
that are available this is just some of

1018
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,440
the commercially available predatory

1019
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,679
mites phyto cilus pmus neilus cnicus

1020
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,280
galendromus oxident Talis in addition to

1021
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,440
many other predatory mites that are

1022
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,680
available some of these may already

1023
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,119
occur in regions or they can be

1024
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,279
purchased and augmented if they're

1025
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:03,200
already there see if they're doing the

1026
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,599
job for you and finally use might

1027
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:08,519
specific tools to control them so use

1028
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:11,440
MDES to treat populations rather than

1029
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:11,440
using broadspectrum

1030
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,118
insecticides moving on to thrips we've

1031
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,280
been looking at thrips in my lab in

1032
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,079
blackberries for two years now and we're

1033
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,200
going we're getting ready to rule into a

1034
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,519
third year and the reason why we're

1035
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:26,318
looking at them is because there's been

1036
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,358
grower concern about fruit injury and

1037
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:31,039
potential pollination impacts they're

1038
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:32,558
also a potential contamination pest this

1039
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:34,039
is a box of blackberries that I bought

1040
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,040
at the grocery store this summer and I'm

1041
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:37,880
not going to say where they were from as

1042
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:39,960
I was sitting driving in my car the way

1043
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,920
home I noticed that thrips were crawling

1044
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,280
out of the box so I had to make my

1045
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,318
significant other take a detour to the

1046
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,480
lab so I could take a picture of uh of

1047
00:45:45,318 --> 00:45:47,759
the thrips that were coming out of these

1048
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,440
blackberries that I just purchased at

1049
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,720
the gr grocery store so they are a

1050
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,000
potential contamination

1051
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:55,159
pest uh the objectives of This research

1052
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,519
were to figure out because we

1053
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:00,000
essentially knew not nothing about the

1054
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:01,519
thrips that were here um the diversity

1055
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,800
and the seasonal biology of what was

1056
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,079
present and if they were actually

1057
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,680
causing a problem if so what management

1058
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:09,000
strategies could we

1059
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:11,159
use so what we found is that thrips are

1060
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,880
present in both flowers and foliage in

1061
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:15,279
much higher numbers in the in the

1062
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,160
flowers however and the plant samples

1063
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,079
Peak during

1064
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:23,480
Bloom you can see in the dark orange

1065
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:25,200
line and the open Square line here those

1066
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:28,480
are our larvel thrips and our adult

1067
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:31,439
thrips in samples those samples Peak off

1068
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,039
the plant in

1069
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,318
bloom

1070
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:41,079
however our trap captures continue to

1071
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:43,558
increase even though our plant samples

1072
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:45,960
decrease so our trap captures although

1073
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:48,040
pretty decent at tracking our plant

1074
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,519
samples early in the season just keep

1075
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:50,759
going up because they continue to move

1076
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:52,440
around but they're not present on the

1077
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:56,079
plants in the same

1078
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,800
way the traps that we're using are these

1079
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,800
two commercially available traps this is

1080
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,039
a yellow am trap and a blue card trap

1081
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,559
both of these are available from Great

1082
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:06,960
Lakes IPM and Laura gave you the link

1083
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,839
earlier in the chat and these are some

1084
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,920
homemade traps that we use because they

1085
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:12,920
allow us to identify to species the

1086
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,119
thrips that we're catching on them so

1087
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,039
they're the same color as the two other

1088
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,559
traps that we're using but we use them

1089
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:20,358
because they're a little a nicer

1090
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,400
research tool but commercially these are

1091
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:24,838
the types of traps that would be out

1092
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,760
there and I'll go back to that slide for

1093
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:28,799
a second just to illustrate numerically

1094
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,480
we tend to catch more thrips in the blue

1095
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,400
traps but the results between the two

1096
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,159
years have been a little conflicting we

1097
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:39,440
got significantly more thrips in our

1098
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:41,078
blue traps in 2008 and in 2009 we didn't

1099
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,079
see significant differences except for

1100
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:45,079
one date between our blue traps and our

1101
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,440
yellow traps the reason why we use

1102
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:47,880
different colors is because different

1103
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,440
species of thrips are attracted to

1104
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,559
different colors so we wanted to make

1105
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,000
sure that we were catching what was out

1106
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,880
there as I mentioned our Blossom samples

1107
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,880
have a much higher density our foliage

1108
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,480
samples have some thrips out there but

1109
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,880
they have a much higher diversity and

1110
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,480
that's just illustrated by these two

1111
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,440
figures our Blossom sample over here and

1112
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,679
our foliage sample over here lots of

1113
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:11,440
different species showing up here really

1114
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:13,480
only one species here which are Eastern

1115
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,000
flower

1116
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:18,039
thrips we've been looking at insecticide

1117
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,239
efficacy for these for this particular

1118
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:22,400
group of insects as well and I'll just

1119
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:24,000
give you the cliffnotes version of that

1120
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,280
we can reduce strips numbers with

1121
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,039
pesticides but this reduction hasn't

1122
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,880
corresponded with an increase in fruit

1123
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:33,599
size an increase in drupelet number or

1124
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,559
an increase in

1125
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:40,400
uh better shaped fruit and I'll show you

1126
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:42,599
some some data on that um fruit set was

1127
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,079
not assess assessed in these

1128
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:48,359
trials but we did a small scale caging

1129
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:50,440
trial in 2009 to see if we could force

1130
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:52,358
damage from these insects and

1131
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:56,318
blackberries this was done in Kinston

1132
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:57,759
North Carolina we caged buds or flowers

1133
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:59,798
either mature buds that were going to be

1134
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,599
flowers in a matter of a day or so or

1135
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:08,639
open flowers with different densities of

1136
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:10,960
thrips with 0o 5 10 and 20

1137
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:13,519
thrips and then we assessed fruit set

1138
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,960
size shape drupelets white drupelets

1139
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,239
because we folks were concerned that

1140
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,400
white drupelets may also be related to

1141
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:21,358
this there are some limitations this

1142
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,000
trial that I'll be completely upfront

1143
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,358
about we didn't look at survivorship of

1144
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,960
the thrip so we didn't go back and make

1145
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:28,000
sure they made it through the week that

1146
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,519
they were caged on there we used Western

1147
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,119
Flower thrips because that's what we had

1148
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,639
in a colony and we also there might have

1149
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:35,798
been some potential effects to caging

1150
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:39,000
although I don't think so

1151
00:49:35,798 --> 00:49:40,920
however at those densities we saw no

1152
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,079
difference in the number of fruit that

1153
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,760
were set so this is 90% fruit set in

1154
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,519
almost all of our cages we saw no

1155
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,960
difference in Fruit volume again none of

1156
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,920
these are significantly different from

1157
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,159
each

1158
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,159
other and we saw no difference in the

1159
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:56,558
number of

1160
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:58,558
drupelets so our our take-home message

1161
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,720
there is we've been doing a lot of work

1162
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,400
with thrips but we don't think based on

1163
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:05,078
this evidence and the fact that we seen

1164
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,639
no correlation in our insecticide trials

1165
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:09,960
between reducing thrips and having

1166
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:11,838
increased fruit quality that we actually

1167
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,798
have something that's causing damage to

1168
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:16,400
the fruit so instead we're shifting our

1169
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:19,159
Focus to looking at them as potential

1170
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:22,760
virus factors the thrips that are in red

1171
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:24,759
boxes on these two pie charts are known

1172
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,359
vectors of viruses that can be found in

1173
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,160
blackberries we're also as part of a

1174
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:31,400
greater group that Don is involved in

1175
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:34,480
and that one of our attendees here Danny

1176
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,318
um Liddell is also involved in we're

1177
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,599
looking at other potential virus factors

1178
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:40,599
in caneberries including Leaf Hoppers

1179
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:42,599
white flies and

1180
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:44,039
aphids and this is just an illustration

1181
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:46,798
of some of the leaf Hoppers that we find

1182
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:49,079
in our traps these are a leafhopper

1183
00:50:46,798 --> 00:50:51,960
species called graphos veruda that's a

1184
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:54,440
known pathogen Vector in other simp in

1185
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,358
other systems especially

1186
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:00,440
grape so just to briefly touch on some

1187
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:02,358
of my other um interests here uh to talk

1188
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,760
about some potential caneberry pests the

1189
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:06,000
first one I want to briefly mention is

1190
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,799
the light brown Apple moth this is the

1191
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,838
region in California where this

1192
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:13,880
particular invasive pest is currently

1193
00:51:10,838 --> 00:51:17,358
located at and is under quarantine

1194
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:21,119
for the light brown Apple moth is a leaf

1195
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:23,039
roller and it does pretty much the same

1196
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,838
thing as many other native Leaf rollers

1197
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:28,199
that we have here these are photos off

1198
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:30,078
of Mark bould's blog I gave you all the

1199
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:31,960
link in the notes page and I encourage

1200
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,359
you to take a look at that Mark bolda is

1201
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,240
a farm adviser in Santa Cruz County

1202
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:38,679
California one of the areas where they

1203
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:41,519
grow a lot of their their cane berries

1204
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:43,239
and here's some potential damage the

1205
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,280
light brown Apple moth can cause to cane

1206
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:47,959
berries the actual um feeding of the

1207
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,119
insect on the leaves is not as much of a

1208
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,358
concern but they'll tunnel up and build

1209
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:53,798
these silken cases for themselves and

1210
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:57,159
that can be a contamination issue and

1211
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:59,798
this is what the larvae looks like

1212
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:02,798
I don't anticipate that libron Apple

1213
00:51:59,798 --> 00:52:04,639
moth is going to be a game Cher in terms

1214
00:52:02,798 --> 00:52:06,400
of management for us but it is a

1215
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:10,759
quarantine Pest and that can raise

1216
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:15,880
issues for export and import from areas

1217
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:18,359
So that's its primary role as as as a

1218
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:20,119
issue in terms of being an invasive pest

1219
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:21,960
but it has yet to have spread widely

1220
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:24,480
Beyond California there are active

1221
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,720
trapping programs in the Southeast and

1222
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,119
if this is something you're concerned

1223
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:29,239
about definitely talk with Cooperative

1224
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,640
Extension agents in your

1225
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:33,798
area the next insect which may

1226
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:36,798
potentially be more important than

1227
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:39,159
libron Apple moth is a spotted wopa this

1228
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:41,039
is a male spotted wopa you can see right

1229
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:44,399
there how it gets its names it has two

1230
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:46,719
spots one on each Wing this is a female

1231
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,200
spotted wi dropa and this is a closeup

1232
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:52,118
of what makes them interesting in terms

1233
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:54,558
of Pest Management she has a serrated

1234
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:58,960
knife likee ovap posit or egg laye

1235
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:01,359
device that she uses to infest sound

1236
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,880
fruit this is what makes this particular

1237
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:05,838
fly so different from other dropa

1238
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,358
species which we're primarily familiar

1239
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:09,318
with as being the little flies that get

1240
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:13,000
on our bananas if we let them get over

1241
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:14,798
ripe in our house these guys like sound

1242
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,920
fruit out in the field and this is a

1243
00:53:14,798 --> 00:53:19,318
larvae feeding in a

1244
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,760
cherry what's particularly troubling

1245
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:24,159
about them is that they've spread

1246
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:27,480
rapidly since their initial detection in

1247
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:30,000
2008 in some backyard cherries in

1248
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,760
California up and down the West Coast so

1249
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,400
they're now found at many locations in

1250
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,920
California many locations in Oregon some

1251
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,200
spots in Washington and they've been

1252
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,079
detected in

1253
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:43,639
Florida so that spread itself has been

1254
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:45,920
pretty rapid that being said they don't

1255
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:47,440
like cold weather that much so I'm

1256
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,880
really interested to see what's going to

1257
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,519
happen after this winter I anticipate

1258
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,280
that if we have decent overwintering

1259
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:58,119
populations in California which we do

1260
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,839
that that spread is just as likely to

1261
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:02,480
occur again even if the harsh winter

1262
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:05,719
conditions in Florida and on the East

1263
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,199
Coast have knock down those populations

1264
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:10,480
there as I mentioned the larv feed on

1265
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:11,879
sound soft skin fruit they're probably

1266
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,400
not going to be an issue for citrus

1267
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,079
production it's just too thick for them

1268
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,838
to get through but for things like

1269
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:19,039
caneberries they're particularly

1270
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:21,318
problematic Mark bolda again in

1271
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:22,960
California has some really nice posts on

1272
00:54:21,318 --> 00:54:25,318
this particular insect so if you want

1273
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,000
more details on management tools that

1274
00:54:25,318 --> 00:54:28,880
they're working out that's an excellent

1275
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,639
resource to check out they have a very

1276
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,200
short generation time that means they

1277
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:36,199
can have lots and lots of generations in

1278
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:38,919
a ripening caneberry plot females lay

1279
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:40,358
lots of eggs and I mentioned um there's

1280
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,240
a high mortality at freezing

1281
00:54:40,358 --> 00:54:43,759
temperatures so it's possible that this

1282
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:45,239
winter was a little hard on them

1283
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,680
particularly on those East Coast

1284
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:49,679
populations which would be encouraging I

1285
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:52,519
have on here that the males are sterile

1286
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:54,000
at greater than 86° fah I don't want

1287
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:55,838
that to be too comforting to folks

1288
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
because folks in the Southeast see that

1289
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,199
and we think okay well we're not going

1290
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,119
to have to worry about them as much but

1291
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:03,239
there's pretty much

1292
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,960
somewhere during the summer where the

1293
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:06,919
insects could hide out and find

1294
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,639
temperatures that are below 86 degrees

1295
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:11,358
even on really hot days so I don't know

1296
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,118
if that's necessarily going to be a

1297
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:15,279
gamebreaker again I mentioned Mark

1298
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,838
bold's blog is an excellent resource for

1299
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,440
information on this particular pest

1300
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:20,480
we're developing an early detection

1301
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,039
monitoring Network in the Midsouth

1302
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,400
specifically in North Carolina South

1303
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:26,119
Carolina and Virginia we're going to be

1304
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,000
we're going to be training people in

1305
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:29,318
March and there's a lot more info on

1306
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,559
that on my

1307
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:32,798
blog finally I'll just talk a little bit

1308
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,319
about stink

1309
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:38,559
bugs the stink bug work has been done by

1310
00:55:35,318 --> 00:55:42,400
Don uh Doug feifer and Laura Maxi at a

1311
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:44,119
un at Virginia Tech and there's a number

1312
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,079
of different species of stink bugs that

1313
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:48,400
can be present in caneberries

1314
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:51,960
particularly in the Southeast the fruit

1315
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,519
damage that they're causing however is

1316
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,838
unclear there's no threshold or scouting

1317
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:57,480
procedures for them and only

1318
00:55:55,838 --> 00:56:00,719
broadspectrum insecticides are

1319
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,719
registered and therefore

1320
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:04,159
recommended what Laura's been working on

1321
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,520
is actually looking at the feeding

1322
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:08,558
behavior of stink bugs and seeing what

1323
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:10,679
type of damage they might actually be

1324
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,640
causing what she's observed them doing

1325
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:17,118
is feeding on veins of leaves seil on

1326
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:18,960
developing fruit and then this is some

1327
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,640
of the injury associated with stinkbug

1328
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,318
she's been seeing on fruit she's been

1329
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:25,960
seeing this type of injury to individual

1330
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:29,679
drupelets and this is actually doe to

1331
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:31,920
feeding by the bug between the drupelets

1332
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:34,118
not on the individual drupelets

1333
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,798
themselves and I'll mention that again

1334
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:37,720
as we flip through to the video at the

1335
00:56:35,798 --> 00:56:39,599
very end this is the other type of

1336
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:41,798
damage we're concerned about stinkbugs

1337
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:45,559
are potential

1338
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:47,239
contamination uh nuisance as well as we

1339
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:50,480
all know they're Nam stink bugs for a

1340
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:53,479
reason and you can actually smell and

1341
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:56,318
taste when stink bugs release their

1342
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:58,000
odorous compounds on and around

1343
00:56:56,318 --> 00:57:00,279
caneberries so there are contamination

1344
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,318
concern because of

1345
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:06,400
that this is the video I mentioned um

1346
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:08,119
this is saved as a file that you can

1347
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,480
download in the file sharing section I

1348
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:12,519
encourage all of you to do it do that

1349
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,358
what what it actually shows is the

1350
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:17,719
stylet of this green stink bug here

1351
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:19,798
going between the

1352
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:22,558
drupelets and

1353
00:57:19,798 --> 00:57:25,519
feeding so unlike what we thought just

1354
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:28,160
thinking beforehand before Laura did

1355
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:29,838
this work we were assuming that the stin

1356
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:31,519
bugs were probably feeding on these

1357
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:33,639
individual drupelets and potentially

1358
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:36,119
causing them to be leaky causing them to

1359
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:37,519
turn white causing damage to them but

1360
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,000
that hasn't been what they've observed

1361
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:41,519
what they've observed is actually

1362
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,239
feeding between them that may damage the

1363
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:46,280
drupelets surrounding that feeding

1364
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:48,598
puncture because of damage to the the

1365
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:51,280
recepticle underneath but not

1366
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:54,000
necessarily individual duplet

1367
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,119
feeding and I think that's my last slide

1368
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,280
so with that I'll encourage you all to

1369
00:57:56,119 --> 00:58:00,680
download that file from um from the file

1370
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,760
sharing section and I'm sorry we

1371
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:04,838
couldn't play it for you and I'll take

1372
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,839
any questions that you

1373
00:58:04,838 --> 00:58:11,078
have I'm going to move us into that file

1374
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:14,679
sharing so that people can um download

1375
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:16,400
this one it's the greens by yellow rasp

1376
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:20,519
um right there that's the file that you

1377
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:23,880
can upload and I will also post both PDF

1386
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:54,240
sure that was a lot of great information

1387

and I also want to um comment that it

1388
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:59,798
really is uh it's really interesting for

1389
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:01,879
me as an extension person to watch uh in

1390
00:58:59,798 --> 00:59:04,719
other areas where some of these pest the

1391
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:07,000
different pest problems because uh it's

1392
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:10,719
been alarming to me I've I've worked in

1393
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,119
extension for uh 20 years or so and just

1394
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,759
the change and the diseases and insects

1395
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,760
that we see that we thought we would not

1396
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:20,799
see in our area we are seeing now and

1397
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,640
this is a nice opportunity for us to get

1398
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:26,639
a little heads up about what might be

1399
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:26,639
coming our our way

1400
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:32,798
