00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:03,479
from Penn State joining us UMass

19
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,799
uh people from New York state so we got

20
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:09,359
a good collection of people joining us

21
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:13,400
today uh and if you look to the lower

22

left you'll see a series of web links uh

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,799
one is the soil nutrient management

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,960
webinar so that's where you'll find a

25
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,799
lot of information about what's being

26

present today and in future

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:30,200
events and uh below it is uh publication

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,280
building soils for better crops and then

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,079
I'll direct you to the far

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,920
right where there's a file box and if

31
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:41,279
you haven't joined us before this is a

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,640
second meeting uh if you would uh

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,079
download the

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,640
demographics and the educator

35
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:53,319
pretests uh at your leisure you can do

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,439
that after this program today and if you

37
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,839
would fill them out and then send them

38
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,879
into Kathy Heiden Rick and she's her

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,719
addresses on those PC

40
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,879
and send them into her that would be

41
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,280
very helpful to fulfill our requirements

42
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,598
for the

43
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,800
grant and we're going to take questions

44
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,919
throughout the program um but we're

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:19,400
going to answer the questions at the

46
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:24,598
end so with that I'm going to switch

47
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,599
over and introduce our speaker for today

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,439
speaker is Harold vaness he's professor

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,360
of Soil and Water Management chair of

50
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,598
the Department of crop and soil Sciences

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,800
at Cornell

52
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,679
University his current research and

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,599
extension interests are in Precision

54
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,959
management of nitrogen soil health and

55
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:49,039
SpaceTime

56
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,560
statistics Harold teaches an undergrad

57
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,639
undergrad course in soil management for

58
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,519
sustainability and a grad course in

59
00:02:53,639 --> 00:03:00,000
space time statistics he's going to talk

60
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:03,439
to us today about soil types accessing

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,400
soil surveys and soil physical chemical

62
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,239
and biological

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,879
properties and with that I'm going to

64
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,878
turn over to

65
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,560
Harold good day everyone I hope you can

66
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:18,080
hear

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,519
me um it's beautiful day here in itha

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,840
and um I see a lot of familiar names

69
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,360
here on the participant list so I say hi

70
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,439
to all of you it's uh it's a it's a

71
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,319
pleasure to be able to present this uh

72
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,280
through this format so today

73
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,919
um this will be more of an

74
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,519
introductory uh webinar as it relates to

75
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:41,438
to Berry production and in the more

76
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,640
subsequent webinars we're going to be

77
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:45,759
talking more about uh sort of management

78
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,878
approaches so today will be a little bit

79
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,199
more

80
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,359
conceptual and uh and we'll talk more

81
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,598
about the about the

82
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,920
principles uh so quick outline for today

83
00:03:54,598 --> 00:04:00,479
uh we'll start out with uh discussion on

84
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:03,479
seral health Concepts we'll this discuss

85
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,039
uh the concept of inherent soil quality

86
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,719
and the use of soil survey

87
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:12,158
information and then we'll discuss each

88
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:14,560
of the the three Realms of soil Health

89
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:17,000
the chemical uh characteristics and

90
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,918
measurements the physical and then the

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,519
biological and and with the biological

92
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,839
we'll also talk um quite a bit about the

93
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,120
role of organic matter which is an key

94
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,719
component and then towards the end I'll

95
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,280
I'll just have a few slides About

96
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,560
Management considerations for for Berry

97
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,478
production basically as an introduction

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,839
to uh to the subsequent

99
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:40,639
webinars um so many of you I think are

100
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:43,478
probably familiar with this concept but

101
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,160
you know I'd like to uh refer to Cal

102
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:47,839
Health as the capacity of the serl to

103
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,639
function and you can think of a much

104
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:53,799
larger definition but it's all about you

105
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,280
know how the C functions uh we're all

106
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,360
familiar with the concept of human

107
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,559
health and and uh how we as humans

108
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,919
function and similar we think about uh

109
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,079
soils functioning in the context of of

110
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,959
uh this discussion of course the primary

111
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:14,519
function is for that soil is to to

112
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:18,120
produce a a good uh crop uh both uh high

113
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:18,120
quality and high high

114
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,439
quantities so what uh what are

115
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,599
characteristics of of a healthy soil and

116
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:27,439
in the same way we think of of a healthy

117
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,199
human being as as having um you know

118
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:34,439
blood pressure in a certain range 80

119
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,280
over you know 120 over 80 uh heartbeat

120
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,560
at a certain rate a cholesterol level at

121
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:42,038
a certain rate um so in terms of healthy

122
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,000
CS we can think of of all all of these

123
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:47,120
and this is certainly not an exhaus

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,478
exhaustive list so sufficient amount of

125
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,439
nutrients but not excess uh because that

126
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:53,918
can create problems environmentally or

127
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:57,038
or agronomically as well in some cases

128
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:59,639
good tail sufficient depth for good

129
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,038
rooting good water storage and and

130
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:06,000
drainage to get it through Dry and wet

131
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:08,038
periods free of harmful chemicals low

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,079
populations of plant disease and

133
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:14,199
parasitic organisms and uh Vice uh vice

134
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:17,439
versa higher populations of beneficial

135
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:20,080
organisms low wheat pressure resistance

136
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,478
to being degraded to say through

137
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,758
compaction or erosion and and a

138
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,959
resilient soil that that recovers

139
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,199
quickly from Adverse Events like uh like

140
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,439
excess water or hurricane or something

141
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,439
like

142
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:38,199
that so what's uh what's important to

143
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,959
sort of understand is is is our soal

144
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:44,080
health philosophy uh that we um that we

145
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,758
think in terms of the the three major

146
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,680
Realms the physical the chemical and and

147
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,160
the biological and and and the whole

148
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,759
point is that a healthy soil is is

149
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,520
balanced in in that respect and and

150
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,960
therefore provides for good growing

151
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,159
conditions and resiliency and and also

152
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:04,878
reduced

153
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,919
inputs um in general over the past uh

154
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,360
decades we've we've tended to

155
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:12,318
overemphasize the the chemical aspect of

156
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,280
the soil we've uh um and and and and not

157
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,479
to a fault necessarily but um we've

158
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,198
developed good testing procedures I

159
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:22,598
think most farmers and Growers know how

160
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:25,160
to how to use and manage the the

161
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:27,079
chemistry of the soil the the physical

162
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,199
aspects and especially the biological

163
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,719
aspect we haven't really paid nearly as

164
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,439
much attention to and yet these are also

165
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,080
very important component of of the

166
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,279
functioning of the soil so uh during

167
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,719
this uh this webinar I'm going to pay a

168
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:41,878
little bit more attention to the

169
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,440
physical and the biological

170
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,360
components so when we think in terms of

171
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,800
um the functioning of the soil we can

172
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,560
sort of parse that down to uh processes

173
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,598
so on this slide we uh we have the the

174
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,879
three Realms physical biological and

175
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:00,878
chemical and and to the site there you

176
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,120
see the different processes that are

177
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,879
critical for a soil to function well for

178
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,879
example uh physical support is is a

179
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,158
physical uh function irration is a

180
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,360
physical process water storage and

181
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:17,399
movement resistance to erosion root

182
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,080
proliferation and organism movement

183
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:23,758
those are all physical uh processes uh

184
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:26,878
that um that are affected by things like

185
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,598
compaction and um and aggregate

186
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,280
stability on the chemical realm the one

187
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,439
we're typically a little bit more

188
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,038
familiar with nutrient storage and

189
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,560
release soil reaction which relates

190
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:41,000
mostly to pH carbon storage and energy

191
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,639
which is the the important role of

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,120
organic matter that we'll discuss later

193
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:48,519
and then we have all those important

194
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,720
biological functions suppressing pests

195
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,799
and vice versa having beneficial

196
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,959
organisms nitrogen

197
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,199
mineralization organic matter

198
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,278
decomposition and uh supporting

199
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,278
microbial communities so we have these

200
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:03,958
these three Realms they do interact and

201
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,679
we'll we'll talk about that a little bit

202
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:08,599
later and uh but it's important that we

203
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:11,759
think in terms of the processes because

204
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,879
if any of these processes is compromised

205
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,360
for example if you have poor Iration and

206
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,838
there's a lot of lot of problems that

207
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,959
result from that for example more uh

208
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:24,040
more disease problems uh uh nutrient

209
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,799
deficiencies and and all those kind of

210
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:27,399
things so it's important that we think

211
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,519
in terms of

212
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,759
processes another concept that we need

213
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,000
to keep in mind is uh is that of

214
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:37,399
inherent versus Dynamic soil quality and

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,799
that not all soils are are the same that

216
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,639
way what do we mean with inherent soil

217
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:46,559
quality it's basically uh the idea that

218
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:49,600
soils are created differently that um uh

219
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,278
some soils are uh you know Sandy others

220
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,680
are maybe silt looms and yet others are

221
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:58,078
clay loms and this is really the result

222
00:09:54,679 --> 00:10:01,719
of all these uh kind of natural genetic

223
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:04,159
C forming processes uh some CS are

224
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,680
naturally well- drained others are not

225
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,679
some are naturally high in organic

226
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:12,919
matter other are not so uh this is uh

227
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:14,799
sort of the the the basic soil quality

228
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:18,278
that is often also represented in the

229
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:20,599
soil survey information the dynamic soil

230
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:24,320
quality on the other hand relates more

231
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,720
to how uh how do soil uh has developed

232
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,040
as a result of management and we can

233
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,399
think of that in terms of both negative

234
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:34,559
and and positive directions so a a very

235
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,240
uh high quality soil may become very

236
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:40,399
degraded due to erosion or compaction or

237
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,560
a lot of intensive tillage over over

238
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:46,799
many years and so it may become a less

239
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:48,439
desirable and less well functioning soil

240
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,439
uh on the other hand you can improve a

241
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,360
soil as well you can take a soil that's

242
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,720
uh let say low in organic matter content

243
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,039
and over a period of five or six years

244
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,560
you can build that up to become a much

245
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,759
more high quality soil

246
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:05,319
when we when we talk about soal health

247
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:08,159
we primarily refer to this Dynamic soal

248
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,240
quality so uh that the part of the sore

249
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,519
quality that we can influence by

250
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,560
management the other component the

251
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,120
inherent sore quality is more more or

252
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,799
less a given you know you can't

253
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,200
necessarily change

254
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:23,679
that so uh again the inherent s quality

255
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,160
the results of some of these long-term

256
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:30,078
geologic biotic climatic and topographic

257
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:32,759
factors so this uh blue blueberry uh

258
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:35,958
field here is located in kind of a

259
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:39,720
valley environment with certain soil

260
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:42,199
types maybe grally or sandy soil as you

261
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,480
often find in the Northeast uh but the

262
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,440
soil say on this Hillside would be would

263
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,519
be very different they would have uh

264
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,120
quite different depth different organic

265
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:54,000
matter content different drainage uh

266
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,320
more susceptible to erosion Etc so

267
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,679
typically the the the first thing that

268
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,278
you want to do is is select a site that

269
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,519
has favorable soil conditions and you

270
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:06,838
can do that by using soil survey

271
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,000
information um the site selection I

272
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,079
would say is is is critical to

273
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,639
successful Berry management if you start

274
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:16,599
out with a soil that's inherently of low

275
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,799
quality you're just basically have an

276
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,839
uphill battle it's it's difficult to

277
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:25,198
overcome a lot of those

278
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,639
constraints um so what are some of those

279
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:30,359
inherent primary properties and I think

280
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,759
most of you are familiar with that uh in

281
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,600
terms of the physical ones Cal texture

282
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:39,078
of course is very uh very critical

283
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,120
whether you have a sand salt clay um or

284
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:44,000
anything in in between whether you have

285
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,799
a lot of stones and that uh that often

286
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,120
sort of sets the you know a lot of the

287
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,319
other important Cal

288
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,799
properties uh whether you have a problem

289
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,480
with internal drainage or not uh you can

290
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,838
modify that if you have a drainage

291
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,199
problem then you probably want to

292
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,120
install some drainage uh the depth of

293
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:03,319
the soil or presence of barriers for

294
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,839
example a

295
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,959
fragipan um that can sometimes be

296
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:12,519
modified but maybe a a major constraint

297
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:15,638
and then slope can also be an issue in

298
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,320
terms of the chemistry we have uh and

299
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,879
we'll come back to that we have a number

300
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,639
of nutrients that we're concerned about

301
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:25,278
pH is very important and even though a

302
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,320
lot of these can be corrected and and

303
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,559
modified um it's typically uh you know

304
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,639
if you start out with a soil for example

305
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,399
that's very

306
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,639
acidic it's uh it's often difficult to

307
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,958
overcome but another important point to

308
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,480
make of course is that especially with

309
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:43,039
berry production that that's that

310
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,759
certain uh crops favor a lower pH like

311
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,399
blueberries and others uh do not and so

312
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,480
uh that's all something that you have to

313
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,480
keep in mind salt accumulation is is not

314
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,839
as much of a concern here in in the

315
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,320
Northeast but in other parts of the

316
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,399
country or the world uh that can be a

317
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,639
major constraint very difficult to to

318
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,559
overcome and then we have a number of of

319
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,799
course biological components and

320
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,559
typically in terms of the the basic

321
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,719
primary properties that is expressed

322
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:13,719
through the the organic matter content

323
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,879
in the soil if you have higher organic

324
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:20,278
matter levels typically that soil is

325
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:24,759
healthier can support a lot uh more

326
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:27,399
diverse and uh and intensive biological

327
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,440
processes and we'll talk about that in a

328
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,600
few minutes

329
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,079
so much of that basic information on

330
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,839
these primary properties can be gathered

331
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:40,799
from s survey reports um this is um

332
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,079
selection of s surveys from the state of

333
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:46,679
New York uh some of them are are quite

334
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:49,039
old uh the early ones are from the 1930s

335
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,758
and then the most recent ones are from

336
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:55,480
the 1990s I think maybe even from uh

337
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,839
from uh Century um they provide you with

338
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,399
all that uh basic information about

339
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,480
texture pH available water capacity Etc

340
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,958
it tells you uh whether what the

341
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,680
suitability for use of Any of of those

342
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:11,119
soils is uh is it is it good Farmland uh

343
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,359
what are some of the constraints for

344
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,919
example uh but keep in mind that with

345
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,959
Insight variability may be a factor

346
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:21,879
these soils have been mapped uh by soil

347
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,239
surveyors but uh typically the the level

348
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:27,480
of detail that's uh that needs to be

349
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,720
considered for say the establishment of

350
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,560
an of an orchard or or or a berry

351
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,759
production field uh is is not quite

352
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:39,000
sufficient but it's a it's a very good

353
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,879
early start these Publications um are

354
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,278
available from extension offices for

355
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,360
from Soil and Water Conservation

356
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:48,360
District offices and uh natural

357
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,680
resources conservation districts and uh

358
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,800
and several other places often libraries

359
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:54,318
have them as

360
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:56,639
well uh but I wanted to point out that a

361
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:59,159
lot of this information now is available

362
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,360
also through the web uh through the

363
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:03,799
weburl

364
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,519
survey um site here's the the website

365
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:08,318
actually if you just Google web surl

366
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,679
survey you will get there and it allows

367
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:13,439
you to basically access S surfy

368
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,318
information uh for any location in in

369
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,639
the country what you would do is you

370
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:20,439
would start by uh pressing this uh

371
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:25,799
virtual button here that says start web

372
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:27,639
seral survey then you would uh get to um

373
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,559
through various screens you would get to

374
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,959
something like this let's say we're

375
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:35,318
interested in uh establishing some Berry

376
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,879
production on a field that we have

377
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:41,439
perhaps like here and um then we can get

378
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,000
a lot of basic information about that

379
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,079
soil from this web soil survey site so

380
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,240
on the left here you see uh this area is

381
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:53,559
an Ontario LOM 2 to 8% slope gives us

382
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,240
information on some basic

383
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:59,359
climatological information the uh

384
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,680
geomorphological setting of the soil

385
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,318
and uh some very basic

386
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:09,198
properties then we can uh get more

387
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:11,599
information uh for for this soil and

388
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,919
that's listed here on on the left uh the

389
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:17,198
basic chemical properties like calcium

390
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:21,199
carbonate content cation exchange

391
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:24,600
capacity uh pH gypsum level Etc now keep

392
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,079
in mind that uh this is sort of the

393
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,119
expected chemical properties is not

394
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:32,399
actually from this field it tends to be

395
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:35,319
from uh another C profile that is

396
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,280
representative of that field and it may

397
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:42,000
have been changed uh the previous user

398
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:43,079
may have changed the pH by lming or uh

399
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,200
the

400
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:48,240
uh the sodium absorption ratio may have

401
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,720
been changed so those are all things

402
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,359
that that at least you know provide a

403
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,600
starting point we see a lot of physical

404
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:58,599
properties they tend to be more uh

405
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:00,599
consistent so available water capacity

406
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:03,359
of bulk density allthough that may have

407
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:06,678
changed due to compaction uh organic

408
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,918
matter content uh texture Etc so there's

409
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:12,360
a lot of basic information also

410
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:14,320
including water table information that

411
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:17,678
uh is an excellent starting point that

412
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:21,480
you can access directly from the

413
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:25,360
web um now so that's uh that basically

414
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,360
relates to the inherent Cal properties

415
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:31,839
but um we typically want to get some

416
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:34,279
more detailed information not only uh

417
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,158
for it to be more site specific so

418
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,440
actually you know soal samples that were

419
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,720
collected from that particular field

420
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:45,000
where we're considering to establish uh

421
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,120
berries but also uh more uh detailed

422
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,519
information on the physical the

423
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,798
biological and the chemical components

424
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,918
of the soil and that's what the soil

425
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:57,359
Health test port Cornell soral Health

426
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,919
test basically attempts to do we've

427
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,279
selected

428
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,799
four physical indicators and physical in

429
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,319
our case is always indicated with the

430
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:08,200
letter blue or the the color blue

431
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:11,079
biological indicators also four

432
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,440
indicated in green and then the in

433
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:15,359
yellow The Chemical indicators the the

434
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,000
seral health test which will come back

435
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:21,879
to in later webinars of uh basically

436
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,720
uses the the standard seral nutrient

437
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,679
analysis and then has enhanced it with

438
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,038
uh four biological indicators organic

439
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,120
matter active carbon carbon potentially

440
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:34,400
mineralizable nitrogen and a root health

441
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:36,519
rating and then these four physical

442
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,240
indicators aggregate stability available

443
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:41,359
water capacity and heartness of the soil

444
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,159
in the surface and the

445
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:48,399
subsurface and then the test identifies

446
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:51,039
constraints and uh that then allows you

447
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,280
to uh take some management actions to

448
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,919
overcome those constraints so this is

449
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,038
just a basic introduction to that um but

450
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,159
one of the main points is that you know

451
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:02,599
the inherent

452
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,960
soal quality can be uh gathered from the

453
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:07,558
Cal survey information but the more

454
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,000
Dynamic soal quality or soal health you

455
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:12,240
want to get from from some more site

456
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,480
specific information like through a cal

457
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,599
Health

458
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,079
test okay so let's talk a little bit

459
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,918
about uh chemical uh processes most of

460
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,558
you I think are that's the area that

461
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,320
you're more familiar

462
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:27,839
with um there are a number of of

463
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,439
essential nutrients for plants on the

464
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,678
left we have

465
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,038
the uh the large the ones that are need

466
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:37,320
needed in larger amounts or

467
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,319
macronutrients including carbon oxygen

468
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,960
hydrogen which are basically around from

469
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:44,960
the air and water in the soil and then

470
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,200
we have the NPK nitrogen phosphorous

471
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,240
potassium calcium and mag magnesium and

472
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,880
sulfur that are needed in larger

473
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,919
quantities and any of these may be

474
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,200
limiting at any time on the right we

475
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:00,360
have the the micronutrients iron

476
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,360
manganese Etc and these are used in

477
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,319
relatively small

478
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:07,798
quantities um the the fortunate uh part

479
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:10,399
is that uh recommendations have been

480
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:12,240
developed over the past decades for the

481
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,320
management of all of these nutrients

482
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,159
typically what it requires is a is a

483
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:19,519
basic soil test and recommendations come

484
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,159
with that and uh it's a fairly

485
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:25,278
straightforward situation it's typically

486
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,120
relatively easy to correct any of these

487
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:29,079
uh deficiencies through the use of

488
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,479
fertilizer

489
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:35,599
uh pH tends to be a little bit more

490
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:39,558
tricky in in that uh Berry plants uh

491
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:42,158
favor different pH environments but also

492
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:45,759
uh the availability of various nutrients

493
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,760
is impacted by uh pH so on the right

494
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:52,119
here we have a scale from pH of 4 and a

495
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:56,200
half to eight and we see that different

496
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:59,599
nutrients nitrates potassium Etc are

497
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:02,720
available in uh more or less available

498
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:05,759
in different pH ranges for example

499
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,278
phosphates or phosphorus is not very

500
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:12,200
available either at very high pH or or

501
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:15,079
low PH calcium is is very available at

502
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,759
higher pH but not at the low PH where we

503
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:19,519
may have a lot of aluminum available and

504
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:23,879
in fact it may become

505
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:26,960
toxic iron uh very available at low PH

506
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,840
but not very available at high

507
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,600
pH um so at Etc so so pH is actually a

508
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:35,278
very critical component and and the

509
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,519
reason why I wanted to discuss this

510
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:41,440
separately is is that um from the uh

511
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:43,679
perspective of establishing berries you

512
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,480
need to address this upfront uh you got

513
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:51,120
to get to pH right uh from the start um

514
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,480
and before you establish the uh the

515
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,399
plans you have your your best

516
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,079
opportunity to correct any potential pH

517
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,880
problems again the soil test will

518
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,879
provide with the

519
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,360
recommendations um another concept that

520
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,000
we often talk about and those of you who

521
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,678
have taken a seral fertility class are

522
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,640
familiar with this is is the so-called

523
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:14,240
levix law of the minimum the idea is

524
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,559
that um that your yield or the the

525
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,720
ability of the of the plant to to be

526
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:22,119
productive is limited by the most

527
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,200
limiting nutrient so uh and it's

528
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:27,439
represented by this this bucket here in

529
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,240
our case uh nitrogen is the most

530
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,558
limiting nutrient

531
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,679
um and so the yield potential is limited

532
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,798
by the amount of nitrogen in the soil

533
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,400
this is here depicted by the the water

534
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:42,400
overflowing you can't get more water in

535
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,679
the bucket than the lowest level and the

536
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,798
most limiting

537
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,720
nutrient and so this is this is

538
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:50,440
generally generally true uh but there is

539
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,319
basically a broader perspective that we

540
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,480
now come to appreciate uh in the context

541
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:57,839
of soal health and that's basically that

542
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,400
it's not all about the soal chemistry

543
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:03,558
that it may actually be a physical or it

544
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,960
may be a biological process that is is

545
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:10,079
the most limiting factor in in the

546
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,600
production so it's uh it's not only

547
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,759
what's the most limiting chemical

548
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,839
element but it's all it's more what's

549
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,759
limiting otherwise so you may for

550
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,439
example have a very compacted soil and

551
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,278
there may be plenty of nutrients and you

552
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,320
may have actually applied a lot of these

553
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,079
uh these nutrients through fertilizer

554
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:28,798
but the fact that the soil is compacted

555
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:31,879
that the roots aren't growing well or

556
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:36,879
that you have Iration problems is uh is

557
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,880
then or has become the most limiting

558
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:43,119
element um Janet Fallon uh next week

559
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,720
we'll be talking about uh seral testing

560
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,079
and I won't go into a lot of detail uh

561
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,519
but an interesting uh point to keep in

562
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:53,319
mind is that that that a soil test is

563
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:56,558
basically an extraction procedure you

564
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:58,839
you um you you you basically extract

565
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,398
some of the elements through a solution

566
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:02,798
out of the soil that's you know being

567
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:05,079
filtered and then analyzed with various

568
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:07,119
equipment for example like an ICP or

569
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:08,519
something like that what's what's

570
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,359
important to keep in mind is that there

571
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:13,960
are uh many different so test solutions

572
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:16,479
that are being used around the country

573
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:20,038
even within the Northeast we have quite

574
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,480
a few uh different ones being used um

575
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:25,119
you know for example uh mik tree and

576
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,000
Morgan and modified Morgan are being

577
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,959
used uh around the Northeast it's

578
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,519
important to make the distinction

579
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,480
because the

580
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,319
interpretation of the Cal test results

581
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,200
and in this case for example it's for

582
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:41,398
phosphorus varies uh based on the type

583
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,120
of extraction that you use some of them

584
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:47,719
are more ex um aggressive extractants or

585
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,519
they're done at a different pH and so

586
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:54,640
you interpret the numbers differently

587
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:56,879
okay so for example um in a Morgan

588
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,080
analysis the optimum range is about for

589
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,200
Fosters is about 4 to 7 while the

590
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:07,359
equivalent for mik 3 is 15 to 31 so you

591
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,519
need to basically tie your soil test

592
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,759
results to the actual methodology that

593
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:15,000
was used in the testing procedure and

594
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:17,158
unfortunately For Better or Worse we're

595
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,960
using a lot of different procedures

596
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,200
around the region and and around the

597
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,720
country especially so keep that in mind

598
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,519
when you think about seral

599
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:30,240
testing okay let's move on to the uh

600
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:33,798
physical aspect aspects of the

601
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,240
soil so one of the the big factors

602
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:38,079
especially here in the Northeast that

603
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:41,278
that can you know limit the ability of

604
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,960
of of a of a a healthy plant is poor

605
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,240
internal drainage it can be the result

606
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,240
of uh either of local soil

607
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,480
hydrology uh because it's kind of in a

608
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,679
low spot in the landscape it can also be

609
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,919
because of impeding soil layers you may

610
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:58,000
have say a dense layer or a

611
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:00,278
fragipan that limits the percolation of

612
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,278
the water through the soil and thereby

613
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:05,079
causes poor drainage uh it's a big

614
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,880
problem poor drainage means poor

615
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:11,038
irration it uh tends to exacerbate

616
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:14,200
disease problems and all that and um and

617
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:17,759
if you are having or considering a a

618
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,880
field that has poor internal drainage uh

619
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,519
you either may may want to move to a

620
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,360
different field or you make sure that

621
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,839
you identify or that you that you

622
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,439
correct that problem through the

623
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:28,599
insulation of

624
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,759
drainage uh it is identif fing from

625
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:33,599
soral survey Publications I showed that

626
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:35,599
in one of the previous slides but I also

627
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:38,000
would uh always suggest because the

628
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:40,798
soral survey uh publication is is is

629
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,798
just kind of a first approximation to

630
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:46,440
also do some on-site s excavations if

631
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:51,200
you see modeling or you

632
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,798
know blotches of of iron rust or or

633
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,278
manganese which is which is it's black

634
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:57,759
blotches if you see that in the subur

635
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:00,200
you typically have a problem with the

636
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,720
fluctu waiting water table and therefore

637
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,120
you have imperfect

638
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,839
drainage um this will be a theme that

639
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:09,319
I'll be coming back to uh a lot of times

640
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:11,278
we ignore what's happening deeper in the

641
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:13,879
soil we tend to focus on on on the

642
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:16,000
surface oil but uh poor drainage is

643
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,880
often expressed a little bit deeper in

644
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,359
in the soil and so make sure you pay

645
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,120
attention to that we can of course

646
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:26,439
remediate uh poor internal drainage by

647
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:29,038
uh installing drain lines but also uh

648
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,600
race beds as you can see here on the on

649
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,839
the right now these are actually

650
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:35,319
Tomatoes um but I would I would suggest

651
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:39,199
with almost any type of um Berry

652
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:41,918
production that you want to use rais BS

653
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,640
um and and one of the reasons certainly

654
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,360
is to to improve the drainage or at

655
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,679
least during very wet periods it keeps

656
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:53,959
the um keeps the the roots of the of

657
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:56,759
your berries under aerobic conditions

658
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,558
and you prevent some of those problems

659
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,480
now keep in mind that in in in some

660
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:04,839
cases uh poor drainage is is not

661
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,440
necessarily related to soil layers or or

662
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:09,798
local soil hydrology but it can be a

663
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,720
symptom of of compaction so if you see a

664
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:16,038
lot of water sitting on the soil surface

665
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,399
um that maybe because the soils become

666
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:20,839
very degraded and compacted and it and

667
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,398
it and and the water doesn't move and

668
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,839
infiltrate through the soil uh which is

669
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:27,000
then a problem that you need to

670
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,119
separately address installing tile

671
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,558
drains doesn't necessarily solve that

672
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:34,239
problem you need to address that through

673
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:37,839
say organic matter additions or putting

674
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,839
in a cover crop or something like

675
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,360
that okay so um I always like to when I

676
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,038
talk about the physical properties of of

677
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,918
Cs I I like to uh discuss the importance

678
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:52,440
of of Aggregates um and here is a

679
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,320
picture of of a large aggregate uh

680
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,278
that's about of this

681
00:29:54,319 --> 00:30:01,359
size um and uh as you can see that aggre

682
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:04,000
is made up actually of three sub

683
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:07,158
Aggregates okay as you can see

684
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,679
here and each of those three are then in

685
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:12,480
turn made up of other sub agregates okay

686
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:16,519
so there's typically a hierarchical

687
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,278
system in a well aggregated soil and if

688
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,079
you especially have a finer textured

689
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:23,640
soil like a like a silt or clay LOM and

690
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:27,480
this aggregation is very important

691
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:30,519
because it creates larger pores while

692
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:33,120
also maintaining these smaller pores

693
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:35,278
larger pores are important for drainage

694
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,518
and eration and for root

695
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:40,558
development small pores on the other

696
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,359
hand are important for moisture

697
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:45,359
retention and then we want some

698
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,599
intermediate pores as well so that we

699
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,839
basically have a range also important

700
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,839
for water retention a lot of the

701
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:55,480
biological functions lot the organisms

702
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:58,240
dwell in these intermediate Force so

703
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,000
what we'd like to see with a good soil

704
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,120
is this range of pores from large to

705
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,638
intermediate to small well what happens

706
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:11,239
when a soil becomes compacted you mostly

707
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:13,719
lose in that case these large pores and

708
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,440
so what problems do you then get well

709
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,399
you get problems with drainage you get

710
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,159
problems with

711
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:23,879
Iration and root proliferation becomes a

712
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:26,720
factor okay so um so compaction

713
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,480
basically uh creates a lot of problems

714
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,480
uh that in turn can create other

715
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,679
problems like higher disease pressure

716
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,399
Etc

717
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,720
okay

718
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:40,759
um a little bit about water availability

719
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,000
to to plants you know most of you I

720
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:46,638
think are familiar with the idea of of

721
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,200
you know a soil that's that has poor

722
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,759
Plant water availability like like a

723
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,639
beach sand because it only has large

724
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:55,278
large pores it doesn't have any small

725
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:58,519
pores um on the other hand you may have

726
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:00,679
a a clay Loom that has a lot of a lot of

727
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,679
small pores and so that has much better

728
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,880
ability to retain

729
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:08,600
water um so it is a function of uh

730
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,399
texture organic matter content however

731
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:13,199
is also a very important component of

732
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:14,518
this because organic matter can really

733
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,880
act as a

734
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:20,240
sponge thirdly rooting depth is

735
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,080
important if you have uh roots that are

736
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,278
constrained say to only uh the top six

737
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:28,558
Ines then they won't be able to access

738
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:32,720
the water and the nutrients that are

739
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:35,079
deeper in the soil so compaction is a is

740
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,798
a big problem in that respect it reduces

741
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:41,199
both uh root proliferation and water

742
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,158
access uh by the plants but we can

743
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,278
improve that and we'll talk about that

744
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:47,240
uh later in in the course we can use

745
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:50,079
things like deep ripping as you see here

746
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:53,000
this is a strip tail piece of uh

747
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:56,798
equipment uh we can add compost for

748
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,519
example to improve the structure and the

749
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,839
aggregation and and the rooting so there

750
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,839
are ways to to address

751
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:07,000
that hor soils in in our climates are

752
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:10,599
often associated with with good drainage

753
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,240
so like a grally LOM or or lomy sand or

754
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:15,119
something like that and they tend to

755
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,880
then have problems with with water

756
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:19,879
stress in most cases that's that's not

757
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,960
desirable only I think if you're growing

758
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,278
grapes uh you often want a little bit of

759
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,600
water stress but for most berries it's

760
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:29,599
not very desirable and that means that

761
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:30,879
you may have to in in in irrigation

762
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,918
there's some very good irrigation

763
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,440
systems available now um and a lot of

764
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,240
that requires some upfront

765
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,080
considerations uh so thinking ahead of

766
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,120
time of what the uh water storage

767
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:46,759
capacity of your soil is and whether you

768
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:48,879
need to invest in irrigation is is an

769
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,558
important

770
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,600
consideration okay so let's talk a

771
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:55,480
little bit about soil compaction uh on

772
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:58,678
the left you see a soil with good

773
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:01,599
rooting um The Roots extend uh both in

774
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:04,000
the surface layer as well as into the

775
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,638
subsoil and the deeper layers so that

776
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,039
means that this plant would have a lot

777
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:11,279
of water and nutrients available to it

778
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:14,838
also like to see you know fairly dense

779
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,440
rooting patterns on the right we see a

780
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:20,000
soil that has multiple compaction

781
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,000
problems first it has it may have a

782
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,440
crust on the surface which is uh this

783
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,320
often happens when the soil is exposed

784
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,480
to the elements especially the raindrops

785
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,760
and that reduces infiltration and causes

786
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,398
runoff and erosion problems it may also

787
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,200
have very tightly packed crumbs so we've

788
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:43,118
lost those large pores that are

789
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:46,678
essential for eras and water

790
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,879
transmission and um also it limits the

791
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,240
rooting so now we only have a few roots

792
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:53,279
and in this particular case We

793
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:55,398
additionally have a subur compaction

794
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,119
problem so the roots don't even go down

795
00:34:55,398 --> 00:35:01,799
into the deeper layers and cannot access

796
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:01,800
the water and nutrients in those

797
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,079
layers so what are sort of the symptoms

798
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,559
well extended periods of saturation are

799
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,480
often a symptom of of compaction you see

800
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,159
that here on on the left that if you

801
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,240
have compacted layer you have the water

802
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:20,399
doesn't drain um standing water

803
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,838
following a rain or irrigation they all

804
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,400
may be indicators of plow layer

805
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:27,279
compaction um if the soil gets tilled

806
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,720
and of course you know you may only do

807
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,800
this uh at in the establishment phase

808
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:34,799
but if you see these big clouds uh

809
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,480
that's uh typically an indication of a

810
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,720
very compacted soil and uh that's uh

811
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:45,000
something that you want to want to

812
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:46,679
address um just tilling it and um and

813
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,199
you know say doing some primary tillet

814
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:51,399
but then say you know doing discing and

815
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,118
harrowing and pulverizing that soil

816
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,039
doesn't really address the problem

817
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,440
because soon enough that soil will

818
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:00,480
settle as you can see on the right here

819
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,599
it uh you know once once it gets wet it

820
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,280
will settle and it will become dense and

821
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:08,519
it will be hard and The Roots will have

822
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,680
problems growing through it okay so I

823
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:14,199
highly recommend doing some uh some

824
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:16,078
upfront work um and uh do a little

825
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:18,598
shovel take a shovel out or a

826
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,519
penetrometer or something like that and

827
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,079
and look and see whether you have any of

828
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:25,759
these problems because some of the past

829
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:28,519
management of that particular field you

830
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,319
know prior to establishing the the berry

831
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:33,280
plants uh may be uh may have caused

832
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:35,960
considerable compaction and you first

833
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,920
want to address that in

834
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,119
aate you know just there a little bit

835
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,960
more information on on that uh wanted to

836
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,838
show this to you uh this is actually

837
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,800
part of a video clip that I can't show

838
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:51,159
because of the limitation of the of of

839
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,720
the the webinar technology um but

840
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:56,519
there's two two important points one

841
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:59,358
that um a root is a certain Dimension

842
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:02,960
and especially the root tip and so you

843
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:07,119
need pores that are greater than2 mm for

844
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,960
a root tip to enter into a pore um and

845
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:13,200
it C first needs to wedge itself into

846
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,119
that pore and then it starts to push the

847
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:18,039
particles in the Aggregates to the side

848
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,800
and if that soil is very hard and it has

849
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:23,480
a strength of greater than 300 PSI then

850
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,839
it has great difficulty doing that so

851
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,199
for roots to grow well you need pores

852
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:31,239
that are greater than2 mm

853
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:33,279
and strength that is less than 300 PSI

854
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:36,118
and typically what that means is is a

855
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:40,599
well aggregated soil or a naturally

856
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:44,160
softer soil like a um like a Sandy uh

857
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:46,559
Sandy LOM or silt Loom type soil on the

858
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,559
right here you see an example of uh

859
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:53,078
where this was a problem uh there's a

860
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:55,639
big soil clot we see one root here uh

861
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,800
that sort of explored a little bit of

862
00:37:55,639 --> 00:38:01,078
that soil it has some a few fine root

863
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,880
hairs but most of that soil is basically

864
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:06,000
not being explored by The Roots so the

865
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,519
water and nutrients that are in in the

866
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,639
rest of the soil volume are inaccessible

867
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:14,358
to the plant so that tends to cause more

868
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:14,358
stress for the

869
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,119
plant so what are some of the causes of

870
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,119
uh of plow layer compaction well

871
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,039
basically a loss of organic matter uh

872
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:29,318
and thereby aggregate stability uh

873
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:32,000
mostly from intensive tillage so so if

874
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:34,400
this field has a legacy of intensive

875
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,318
tillage maybe you know vegetable

876
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,599
production or potatoes or field crops

877
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:41,719
and low organic matter contents you're

878
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,160
going to have some of these type of

879
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:46,480
problems also of course if there's no

880
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,118
been been no organic matter addition so

881
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,559
if there's not a history of say manure

882
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,559
application or compost then you have

883
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,920
greater potential for problems if

884
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:58,480
there's been a lot of traffic when the

885
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:01,800
soil was wet a lack of control traffic

886
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,039
so basically the entire field was

887
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,560
compacted and if we had a lot of Cal

888
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:08,559
settling

889
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,519
from so those are some of the primary

890
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,039
causes and you may want to look at the

891
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:15,400
history of that field to see whether

892
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:18,519
that that was a problem so let's briefly

893
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,480
talk about uh subur compaction so now

894
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,759
we're we're considering not the the

895
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,280
surface layer but really the compaction

896
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,400
that's deeper in the soil and it tends

897
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,920
to be a little bit more difficult to

898
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,160
address and it's also it's very

899
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,519
invisible uh you don't see the subsoil

900
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,759
unless you really make an effort and you

901
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:38,480
dig down to

902
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,200
it um also a lot of people are not aware

903
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:45,519
of the causes of that and so uh if you

904
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:47,480
are in a field that has say a history of

905
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,440
heavy traffic like manure spreaders

906
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:53,480
especially on wet soils you may have a

907
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,760
problem with subal compaction of deeper

908
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,639
the deeper layers may have become very

909
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,119
very dense because the the the loads

910
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:03,639
from this heavy equipment are basically

911
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,519
transferred deeper into the soil and

912
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:09,118
when that soil is wet it can pack

913
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:10,759
them um this is especially a problem if

914
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,599
there's a poor weight distribution of

915
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,839
the equipment so some of the more modern

916
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:18,318
equipment have less of a problem um but

917
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,679
uh if this field has a history of the

918
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:23,239
kind of stuff you see on the left here

919
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:25,480
you probably have a fairly serious sub

920
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:28,479
compaction in addition to having

921
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,760
compaction near the surface

922
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,240
if there's been a history with uh of

923
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,319
plowing because a lot of plowing occurs

924
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:37,598
with the wheel in the open Furrow which

925
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:39,639
means that the subsoil is directly

926
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,960
compacted um so it's definitely

927
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:44,598
something to look into with say a

928
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,838
penetrometer

929
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:51,760
um some digging so it's important to

930
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:53,519
consider where the compaction is and

931
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,000
these penetrometers they're relatively

932
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,838
inexpensive tools it cost a little over

933
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,159
$200 something you can borrow them from

934
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:04,679
an extension agent or a or a sood and

935
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:06,358
water specialist are very valuable tools

936
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:09,159
and they are also an integral part of

937
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:11,799
our Coral seral Health test if you have

938
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:14,679
that uh deep Cal compaction maybe some

939
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,599
deep Tilles needed deep rooted cover

940
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:20,639
crop maybe needs to be established

941
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:23,838
before you uh you transplant your

942
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:25,679
berries um shallow compaction requires a

943
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:28,759
different strategy than deep compaction

944
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:31,078
and that's why it's important to measure

945
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,160
where the compaction is and we'll come

946
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:37,119
back to this in in

947
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:39,559
the seminars later in the

948
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,519
program okay so we talked about the the

949
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:46,400
chemical the physical and now uh let's

950
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:48,400
discuss the the C biology this is a the

951
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,039
component of the C that uh that that's

952
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,358
still very much at at the frontier of of

953
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:57,679
science uh CS are extremely

954
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:59,960
complex um and have very very able

955
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,679
conditions but we do know that most of

956
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,318
the biological activity occurs near the

957
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:07,440
surface the reason being uh that that's

958
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:10,719
where the most of the organic matter is

959
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,400
from uh basically often from the uh the

960
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:15,719
plant sources that that decay and the

961
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,240
organic matter decreases as we go

962
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:22,719
further into the soil and thereby also

963
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,719
the biological activity decreases

964
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,760
considerably we often and we I mean Fred

965
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,239
magdoff and I and we co-authored a book

966
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,480
that I'll I'll refer to a little bit

967
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:36,679
later we like to think in terms of

968
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:41,000
organic matter as as three General types

969
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:43,558
the Living Dead and the Very dead and

970
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,960
I'll talk about each of those

971
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,519
individually uh but all three are very

972
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,199
important in terms of the functioning of

973
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:53,679
the soil and to produce high yields and

974
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:55,919
healthy crops so let's first start

975
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:58,960
talking about the The Living

976
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,639
Part um oh no let's see there's a quick

977
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,199
overview of each of those I'm sorry I'm

978
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,318
getting ahead of myself so the the

979
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:08,118
living component of the soil is is what

980
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:10,599
is alive in the soil basically uh so

981
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:13,240
these organisms uh they play important

982
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,720
roles in making nutrients available

983
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:18,558
suppressing disease producing plant

984
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:20,838
growth uh promoting hormones creating

985
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,880
humus aggregating soils and there

986
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:25,159
probably a few other things we can

987
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,039
mention another living component is

988
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:30,679
plant roots they are also it's the below

989
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:33,119
ground part of the of the plants and

990
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:34,598
they also are are typically very

991
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,240
beneficial and of course they're they're

992
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:39,599
needed for the plants to

993
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:41,679
grow the Dead part relates to the

994
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,000
recently dead organisms and crop

995
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:47,000
residues that provide basically the

996
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,760
energy and nutrients uh for the so

997
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,559
organisms to live and function also

998
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,160
often call this active or particulate

999
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:59,040
organic matter okay so this is the the

1000
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:59,039
food that sustains the system

1001
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,599
the third component is is basically the

1002
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:06,358
fraction of the organic matter that's

1003
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,280
that's not as active biologically that

1004
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:11,159
has become very well

1005
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:13,559
decomposed but that is really quite

1006
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:15,960
recalcitrant and we often refers to that

1007
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:19,400
as as humus or the kind of black

1008
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,880
material in the soil uh but it's also

1009
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,760
very beneficial primarily in terms of

1010
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,280
supporting some of the physical and

1011
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,880
chemical functions it has a high amounts

1012
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,400
of negative large so it allows it to

1013
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,039
hold nutrients it allows it to hold

1014
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,800
water and it also stores a lot of the

1015
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:37,079
the

1016
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,559
carbon so let's look at each of those in

1017
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:42,000
a little bit more detail so the living

1018
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:44,559
here and you know we can uh we can teach

1019
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,920
an entire course on this it's all those

1020
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:51,079
organisms like the bacteria fungi

1021
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,920
nematodes earthworms mites springtails

1022
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:57,318
moles and many other organisms that are

1023
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,760
in the soil that all uh play a very very

1024
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:01,239
important role in terms of seral food

1025
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,119
web they all

1026
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:06,879
interact in often very very complex ways

1027
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,200
and then of course the plant roots as

1028
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,838
you as you can see here on the left you

1029
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:14,399
have the the

1030
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:17,199
microorganisms uh on the right here you

1031
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,599
have these these might call

1032
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:24,078
Critters colon bone col balls the

1033
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:27,000
spiders the mites Etc and then we might

1034
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,318
even have things like earthworm or even

1035
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,838
even you know macroorganisms like like

1036
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:35,599
moles that of course also impact

1037
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:38,000
soil these organisms use the resources

1038
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:41,119
in the soil that's where they live they

1039
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,719
decompose organic matter they cycle

1040
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:46,358
nutrients and they influence plants and

1041
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:49,118
and all the other

1042
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:51,159
biota they respond to chemical and

1043
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,318
physical environment so if you for

1044
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:57,279
example have a very compacted soil so

1045
00:45:54,318 --> 00:46:00,199
unfavorable physical environment uh you

1046
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03,079
will have many uh you will have less

1047
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:04,759
organisms and less diversity uh for

1048
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:07,400
example if you have a soil like you see

1049
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:10,480
here in in the middle picture very

1050
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:13,200
compacted exposed to the elements uh so

1051
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,039
therefore uh the organisms have to deal

1052
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:18,519
with heat and moisture extremes as

1053
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:20,599
opposed to a situation here where we

1054
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:23,358
have compost on the soil and soil is

1055
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:26,400
protected it's a much more favorable

1056
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:29,199
requirement if you have say low PH or

1057
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,240
high pH age that all impacts these

1058
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:34,919
organisms but vice versa these organisms

1059
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:37,279
also affect uh the chemical and physical

1060
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,039
environment they can be beneficial for

1061
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:43,200
example if you have a lot of plant roots

1062
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:46,480
or you have a lot of um

1063
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,279
um organisms that that decompose organic

1064
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,920
matter that creates better aggregation

1065
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:55,240
so better physical environment better

1066
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:59,079
Iration better water transmission Etc so

1067
00:46:55,239 --> 00:47:01,039
it goes both ways um the organisms uh

1068
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:03,519
respond to the environment and they

1069
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:05,440
manipulate the

1070
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:07,759
environment uh there's there's some

1071
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,519
organisms that are are are particularly

1072
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:15,440
not worthy one is micro risey and these

1073
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:17,960
are those are basically uh fungi and

1074
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,639
with with extended hyy as you can see in

1075
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,760
this this picture that in a way you can

1076
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:25,598
think of as a symbiotic relationship

1077
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:28,920
with plant roots that can extend the

1078
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:32,200
plant roots into to the soil and all and

1079
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:35,400
basically facilitate better nutrient uh

1080
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:36,519
acquisition and and use so they enhance

1081
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,280
nutrient

1082
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:41,759
uptake phosphorus nitrogen potassium and

1083
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,319
micronutrients but especially phosphorus

1084
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,040
is often very uh very much enhanced by

1085
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:51,880
micro Rising uh they help at soil

1086
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:54,880
aggregation form uh of defense against

1087
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:58,559
pathogens protect plants against

1088
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,280
phytotoxicity and enhance Fitness in in

1089
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,319
so micro

1090
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:07,000
rizy and especially in in soils that are

1091
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:10,159
not Disturbed can be very

1092
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,480
beneficial another important uh concept

1093
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:16,399
is that of of suppressive

1094
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:18,960
soils that um we often have problems

1095
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:23,280
with certain diseases pythium phyra

1096
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:25,800
ronia Etc and um if we create a healthy

1097
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,200
soil with uh lots of organisms

1098
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:32,760
beneficial organisms like camonis and

1099
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:35,598
traderma um they actually provide an

1100
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:40,000
ability to suppress some of these

1101
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:44,760
calborn pathogens basically by either uh

1102
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,358
a direct um suppression or basically by

1103
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,520
uh a larger abundance and and sort of

1104
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:54,239
out competing some of these pathogen

1105
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:56,280
organisms so having a a rich soil uh

1106
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:57,279
often can be very beneficial in terms of

1107
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,440
producing

1108
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,519
as

1109
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:05,280
pressure so how do management practices

1110
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:08,119
affect soil life well intensive tillage

1111
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,680
reduces micro isic colonizations reduces

1112
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:15,680
diversity of soil organisms so tillet is

1113
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:17,879
often uh not favorable for healthy soils

1114
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,919
organic matter application is favorable

1115
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,880
it increases diversity density and

1116
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:27,760
activity of these organisms fertilizer

1117
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:29,960
application uh um affects the uh

1118
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,040
various organisms it proliferates the

1119
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:36,358
growth of fast growing Mar organisms

1120
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:39,358
typically more bacteria but reduces say

1121
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:42,000
fungi and it reduces say nitrogen

1122
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,759
fixating organisms as well and

1123
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,838
irrigation and drainage of course

1124
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:50,960
affects the anerobic versus aerobic

1125
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:53,318
organisms so we talked about the living

1126
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,519
now a little bit about about the dead

1127
00:49:53,318 --> 00:49:57,558
organisms uh so that's basically crop

1128
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,480
residues and and

1129
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:02,680
dead plant roots and all that and think

1130
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,400
of that as the food that sustains these

1131
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:07,558
organisms in the soil these are

1132
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,960
nutrients and and energy that help uh

1133
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,680
feed these organisms that are so

1134
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,960
important so the soil food web which is

1135
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:18,558
depicted here uh we're not talking about

1136
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:21,679
a food chain but a more complex food web

1137
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:26,119
where um multiple organisms are involved

1138
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:28,480
in um in the use of of basically this

1139
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:31,079
organic matter so it's the or organic

1140
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,039
matter in the soil uh that may be

1141
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:37,400
applied through manure or compost or

1142
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:40,079
maybe Dead uh roots or Surface material

1143
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:43,639
that basically feeds all these other

1144
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:47,039
organisms bacteria fungi

1145
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:49,558
nematodes uh that in turn affects all

1146
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:52,679
these other organisms like protozoa

1147
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:55,920
arthropods and so you kind of go up the

1148
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:57,879
food web and the food chain um but the

1149
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,519
important point here is that if you

1150
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,960
don't Supply this organic matter if it's

1151
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:05,480
not there then these organisms cannot

1152
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,240
Thrive and that's what often is referred

1153
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:10,240
to as the bottom up effect or the

1154
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,279
abundance of a resource affects the

1155
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,719
abundance of its consumers and think of

1156
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,359
it in terms of the human analogy if we

1157
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:20,078
did not feed ourselves and get our

1158
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:22,598
energy and nutrients we would not Thrive

1159
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:24,200
either and so it's just as important in

1160
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:27,119
in the

1161
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:30,358
soil so the very dead component then is

1162
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,400
the is is this well decomposed material

1163
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:36,679
uh you often see that as sort of the the

1164
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:39,318
black part of the soil the dark part um

1165
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:42,440
and so it is very important for water

1166
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:47,079
holding capacity but also to retain cat

1167
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:50,559
ions um and um and so it especially in a

1168
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:53,200
sandy soil increasing the humus content

1169
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:56,200
allows for better water and nutrient

1170
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,199
storage

1171
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,318
an important point I think by now I

1172
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:03,798
think uh has been that that we have this

1173
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:05,838
interaction of the physical the chemical

1174
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:07,880
and the biological so in the past

1175
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:11,119
because we focused so much on the

1176
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:14,680
chemical um we didn't have the all these

1177
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,720
benefits of these interactions now based

1178
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:20,279
on the discussions I'll give you five

1179
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:24,639
seconds to think of any examples of how

1180
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,640
each of these Realms interact

1181
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:31,000
I wish I could ask you how many of you

1182
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:35,480
could come up with one or two or three

1183
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,639
but here are a number that uh that I uh

1184
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:40,280
that I came up with and I've indicated

1185
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:43,639
that blue is being a physical process

1186
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:46,839
green being a biological process and

1187
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:49,480
yellow being a chemical process so for

1188
00:52:46,838 --> 00:52:50,558
example hard soil a physical process

1189
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,039
reduces

1190
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,760
rooting ped soil suppresses beneficial

1191
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:59,679
biological processes

1192
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,760
also increases root diseases and

1193
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,960
denitrification both biological

1194
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,400
processes organic matter decomposition

1195
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:12,199
of biological processes process

1196
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:14,920
increases aggregation etc etc okay uh

1197
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:17,960
tillage in the bottom here increases

1198
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:20,798
bacteria and decreases fungi so there's

1199
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:23,838
many ways in which these interact and I

1200
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:26,559
think the the point is that if you know

1201
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:29,078
with our past emphasis on the chemical

1202
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,680
part we've often not given enough

1203
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:34,480
consideration for these biological and

1204
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:37,159
physical components so I think it's

1205
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,318
become clear I think that uh adding

1206
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:41,960
organic matter results in in many

1207
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:44,000
benefits and this is a depiction it's

1208
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,480
actually from a picture from Lori

1209
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,280
drinkwater in the horiculture department

1210
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,240
all the benefits of adding organic

1211
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:54,319
matter it increases biological activity

1212
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:56,759
and composition nutrient release

1213
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:58,159
detoxifies harmful substances it

1214
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,040
increases

1215
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:03,118
aggregation uh it promotes hum humus and

1216
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:06,358
other growth promoting substances

1217
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:09,280
increases Poe structure improv soil uh

1218
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:11,639
Toth and water storage and all in all

1219
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,599
healthier plants okay so this is just

1220
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:17,798
the general

1221
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:20,440
that um so a couple more points I wanted

1222
00:54:17,798 --> 00:54:22,440
to make is that uh is is what has

1223
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,838
happened over the past decades is that

1224
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:28,838
it's been a different Paradigm in in

1225
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:30,679
soil management um so in in the old days

1226
00:54:28,838 --> 00:54:33,039
certainly in terms of the natural

1227
00:54:30,679 --> 00:54:34,960
ecosystems they evolved with little

1228
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:36,960
disturbance they were either forest or

1229
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,960
grassland or something like that

1230
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,000
nutrients were recycled through organic

1231
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,639
materials like leaves and animal

1232
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,639
droppings the decomposing materials

1233
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:48,558
would be feeding the soil it would be

1234
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:52,159
nutrients and carbon and stimulated

1235
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:54,000
diverse biological activity and then

1236
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:57,239
this organic material was then

1237
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,920
mineralized by all these uh or organisms

1238
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:02,879
and that in turn would feed the plants

1239
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,480
so uh so the plants were in a way fed

1240
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,838
indirectly the nutrients and the energy

1241
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:11,719
came from the surface was processed by

1242
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:14,639
these organisms and that in turn fed the

1243
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:16,759
plants in modern agriculture with the

1244
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:19,199
onset of the use of

1245
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,160
fertilizer uh We've started to disturb

1246
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:23,078
the soil through a lot of tillage and so

1247
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:25,598
we accelerated organic matter

1248
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:28,039
mineralization and we have now lower

1249
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,318
organic matter levels in the soils and

1250
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:32,119
we use chemical fertilizers where we

1251
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,798
basically feed to plant

1252
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:38,119
directly rather than indirectly through

1253
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:39,960
the addition of organic materials and so

1254
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:43,039
uh We've stopped feeding all the so

1255
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:46,318
organisms so we've seen over the decades

1256
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:49,440
uh a very big difference in terms of the

1257
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:52,960
Ecology of the soil and that's why the

1258
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:55,880
physical and the biological processes in

1259
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,240
the cils have become very compromised

1260
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:01,119
because of those

1261
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:03,919
practices so few important points

1262
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,880
inherent versus Dynamics or equality

1263
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,599
okay so what we get is a natural soil

1264
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,960
versus how we manage it and we're going

1265
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:15,359
to focus especially on this Dynamic soil

1266
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:18,119
health component physical chemical and

1267
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:21,400
biological and I think by now I hope you

1268
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:24,240
sort of appreciate the importance of all

1269
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,798
of those components and they are equally

1270
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:28,358
important a little bit about pre and

1271
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:30,119
post establishment and I'll talk about

1272
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:31,159
that in the next couple of slides

1273
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:32,640
because that's an important

1274
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:35,279
consideration from a management

1275
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,879
perspective remember both the surface

1276
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,760
and the subsoil are

1277
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:42,440
important and also we have to think in

1278
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:45,119
terms of short-term and long-term

1279
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:47,400
management a lot of the chemical

1280
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,400
management is short-term there's a

1281
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,960
There's a constraint say low phosphorus

1282
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,720
levels we apply fertilizer problem

1283
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,199
solved with soil Health we often have to

1284
00:56:54,719 --> 00:57:00,759
look at a more long-term

1285
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:03,519
approach so when it comes to Berry

1286
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:06,440
production most opportune time for seral

1287
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:09,759
health Improvement is typically prior to

1288
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:11,599
planting uh installing drain tiles

1289
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:15,079
correcting sub cural

1290
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:17,920
fertility PHH maybe deep ripping or

1291
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:21,160
other types of deep tillers compost

1292
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,920
applications cover cropping all prior to

1293
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:25,038
establishment that's when you have the

1294
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,159
opportunity to address a lot of these

1295
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:29,720
constraints and keep keep in mind that

1296
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:32,719
subcell properties are not always that

1297
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:35,318
visible or any constraint that you might

1298
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:36,519
have okay but they are important for

1299
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:39,639
perennial

1300
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:41,639
crops and then of course you still have

1301
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:43,199
opportunities for post establishment Cal

1302
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:47,078
Health Management like for example

1303
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:49,960
continuous supply of of compost using

1304
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:53,519
mulches to protect the

1305
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,480
soil uh to promote good uh biological

1306
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:58,519
activity sometimes we can use the

1307
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:01,199
interos for say cover crops uh as you

1308
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:04,920
see in this particular case these are

1309
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:08,159
grape Vines so we have to distinguish a

1310
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:10,760
little bit between pre and post

1311
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:12,558
establishment so this is my final slide

1312
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,280
uh just some reference material here is

1313
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:18,839
our uh the website uh for the seral

1314
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,559
health program is listed here and uh

1315
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:22,480
when you go there you see you get to

1316
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,760
this point there's a lot of other sites

1317
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,519
that that go with that you can download

1318
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,839
the seral Health Training manual which

1319
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:32,599
we'll refer to at a later point in time

1320
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:34,880
and uh if you're interested in a broader

1321
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:36,559
perspective on seral Health Management

1322
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,160
this is a book that I co-authored with

1323
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,400
Fred magdoff from the University of

1324
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,920
Vermont titled building soils for better

1325
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,960
crops which is really about about

1326
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,358
sustainable so management or or soil

1327
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,798
Health Management um it's available from

1328
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:53,119
the sustainable EG Network it can also

1329
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:57,079
be downloaded as a PDF file um from

1330
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:58,838
their website and so with that Jeff I'll

1331
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:01,720
hand it back to

1332
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:05,119
you all right thanks Harold um and this

1333
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:06,519
is where we enter our Q&amp;A period and and

1334
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,599
I encourage you if you have any

1335
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:11,079
questions to type them into the chat box

1336
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:12,798
and we'll address them as they come uh

1337
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:16,160
there were a few questions early on

1338
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:20,679
Kathy asked the question what is soil

1339
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:23,798
tilth uh soil tilth um um is basically

1340
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:26,759
relates to the kind of the aggregation

1341
00:59:23,798 --> 00:59:30,400
structure of of of the soil

1342
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:33,640
so a a soil that has good uh soil tills

1343
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:37,039
is is not compacted it has these

1344
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:39,400
Aggregates um and it typically if you

1345
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:42,359
disturb the soil it it it don't doesn't

1346
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:44,760
come up as clots but it comes up as nice

1347
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:47,400
Frable material that's maybe the best

1348
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:51,319
way to characterize that I think of C

1349
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,318
tilt to some extent as as

1350
00:59:52,719 --> 01:00:00,519
aggregation okay and a second question

1351
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:04,159
can a fragipan layer be fixed by

1352
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:06,358
subsoiling um that's a good question yes

1353
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:07,960
you can you can initially you know

1354
01:00:06,358 --> 01:00:10,480
depending on the depth of the of the

1355
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:14,318
fraer pan layer if it's very deep uh

1356
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:17,240
let's say you know uh 2 and A2 ft then

1357
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:20,719
it's difficult to get down that far um

1358
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:24,959
but if it's a shallow layer you can but

1359
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:28,598
they do tend to reform so it's um if you

1360
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:32,400
were considering establishing berries on

1361
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:35,640
on a frag pan soil I would definitely do

1362
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,358
that tillage the the the deep tillage

1363
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:41,318
but they do tend to reestablish over a

1364
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:45,279
longer time period and I'm talking more

1365
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:47,838
maybe 8 to 10 or

1366
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:51,280
years thanks Harold I have a question of

1367
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:54,558
my own um you talked about surface

1368
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,440
compaction versus uh uh compaction in

1369
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:57,798
the in the deeper layers

1370
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,318
and now there's you know a lot of

1371
01:00:57,798 --> 01:01:03,280
discussion about the use of cover crops

1372
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:07,159
uh to deal with uh compaction issues can

1373
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,359
you comment on cover cropping use for uh

1374
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:11,519
compaction

1375
01:01:08,358 --> 01:01:15,000
modification yeah so um you know when we

1376
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:16,960
think about cover crops we uh we have to

1377
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,559
have to consider what really our

1378
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,519
objective is with the use of a cover

1379
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:23,920
crop so if we have a compaction problem

1380
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:27,400
near the surface we might uh want to use

1381
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:29,639
a very dense and fibrous cover a crop uh

1382
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:32,798
like a like Ry grass or something like

1383
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:35,639
that if we have a compaction deeper in

1384
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:38,559
the soil we want to get want to use a

1385
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:41,639
cover crop that has strong roots that go

1386
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:45,240
deeper into the soil um for example

1387
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:48,480
alala Roots do that um there's a lot of

1388
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:50,959
interest in using say radishes that uh

1389
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,318
that very aggressively grow deeper into

1390
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,599
the soil as well um so so when it comes

1391
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:59,000
to to cover cropping you really have to

1392
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:01,119
think about what your primary objective

1393
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,679
is and you know compaction relief is

1394
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:07,119
only one of of uh several you may also

1395
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:09,919
want to consider um adding nitrogen or

1396
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:12,838
you want to use a cover crop so you get

1397
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:15,798
some mulch um so like for example the

1398
01:02:12,838 --> 01:02:20,960
picture that I showed of the um of the

1399
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:22,838
The Vineyard that had um that had um Ry

1400
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,318
growing in the in the inter Rose they

1401
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:26,358
use that then to uh they cut that and

1402
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:28,440
they use that

1403
01:02:26,358 --> 01:02:31,038
to spread that over over the over the

1404
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,519
Cal service um so you have all these

1405
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,520
different objectives with with cover

1406
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:36,759
crops which is you know an interesting

1407
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:39,480
point in and by itself if you're

1408
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:41,760
interested uh in in using cover crop

1409
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:44,358
there there is a great

1410
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,920
publication and I believe it's titled

1411
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:48,960
managing cover crops profitably it's

1412
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,639
also published by the sustainable egg

1413
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,519
Network I know many of you are probably

1414
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:55,118
familiar with it for those of you who

1415
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:58,358
are not uh that is really an outstanding

1416
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:00,278
publication and it it IT addresses the

1417
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:02,838
management of cover crops from the

1418
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:05,079
perspective of what your objectives are

1419
01:03:02,838 --> 01:03:09,880
you know nitrogen management compaction

1420
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:11,240
relief you know uh surface cover Etc so

1421
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:14,079
that's I'm sorry Jeff that's a bit a

1422
01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:15,919
little bit of a long-winded uh answer

1423
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,160
but uh you know there's cover crops and

1424
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,200
there's cover crops and you want to make

1425
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:21,440
sure that you select the right one for

1426
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:23,838
the problem that you're trying to

1427
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,240
address well thank you very much and I

1428
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:28,838
think Tom borkman also had has a

1429
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:31,078
web-based tool that uh does a pretty

1430
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:33,880
good job of describing the attributes of

1431
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:37,160
different cover crops right uh Kathy in

1432
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:40,640
the meantime had a uh a comment or

1433
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:43,399
question related to subsoiling and its

1434
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:45,239
uh use for crops like strawberries or

1435
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:50,278
raspberries that have maybe a shorter

1436
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:50,278
shorter time frame than something like

1437
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:59,400
blueberries um can you cut yeah uh yeah

1438
01:03:55,798 --> 01:04:01,278
perhaps I'm somewhat misrepresented this

1439
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,400
in that there's um there's various

1440
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:05,039
components to it when you when you think

1441
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:09,278
about

1442
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:11,880
um subing to overcome a frag pan then

1443
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:14,760
you you do allow those roots to move

1444
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:17,480
into that frag pan and even though the

1445
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:20,039
frag pan May somewhat re

1446
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:24,039
reestablish once the roots are in there

1447
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:27,359
they are there basically and um so the

1448
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:29,000
subsoiling is is is is always beneficial

1449
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:30,480
even though you know with blueberries

1450
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,760
maybe you're looking at a much longer

1451
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,240
time Horizon it's it's those first years

1452
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:38,000
that are most critical so that you can

1453
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:40,798
get those roots down there so uh I think

1454
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,119
it's in almost all cases it's it's

1455
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:45,798
beneficial do the sub soiling if you

1456
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,798
have a fagy

1457
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:52,679
pan thank you I have an additional

1458
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:55,480
question you mentioned a couple of

1459
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:58,639
situations tillage uh was one of them

1460
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:01,240
where where you're favoring um bacteria

1461
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:04,598
over fungi you also mentioned that the

1462
01:05:01,239 --> 01:05:06,759
use of fertilizer does the same thing uh

1463
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:09,160
does does developing a cover crop

1464
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:12,880
actually work in the opposite direction

1465
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:15,960
of boosting the the fungi

1466
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:17,519
population yes it it it it it tends to

1467
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,440
especially if you don't do a lot of

1468
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:22,679
disturbance you know I when we talk

1469
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,559
about cover crops one thing you try to

1470
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:26,480
prevent doing a lot of tillet to is

1471
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,079
establish a cover crop so you'd like to

1472
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:31,079
do it with with equipment that uh you

1473
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:34,278
know like a noil drill or something like

1474
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:36,798
that um I think with with with very

1475
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:39,358
production of course you you don't do uh

1476
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:40,960
much tillage maybe only early on but I

1477
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:42,960
think what's critical is to think about

1478
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:46,278
the history of that site so if there's

1479
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:50,358
been a lot of P tillage then uh then it

1480
01:05:46,278 --> 01:05:52,318
has impacted uh bacteria versus fungi

1481
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:55,358
bacteria being more common with with

1482
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:58,400
intensively tilt and fertilized fields

1483
01:05:55,358 --> 01:06:00,920
and you know when you have uh say Berry

1484
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:03,318
production you would like to like to see

1485
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:05,720
you know more fungi because of the the

1486
01:06:03,318 --> 01:06:07,798
benefits that it that it provides it

1487
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:10,558
will of course change over time because

1488
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:13,719
once you establish your field and your

1489
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:15,559
your your your berries you will um you

1490
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:18,679
won't do much intensive tillage and if

1491
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:20,798
you manage it well and you supply your

1492
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:26,719
organic materials you will see a gradual

1493
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:26,719
change in in the biology of of that soil

1494
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:34,039
I'm waiting to see if uh an has a

1495
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:36,239
question here Ann has a long question I

1496
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:36,240
can

1497
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:45,278
see oh she it's more of a comment for

1498
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:48,920
everyone else yeah

1499
01:06:45,278 --> 01:06:51,960
yeah um and this is putting you on the

1500
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:54,318
spot but you know that there are um a

1501
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,039
number of companies that sell products

1502
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:59,440
um I guess you would call them

1503
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:01,920
soil amendments or plan enhancing

1504
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,639
products uh and it's unfair to ask this

1505
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,358
question but uh you you've talked about

1506
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:10,078
the biology of the soil and how

1507
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:12,838
important it is uh do you do you see any

1508
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:14,720
research that shows benefits of some of

1509
01:07:12,838 --> 01:07:17,318
these

1510
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:20,759
products um in terms of products that

1511
01:07:17,318 --> 01:07:25,000
are that are um you know more commercial

1512
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:28,160
products um that are sold at maybe like

1513
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,838
the regional or national level um you

1514
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:34,038
know not very much I mean you know the

1515
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:36,679
um if if the soil is low in in organic

1516
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:38,920
matter content there are are a number of

1517
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:42,719
ways to address that you know say

1518
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:45,079
compost sometimes if you have uh manure

1519
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,519
that's available say from a nearby dairy

1520
01:07:45,079 --> 01:07:51,559
farm or some other livestock Farm uh

1521
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:53,880
that can be very beneficial as well uh

1522
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:57,278
products that are more commercially sold

1523
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:59,480
uh you know some humic assets are sold I

1524
01:07:57,278 --> 01:08:01,719
haven't seen any research really that

1525
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:04,278
supports that in in a very significant

1526
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:07,239
way and and I would say I would want to

1527
01:08:04,278 --> 01:08:10,119
compare that with say you know a compost

1528
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:14,038
application uh you sometimes hear about

1529
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:17,640
remineralizing soils be mineralizing

1530
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:19,759
it's a kind of a diff difficult word um

1531
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:22,279
where um where basically that's more

1532
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:25,560
geologic material is it's is being

1533
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:27,839
added that will only be uh you can only

1534
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:31,679
justify that if you if you really do

1535
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:33,039
have uh deficiencies in uh in some of

1536
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:35,920
these plant

1537
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:38,000
nutrients a lot of times it's it's uh

1538
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,239
much easier to address that with

1539
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,560
fertilizer if you're organic producer

1540
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:45,000
and that's not an option you really want

1541
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:47,679
to do some C testing first and see

1542
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,399
whether those those elements are really

1543
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:54,239
limiting before you buy something like

1544
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:56,198
that and in the meantime Vern has a

1545
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:59,000
question are there practical ways to

1546
01:08:56,198 --> 01:09:02,639
optimize micro rizy and Berry plantings

1547
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,600
other than avoiding high PE and

1548
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:08,000
tillage

1549
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:09,960
um burn I think this is uh I'm getting

1550
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,399
on thin eyes here it's it's a little bit

1551
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,399
beyond my my expertise when it comes to

1552
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:17,559
Berry

1553
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:20,519
plantings um typically having a a

1554
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:21,480
healthy soil with with with good biology

1555
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:25,679
will

1556
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:28,079
basically um favor the development of of

1557
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:30,480
Ry in in a system that's that's not

1558
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:32,880
Disturbed basically once you have that

1559
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:36,278
established uh I believe there are

1560
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:39,719
inoculant being sold uh but

1561
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:41,480
um I you know i' really have to find out

1562
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:43,279
actually I'm not an expert on that

1563
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:46,759
perhaps some other people that are in

1564
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:48,440
here maybe Marvin britz maybe knows that

1565
01:09:46,759 --> 01:09:50,880
people who have a little bit more

1566
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:53,358
management experience with

1567
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,760
this B perhaps you know you know

1568
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:58,880
yourself uh I know Marvin is is is

1569
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,880
typing right

1570
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:13,360
now and while we're waiting for them to

1571
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:15,960
respond I think we'll switch to

1572
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:20,960
the last screen that we have for you to

1573
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:22,960
view today and encourage you all um to

1574
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:26,198
uh attend future meetings that we're

1575
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:28,719
having coming up here

1576
01:10:26,198 --> 01:10:31,678
and if you haven't already filled out

1577
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,719
the demographics or the pretest please

1578
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,600
do

1579
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:38,840
so and and I can see that Marvin's

1580
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:41,000
response is here um not aware of any

1581
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:44,480
strong data indicating that these

1582
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:47,000
inoculant work especially in healthy

1583
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:49,439
soils I do want to thank our presenter

1584
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:53,158
Harold vaness thank you very much

1585
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:56,039
Harold you're welcome our pleasure and I

1586
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:59,158
want to uh tell you that the next

1587
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:02,439
portion of this uh series is next week

1588
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:05,079
on October 14th from 2: to 3:15 in the

1589
01:11:02,439 --> 01:11:06,879
afternoon it will be Janet Fallon she'll

1590
01:11:05,079 --> 01:11:08,920
be talking to us about soil sampling

1591
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:11,279
procedures and soil

1592
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:15,560
testing uh with

1593
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:15,559
that we're going to be signing

1594
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:24,158
off I will mention uh this one last

1595
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:26,000
comment here uh from Glen ker and he's

1596
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:28,279
talking about perennial CR such as fruit

1597
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,679
trees a general guideline about

1598
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:33,559
balancing between use of inorganic

1599
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:35,560
versus compost as a source for soil

1600
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:38,480
nutrient management thank you very much

1601
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:40,560
Glenn right and with that I'm going to

1602
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:43,599
uh end the

1603
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,360
session I do want to say to you uh I'm

1604
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,360
going to leave this open so that you can

1605
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:50,960
download both the demographics and the

1606
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:53,000
preest uh take the time to do that and

1607
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:55,639
or if you want to check out the web

1608
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,639
links link up to them save them for

1609
01:11:55,639 --> 01:11:58,920
future

1610
01:11:56,639 --> 01:12:02,760
reference uh and I hope to see you uh

1611
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:02,760
next week thank you very

1612
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:27,158

Jeff and Harold I want to thank you both

1617
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,360
you did a great job

1618
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:12,189
[Music]

1619
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:18,520
can you hear me Cassy

1620
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:21,279
yes okay I I sorry I had already loged

1621
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:24,320
off and U I had somebody outside the

1622
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:26,319
door uh but yeah I did it go well did it

1623
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:30,319
uh I I know I was a little concerned

1624
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:32,679
that I was a little rushed or um or was

1625
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:35,960
it not the case no I thought it was

1626
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:37,480
great and I I took tons of notes so

1627
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:40,719
there was plent there was plenty of time

1628
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:45,718
to think about things and

1629
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:48,399
whatever okay ex great excellent good

1630
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:51,039
thank you so much I hope it set the

1631
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:52,920
stage for uh all all those other women

1632
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:55,920
Arts that are going to be following

1633
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,920
absolutely

1634
01:15:56,679 --> 01:15:59,679
absolutely

1635
01:16:00,279 --> 01:16:05,359
okay Jeff if you're talking to us we

1636
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,360
can't hear you for some

1637
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:23,760
reason okay I'm I am I'm going to log

1638
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,960
off then all right thanks so much Harold

1639
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:30,039
thanks a lot yeah I I'm glad it went

1640
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:33,039
well it was it was fantastic great thank

1641
01:16:30,039 --> 01:16:33,039
you

1642
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:39,238
okay Jeff I still can't hear you are you

1643
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:42,719
there oh yeah I was answering a question

1644
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:45,279
from room D oh

1645
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:48,359
okay hey uh yeah it went pretty well
