1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:27,590

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:34,370

5
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:36,049
students to work and study abroad for at

6
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:40,728
least a half year or sometimes a year

7
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:44,228
the year a half past two cities our

8
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:50,500
interests abroad and it's a great award

9
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:50,500
and so I started

10
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:33,939
we're set in mariposa counties Thank You

11
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,949
Nina so this is me paying up one of the

12
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:38,200
conditions of the jury reward is to give

13
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,629
a talk once you've been back and because

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,579
of the timing of my employment after my

15
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:44,140
Master's I kind of had a high tail it in

16
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:45,670
August when there weren't students

17
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,590
around so I was thankful for the

18
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,239
opportunity to come back here at this

19
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,240
time of year and talk to you all about

20
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:54,129
what I did so this will be the first of

21
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,310
many Lord of the Rings references so

22
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:59,348
brace yourself but this is my story of

23
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,310
there and back again a juror word tale

24
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:04,750
by Lindsey Jordan so I've wanted to go

25
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,640
to New Zealand since i virtually can

26
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,098
remember my father went when he was

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,560
around 15 it was with a rotary exchange

28
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:13,689
kind of program he went and stayed in

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,430
Rotorua with a new zealand family and so

30
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:17,378
I grew up hearing tales of how awesome

31
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,689
new zealand was and i always wanted to

32
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:21,549
go I also grew up loving penguins and

33
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:23,770
found out the home of little blue fairy

34
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,390
penguins or little blue penguins is New

35
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:29,099
Zealand so since I could pretty much

36
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:32,500
walk I wanted to go see penguins

37
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:33,729
similarly to say I was slightly obsessed

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,860
with Lord of the Rings when I was in

39
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:39,759
high school is an understatement I saw

40
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:42,340
each film eight times and theaters so to

41
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,500
say that New Zealand is the home of Lord

42
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,120
of the Rings I had wanted to go I

43
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,889
desperately wanted to go in fact when I

44
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,330
was around 18 19 when I graduated high

45
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:51,458
school and I thought oh instead of going

46
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,170
to do the European backpack thing i'll

47
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,729
go through New Zealand i'll drive around

48
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:56,530
and see all the sights I was dead set on

49
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:58,299
doing this and my parents sort of look

50
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,269
at me kind of concerned more for the

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,609
nerdiness than my safety and ultimately

52
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:06,640
though you can't rent a car until you're

53
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:07,569
25 so I was 19 and I said damn it i will

54
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,128
go to

55
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:13,479
zeeland when I'm 25 and drive around I

56
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:16,358
didn't realize how perfect that life

57
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,669
plan was going to end up I happen to get

58
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:20,560
into one of the industry's where New

59
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:22,059
Zealand is a very relevant thing the New

60
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,979
Zealand wine industry is quite famous

61
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,199
for its savvy on Blanc production

62
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:28,268
there's many other smaller regions that

63
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:31,179
are emerging for their cooler climate

64
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:33,849
style Pinot Noir and other varietals and

65
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,260
it's quite known in the world of wine so

66
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:37,298
I happen to be fortunate enough to have

67
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:40,060
this desire and passion to go to New

68
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,950
Zealand and the career to back it up so

69
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,139
and I had to choose a location for the g

70
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:46,628
reward I was sort of flopping and

71
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:48,609
flipping around the idea of Australia vs

72
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:50,768
new zealand I knew I'd be gone about six

73
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:53,079
months which isn't quite enough time to

74
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:54,430
do two countries justice and I just

75
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,650
thought this was going to be the time to

76
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,549
pursue my dream of going to New Zealand

77
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:03,060
so I did so this all started Cloudy Bay

78
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,169
is probably the most famous labels in

79
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,609
New Zealand they're famous for their

80
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:08,290
sabe on Blanc of the mall borough region

81
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:09,969
I remember seeing this exact label

82
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,798
presented on a screen much like this and

83
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:13,989
my intro to wines class at Davis and

84
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,509
once again had that thought of well I

85
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,548
should go there one day so to give you

86
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:20,229
an idea there are several wine regions

87
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:22,750
in New Zealand and you'll hear me talk

88
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:26,110
about a lot of them over the course of

89
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:28,509
my travels there's a tiny concentrated

90
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,020
area in the north part of the North

91
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:34,120
Island near auckland and my he ki Island

92
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:37,120
kind of premium very small production

93
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,310
they're the kind of other bigger more

94
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,470
famous regions are the Hawke's Bay

95
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,720
region you know the cities of Napier and

96
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,000
Hastings they're really developing quite

97
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,820
a reputation for their sera you have

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,740
Blenheim the city which is in the mall

99
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:52,899
borough region which is the bulk of

100
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,968
where the wine you've probably heard of

101
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:57,698
comes from it is the king of savvy on

102
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:58,810
blanc in the country you also have wines

103
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,509
going to the Canterbury region around

104
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,009
christchurch and there's also quite a

105
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:05,530
reputation for Pinot developing down

106
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:07,598
near the queenstown o tago peninsula

107
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:09,819
region so you'll hear me mention these

108
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,899
but the idea is to know that New Zealand

109
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:13,329
has several distinct wine-growing

110
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:15,579
regions with different varietals kind of

111
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:17,259
indifferent popularity in each I've

112
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:19,300
quite enjoyed New Zealand wines ever

113
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:21,250
since that kind of went down this path

114
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,728
and it was a really awesome experience

115
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,059
to

116
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:28,478
to explore all these regions on my own

117
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:30,069
so I kind of traveled the QE way I

118
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,188
booked a ticket and said I'll figure it

119
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:34,270
out one in there so I landed in Auckland

120
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:36,338
and that's where my journey kind of

121
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:37,688
started my first day I bought a car

122
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:39,009
turns out you don't actually need a

123
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:41,080
rent-a-car in New Zealand if you're

124
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:43,689
there for over a couple months there's a

125
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:45,218
very large second-hand car market from

126
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:46,599
Asia that comes in so it's actually much

127
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:47,978
more common for it through there for any

128
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:50,079
significant amount of time to just by

129
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:51,758
kind of a clunker that's what I did I

130
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,288
landed I probably hadn't slept in 36

131
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,468
hours I said let's go buy a vehicle

132
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:58,120
because that's a great idea I was taught

133
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:59,439
by a really wonderful little Maori man

134
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,689
how to drive on the other side of the

135
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,460
road to I was taken up and around

136
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:05,409
Auckland given a view of the city all

137
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:07,408
while trying to not be paralyzed in fear

138
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:09,399
of driving on the road side of the road

139
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:11,558
you'll see a recurring theme of this

140
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,509
presentation is penguins at all costs I

141
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:16,740
saw penguins every single time I could

142
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:19,088
so there's a Kelly Tarleton aquarium in

143
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,610
Auckland and I got to see some king

144
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:23,319
penguins there and I also took part of a

145
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,669
high tea which is very classic New

146
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,649
Zealand thing to do I don't know if

147
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:28,538
anybody saw Chinese presentation but

148
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:29,978
it's kind of the English influence on

149
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:31,628
New Zealand culture high tea especially

150
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:33,310
in Auckland is a quite enjoyable

151
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:35,499
experience so I've got to play the

152
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,620
tourist a little bit I then made my way

153
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:41,949
up to fenger a whs pronounced f as I

154
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,019
discovered in New Zealand up to what's

155
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:45,930
called the Northland this area is a

156
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:48,098
little more I won't call it tropical but

157
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,199
subtropical kind of climate quite warm

158
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:51,248
and humid this is ocean beach this is

159
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,889
where i spent my New Year's Eve

160
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:55,979
welcoming in 2014 a day earlier than all

161
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,569
of you here because of the time change

162
00:06:55,978 --> 00:07:00,370
all I can say is this is one of many

163
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,439
many many beautiful pictures of New

164
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,478
Zealand and it was an awesome experience

165
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:06,430
to get to celebrate the change of the

166
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,168
year so I'm gonna have a question I

167
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,329
wrote it on the team at Davis all four

168
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:11,978
years my undergrad and where else in New

169
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,778
Zealand could I say that I went swimming

170
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:15,459
with a horse we went down we change the

171
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:17,740
swimsuits went down into that water the

172
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:20,139
pacific view see right there then had a

173
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,908
picnic lunch with Savion block out on

174
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,788
the Sun so I can say is I had some fun

175
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:26,649
on this trip as well and this is finger

176
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:28,120
a Falls lots and lots of waterfalls

177
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:31,088
throughout New Zealand this is kind of a

178
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,519
you know picturesque every tourist goes

179
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:35,050
to see whangarei falls in this region on

180
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,439
a horticultural note this is also the

181
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,780
region

182
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,819
I made out of hike to see the Kauri tree

183
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:41,589
carry trees don't grow incredibly tall

184
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,870
they don't have any branches kind of

185
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:45,669
below anywhere below the very crown of

186
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,439
the tree they grow to be incredibly old

187
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,840
these old growth trees are kind of a

188
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,459
sight to behold and their height and

189
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,259
their age and they're very well

190
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,609
protected in New Zealand and because

191
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:56,230
they have a very shallow routing system

192
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,090
they actually often build a little

193
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,650
boardwalk planks to go around the tree

194
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:01,479
so you can go up to them without

195
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:03,370
damaging the fragile root system below

196
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,230
so I was fortunate enough to go out on a

197
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,000
few hikes kind of out in the middle of

198
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,500
nowhere you in New Zealand it's very

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,240
frequent to have trails go through

200
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,589
farmland so you kind of look your

201
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,750
tromping in the middle of a you know

202
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:15,399
sheep pen and you're looking for the

203
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,040
next trail marker so I followed a couple

204
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:19,120
of those to go see kauri trees

205
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,580
additionally I stopped at my very first

206
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,439
winery the Northland while not a super

207
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:25,149
famous region for wine these days is one

208
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,920
of the very first regions planted in New

209
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:28,569
Zealand probably due to its proximity to

210
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,330
Auckland and early English settlement

211
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:33,069
but Longview wines was kind of fun at

212
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:36,069
the tasting room there i found out of

213
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,260
the winemaker son had actually gone to

214
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,660
East the eastern institute of technology

215
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:42,849
or EIT who I was going to be helping out

216
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,799
on a research project with so realizing

217
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:46,060
the kind of influence of EIT graduates

218
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,709
throughout the country was kind of fun

219
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:51,039
very early on that's a very nice

220
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,300
Chardonnay that I enjoyed so Carrie

221
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,730
Carrie is where I swim with the horses a

222
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:56,409
little more north of finger a made my

223
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,000
way back down to the kind of the first

224
00:08:56,409 --> 00:09:01,269
true wine region I visited in New

225
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,210
Zealand which is why he Key Island this

226
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:06,579
is sort of a destination get away from

227
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,470
Auckland tourist spot these days very

228
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,320
desirable white sand beaches but also

229
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,120
has quite a large but a cultural

230
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,260
presence you take a little ferry over

231
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,840
from Auckland get a great view of the

232
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:18,429
city on your way out and this vineyard

233
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,680
in particular I'd like to make note of

234
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:22,539
it's called Jurassic Ridge this guy has

235
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:24,489
a degree in geology he hires a few

236
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:25,779
viticultural consultants as well his

237
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,339
wines are spot-on he did a really

238
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:29,169
amazing multiplet giano and some of

239
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:31,570
those other Italian warmer climate Reds

240
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:33,429
this island gets a lot warmer but has

241
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,860
some wint has a lot of wind coming off

242
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:37,120
of the ocean and has humidity issues so

243
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,339
it was kind of a very interesting

244
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,720
climate to be growing some grapes but

245
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:42,370
they were pretty there are some pretty

246
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,290
spectacular wines but that being said

247
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,820
it's a huge tourist destination this is

248
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:46,809
the view from cable bay vineyards which

249
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,970
is famous for having a nice little

250
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:51,369
luncheon I did partake in

251
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,569
and we had like I said big white sand

252
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,100
beaches the coolest part about the way i

253
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:56,708
did this is there was a pass you got

254
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,610
with the ferry which is you paid you

255
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,799
hopped on the ferry and there was a

256
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,789
little vineyard bus that took you on a

257
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,378
little loop of all the different

258
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:04,059
wineries and I did the math and I could

259
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:05,740
have hit about five so I hit all five

260
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:08,409
that I could but there's actually plenty

261
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,209
more than that but it's you know it's a

262
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:11,740
day it's a day trip it's an overnight

263
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,719
trip for a lot of Aucklanders and

264
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,089
there's sort of this tourism that drives

265
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,670
I think the local wine of commercial

266
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,899
industry and it was a beautiful location

267
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:24,068
is all I can say and some very

268
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:25,480
interesting wines run there so after

269
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:27,458
making my way back down from Waikiki

270
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,009
Island I made a stop in Hobbiton before

271
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:31,688
heading down to the center so hobbiton

272
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:35,500
this was this was going to happen it's

273
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:37,929
actually happen twice so and I realized

274
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,438
that basically her Fred students are

275
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:44,289
hobbits we grow things and we like

276
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:46,778
drinking beer so honestly it was like

277
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:48,309
Rica muting with my people what's cool

278
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,809
about hobbiton that I should note is

279
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:51,489
they actually have full year round

280
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:53,619
gardeners and they actually garden the

281
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,079
location the little farm lands they have

282
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,149
in plots to be in season with you know

283
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,250
with the climate and that's a compost

284
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:03,278
pile right there so they actually do

285
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,899
sort of make an effort to maintain it

286
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,088
looking like it was an actual little

287
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:11,318
agricultural farming community among

288
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:14,079
hobbits paid gardeners from the facility

289
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:15,578
so it's a paid tour the site is actually

290
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,289
owned by a sheep farmer there they have

291
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:19,088
quite a large number a head of sheep in

292
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:22,328
its a sheets are all surrounding sheep

293
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:24,610
farm and then New Line Cinema agreed to

294
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:26,019
leave the Hobbit holes behind when they

295
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,399
left when they made more of the Rings

296
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,649
they actually stripped out most of them

297
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,750
you could kind of see like circles of

298
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,948
hobbit hole doors in the in the dirt but

299
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,139
it was nothing like this but when they

300
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:36,549
did the hobbit they rebuilt it up and

301
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:37,990
the owners of the farm said please leave

302
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:39,729
everything because they were already

303
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,289
running tours but this was actually like

304
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:45,220
a thousand times better than just having

305
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:47,740
some plywood doors so it's everything

306
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,930
and like I said that's bag n from the

307
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,818
movie if any of you recognize and it's

308
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:54,039
fantastic I also want to make a note in

309
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:55,568
the lower corner there that's a chicory

310
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:57,009
plant chicory was one of my undermined

311
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:59,139
cover crops I grew here and I such

312
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,428
Hickory everywhere in New Zealand so I

313
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:02,159
don't know sort of like your work

314
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,480
follows you no matter where you go but

315
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,799
so I thought that was sort of an

316
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,370
interesting note has beautiful purple

317
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:10,099
flowers so so I then have made my way

318
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,440
down to the center of the country where

319
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,509
I'm traveling alone and I'm not a

320
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,579
particularly avid hiker but I said damn

321
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:19,050
it I'm going to climb Mount Doom this is

322
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:21,719
matt mauro hawaii it's part of the

323
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:23,188
tongue guerrero state park there's a

324
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,170
really really famous day hike it's about

325
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:28,259
10 hour day hike called the trigger euro

326
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:29,909
alpine crossing this is a sub route you

327
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:31,528
can decide to take off and that's where

328
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:33,389
all I really cared about doing so most

329
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:34,500
people have a bus drop them off at the

330
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,970
beginning of the day they hike this

331
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,919
whole crossing I get picked up the end I

332
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,100
said nope i'm going to hike up in roa

333
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,370
your mount doom and hike back so they

334
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,110
describe the chunga rio crossing as

335
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,060
difficult very difficult and i will say

336
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,289
there's a lot of hiking and stairs and

337
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,878
mountain climbing you climb up you know

338
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:53,639
some good elevation and you got some

339
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,159
good miles under you they describe the

340
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,139
sub trail climbing up nara hoey is also

341
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,269
difficult that's like comparing

342
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,399
community college art class to cornell

343
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:05,129
engineering there are different levels

344
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,990
of difficult so I that is a picture I

345
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:09,688
would have turned to my left to take

346
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:12,000
when I was climbing or rock climbing my

347
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:13,948
arms hurt the next day I also be in the

348
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,870
worrywart I am packed my bag with like

349
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:18,448
the 20 pounds of like extra rain gear

350
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,220
and water and snacks just in case all

351
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:23,549
the stuff happens if they warn you about

352
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:28,379
so I'm alone climbing up a four hour

353
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:29,729
hike in that but I did it I did it and I

354
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,740
wasn't probably never prouder of myself

355
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:35,519
I didn't have a ring to throw in it but

356
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,409
at that point I called it a day and then

357
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,769
of course so that's the descent it's

358
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:42,120
more like skiing than it is um hiking

359
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:43,438
but I can say I did it it was one of

360
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,839
those like I had to do before I die

361
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:47,879
things and I can say I did it so that's

362
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,519
an arrow hwy up says three hours that's

363
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,500
probably true if you were unfit and

364
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,448
carrying 20 pounds of gear but there is

365
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,740
no actual trail you just kind of can see

366
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:57,179
those white lines or sort of the rough

367
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,759
guide lines that you make to make your

368
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,019
way up there but I had to do it and I'm

369
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,068
very glad to say i did it and i never

370
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,990
need to do it again so from so you can

371
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:10,019
see tongariro national park is the

372
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:12,149
southern region below the lake and then

373
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,350
there's lake taupo that large like right

374
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:15,149
in the center of the north island and

375
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,050
tap over the cute little town and then

376
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:17,970
from there kind of

377
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:21,269
Mountains over to the Hawke's Bay region

378
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:23,040
to Napier and the kind of more in a

379
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:25,350
culturally important town of Hastings I

380
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,838
was very very fortunate to have a

381
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,550
connection from my Davis days dr. mark

382
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,320
krasnow worked in the lab of Mark

383
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:33,419
Matthews when I was undergrad doing

384
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,850
undergraduate research there and I have

385
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,078
a glee knew he was in New Zealand and I

386
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,000
sort of reached out to him around the

387
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:42,389
time of the jury reward that I heard and

388
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,220
I said hey I'm going to be a new zealand

389
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:45,838
I'd love to help out with something I

390
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,950
don't know what you're doing I don't

391
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,000
know you know currently research I know

392
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,220
you were doing some cost resetting

393
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,600
research love to hear from you since hey

394
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,980
Lindsay actually stopped the cluster

395
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,930
thinning research what we're doing a lot

396
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,720
of work on right now is under vine

397
00:14:54,929 --> 00:15:00,809
management treatments for sustainable

398
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,509
practices which is basically the basis

399
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:06,389
of what my thesis was here at Cornell so

400
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:09,600
I was like well that was convenient so I

401
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:11,250
agreed to help out on the project that

402
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,290
had there's two sites of this project

403
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,940
one in the Hawke's Bay and one in the

404
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:16,139
mall borough region I was going to be

405
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,519
helping out at the sister site in

406
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,889
Marlborough that's where i was going to

407
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,839
be based but I obviously stopped up at

408
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:23,490
Hawke's Bay marc krauss no has since

409
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,160
left and he's now teaching actually a

410
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,778
kind of wine and integrated viticulture

411
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,139
course for the culinary institute down

412
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:33,720
in New Jersey but his successor dr coeur

413
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:36,000
MO you can see her she's the one in the

414
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:41,070
blue shirt she's taken over the project

415
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,509
and she was very amazingly welcoming and

416
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,339
on the project you can see one of her

417
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,480
students Ashley there they were working

418
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,589
on a slightly different project but I

419
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,690
went out in the field with them for a

420
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:50,820
couple days and help take data it's a

421
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,990
really cool piece of data that they're

422
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,920
doing in that upper right hand corner

423
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:59,129
right there it's as opposed to doing the

424
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,360
rather time-consuming epq a that just

425
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:03,059
means a very big fan of and that i know

426
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,980
i've taken a ton of this is others

427
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:07,169
researchers in spain that have developed

428
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,870
a rough software program that basically

429
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:11,370
if you put a whiteboard with good enough

430
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,810
light so there's not too many shadows

431
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,220
that's always the trick is catching the

432
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:15,899
right light clouds or your friend for

433
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,610
this piece of data we put a whiteboard

434
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,078
up and put this frame they have a

435
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,550
program that will roughly count the

436
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,828
number of green pixels to white pixels

437
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:24,539
and four in New Zealand especially

438
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:26,159
looking at the number of percent gaps in

439
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:27,509
a canopy caused by a treatment it's

440
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,610
important you're looking to see is

441
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:30,809
something super super d vigor

442
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,610
getting these vines or these vines

443
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:35,578
taking a punch by having vegetation

444
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,919
underneath or actually in the projects I

445
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,299
was helping out with in Hawke's Bay for

446
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,949
a couple days it was in a very

447
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:43,049
interesting project because water is

448
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,480
included in your taxes in New Zealand

449
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:48,319
growers have the luxury of being able to

450
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,480
basically water when and what they want

451
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,899
so there hasn't been a whole lot of

452
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,670
actual water stress measurements and

453
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,980
correlations to their soil moisture

454
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:00,629
meters like saying California where

455
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,129
water is very restrictive we know a lot

456
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:03,600
more on that end so one of these

457
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:06,029
projects was literally looking at

458
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,068
commercial vineyard sites that had soil

459
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:09,750
moisture probes and correlating them to

460
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,699
the pre-dawn and midday stand water

461
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,169
potentials of the vine so that these

462
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,519
growers have a better tool of

463
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:15,929
understanding what these soil moisture

464
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,818
readings are actually relating to win

465
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:20,189
their vine before it sort of was like oh

466
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:22,529
it reached this level sure I should

467
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:25,589
probably irrigate so that was one of the

468
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:26,789
projects and like I said we went around

469
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:28,678
to multiple commercial vineyards where

470
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:29,819
this project was going on that bottom

471
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,519
right-hand corner that's actually the

472
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:33,539
student vineyard on the EIT campus and I

473
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,980
want to make note it's actually just

474
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:36,808
been mowed but at the bottom and that

475
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,048
inner Oh cover crop is actually chicory

476
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:41,548
so there is a student a former student

477
00:17:40,048 --> 00:17:44,129
named Steve wheeler who'd hit his

478
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:46,950
master's looking at using trickery and

479
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,630
in two rows of vineyards I've must have

480
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,730
referenced his paper I don't even know

481
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:52,980
how many times in my own work looking at

482
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,470
chicory in under vine rose and I was

483
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,029
actually fortunate enough to meet him

484
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,798
the people at EIT connected me with him

485
00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:00,178
and I got to meet him and talk with him

486
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,789
about his work and what he's doing now

487
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,500
so that was a very kind of fun academia

488
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:06,119
circle moment to close the gap to meet

489
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,339
the man whose paper I referenced at

490
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:12,569
least a dozen times and as you can see

491
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:14,730
chicory actually is used not it wasn't

492
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:16,139
you know everywhere but I certainly did

493
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,349
see it being intentionally used as an

494
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:22,080
interim cover crop in New Zealand so

495
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:23,250
this was the site the sister site of

496
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,960
website I would be working on the

497
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,029
project basically there were three

498
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,650
different under vine treatments that's

499
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:31,259
me out at elephant hill there were

500
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:34,230
actually two sites at to commercial

501
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:35,519
vineyards in both merlot and Syrah and

502
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,048
the Hawke's Bay which are kind of the

503
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,569
important varietals for those regions

504
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:41,789
and you can see here there's this

505
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:43,349
awesome signage that would explain when

506
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:45,359
treatments start and stopped because

507
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:48,058
New Zealand it's very very common to

508
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,649
hire individual contractors to do most

509
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:51,509
of your vineyard maintenance so I'm in

510
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,340
this right I'll hire my spray contractor

511
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:55,349
oh I need cultivation under the vine or

512
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:57,418
herbicide application all higher that

513
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:59,490
contractor so it's a lot of this sort of

514
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:00,960
piecemeal labor work so anyways they

515
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,730
were hiring contractors to do their

516
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,110
maintenance under vines so there's sort

517
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,179
of very nice labeling out in the field

518
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,740
and it's actually the elephant Hill

519
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,929
sites are really famous and beautiful

520
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,009
winery in the Hawke's Bay region so it's

521
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:13,890
kind of fun to get to see a research

522
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:15,179
project out there and just to note you

523
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,500
can see the sign on the right here

524
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,690
that's this little logo about New

525
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,279
Zealand sustainable wine-growing to

526
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,038
enter any wine competition in New

527
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:25,710
Zealand you must have the certification

528
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:28,679
so there's a lot of push to maintain

529
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:31,259
these sort of internal sustainability

530
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,400
standards and meet this labeling kind of

531
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:33,750
regulation if you want to call it

532
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,700
because it lets you enter wine

533
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,288
competitions so I thought that was a

534
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,610
really cool movement to see within New

535
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:40,769
Zealand and see it widespread in New

536
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:43,288
Zealand since I think sustainable

537
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:45,990
labeling shifting to meeting the needs

538
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:47,519
for a specific region and climate is a

539
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,359
really important thing in Middle culture

540
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,099
so I thought that was a cool thing to

541
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,619
see and I've note all the shooting signs

542
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:54,689
birds are a huge problem in New Zealand

543
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:55,709
birds are huge problem in New Zealand

544
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,650
the only place I've seen a Morse as long

545
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,900
island actually but um so they literally

546
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,809
put someone with blanks and a you know

547
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,280
normally a pump action on the back of an

548
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:07,558
8th ed or truck and drive around

549
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,210
different blocks shooting because it's

550
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:10,649
one of the best bird scare tactics they

551
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,819
have so when they actually say shooting

552
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,960
they're not just talking bird cannons

553
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:16,109
they actually means someone in the back

554
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,610
of a truck shooting a shotgun so that's

555
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:18,839
that's always sort of fun they would use

556
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:19,769
real shells they said and take the birds

557
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,220
up but they're worried about the lead

558
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:25,019
content in the vineyard so because it's

559
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,460
birds are a huge problem in fact you can

560
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,408
see I'm there early enough in the season

561
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,970
that these aren't netted yet as soon as

562
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:31,530
we're raisin so when the berries start

563
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,089
to soften and accumulate sugar and turn

564
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:34,319
color in the case of the red varieties

565
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:36,240
through the hip arrays and those Nets

566
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,589
have to go up because otherwise that's

567
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,808
going to just be a nice little lunch for

568
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:41,699
a bird so these are the women who

569
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:44,190
wonderfully hosted me and showed me

570
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,200
around while I was a TI t that's moving

571
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:49,320
from left to right that's ting ting

572
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,230
that's dr coeur MO ashley her student

573
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,908
myself and dr. patrick king i felt very

574
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,710
very fortunate to have these amazing

575
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:57,149
women show me around and this was sort

576
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,038
of an amazing round table dinner on my

577
00:20:57,148 --> 00:21:00,838
last night in town where we realized it

578
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,548
was you know five women of viticulture

579
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:04,200
all at one table all from around the

580
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:06,239
world which was sort of interesting and

581
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,219
awesome and so I'm very very grateful

582
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:09,509
for the opportunity experience they gave

583
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:11,460
me and how much I was able to learn

584
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:13,469
about the region and New Zealand wine

585
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,239
growing from them as well as welcome

586
00:21:13,469 --> 00:21:17,308
they welcomed me on helping them out on

587
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:18,960
a project so I'm very very thankful and

588
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:21,928
we'll take that moment to give a shout

589
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,608
out to that so I also apparently got

590
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:25,528
into the mountain climbing mobiles in

591
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:28,048
New Zealand which is so funny if you

592
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:29,749
know me but I decided to climb came out

593
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:31,888
of pique que mata peak is this sort of

594
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:33,719
mountain in the middle of the Hawke's

595
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:36,238
Bay region and that's me having ascended

596
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:38,369
the peak petrohue I was staying with had

597
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:40,200
some friends who kind of do this walk

598
00:21:38,368 --> 00:21:42,388
every more in every Sunday morning I

599
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,460
said sure I'll come walk up a mountain

600
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:46,079
hill I can do that well I ended up

601
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,179
breaking off with one of the men of the

602
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,978
group who I didn't know it but was had

603
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,710
formerly been like a professional like

604
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:54,210
race Walker and so took me up these

605
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,548
switchback hills where I thought I was

606
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,899
going to die but I did it and he

607
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,848
wonderfully took the photo for me and

608
00:21:57,898 --> 00:22:01,949
you can see sort of the beauty of this

609
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:04,108
vineyard an agricultural there's a lot

610
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:06,389
of apple production in this region to a

611
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:08,308
lot of stone fruits but that's the hawks

612
00:22:06,388 --> 00:22:09,868
bay and the river and it's just it's a

613
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:11,940
stunning region but i highly recommend

614
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:14,428
going i had some fantastic surahs' i

615
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,629
highly recommend the bullnose sera which

616
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:19,259
also happened to be one of the research

617
00:22:15,628 --> 00:22:21,148
sites for us so making my way from south

618
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:22,829
finally I did a little detour into

619
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:25,558
Martin borough they're a little tiny bit

620
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:27,808
of cultural area outside of Wellington

621
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:29,668
that capital Martin borough was actually

622
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:31,378
having it's like summer riesling event

623
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:32,519
so sort of funny that I traveled halfway

624
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:36,298
around the world to have a summer

625
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:38,069
Riesling but very small production very

626
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:39,450
boutique guys but some really cool

627
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:41,908
things going on there some completely

628
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,830
organic growers they're kind of doing

629
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:45,839
figuring their style out but it was a

630
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:47,908
fun little stop on the way and then

631
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:49,769
Wellington is quite famous for it has

632
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:52,049
this massive garden that you actually

633
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:53,729
take a cable car up to this very steep

634
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:55,019
hill fact if you go to the University

635
00:22:53,729 --> 00:22:56,969
there you take this cable car basically

636
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:59,219
to get to campus every day which is pic

637
00:22:56,969 --> 00:23:00,719
is kind of awesome and I happen to see

638
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:02,399
the hydrangeas in like full bloom I

639
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:03,269
happen to hit I was walking through and

640
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:04,678
happened to hit an outdoor music

641
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:07,669
concerts that they apparently do in the

642
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:10,100
summer all day or every every weekend

643
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:11,809
for most the afternoon

644
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:13,399
in the in the beautiful botanical garden

645
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,200
so I said sure I'll sit down for a free

646
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,610
outdoor concert so that was my little

647
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,410
experience in Wellington that was really

648
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:22,069
kind of awesome and amazing to see such

649
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:24,500
an amazing public garden there so to get

650
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:26,720
now sort of my North Island experience

651
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,509
time to head on south so you take the

652
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,160
ferry to get from the north of South

653
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:32,480
Island and it's actually kind of a

654
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,529
beautiful ride if you hit it during the

655
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,140
day because you go through the mall

656
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:38,178
borough sounds which is this sort of I

657
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,250
you can see this like Peninsula I you

658
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:42,288
Lindy part of the north part of the

659
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,359
South Island absolutely stunning ride in

660
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:45,950
and just to make a note pretty much

661
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,029
anything you're getting in New Zealand

662
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,740
because it will have been brought in to

663
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:50,839
Auckland if it's in the South Island

664
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,159
it's come on one of these fairies so all

665
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,689
the one that's made the South Island all

666
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,640
the mall borough South blanc is being

667
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,529
put onto trucks normally not in a bottle

668
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,720
form normally in a tanker form being

669
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:01,220
tankard across the ferry then driven up

670
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,470
to Auckland where it's been bottled all

671
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,048
your food all your products so it sort

672
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:08,058
of puts in perspective the enormous cost

673
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:09,319
of living in New Zealand but it was sort

674
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:10,849
of interesting to see that half the time

675
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:14,149
on the ferry you're more battling cargo

676
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:19,519
space and cargo room with trucks as well

677
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:21,650
as just passengers like myself well the

678
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,000
kid this is one of the apparently one of

679
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,559
the roughest patches of see the fairies

680
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,720
cross they will cancel the berries if it

681
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,158
gets too bad they only have a slow ferry

682
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,500
now they don't have a fast ferry anymore

683
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,210
in part because of the potentially rocky

684
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,250
waters I took it twice both times for

685
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,819
pretty smooth sailing but that is I

686
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,380
certainly have heard not always the case

687
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:41,689
so I did a quick detour so if you look

688
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,309
on the part of the South Island if you

689
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:47,058
kind of there's the city of Nelson you

690
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:49,069
went more West than that you'd see what

691
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:50,418
is abel tasman park I was told I when I

692
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:51,798
asking everyone I know who had been in

693
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:53,240
New Zealand what do I need to do

694
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:55,819
everyone says hands down abel tasman

695
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,808
book like first breath and then oh yeah

696
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:59,000
you can do these other things but

697
00:24:56,808 --> 00:25:00,288
everyone says abel tasman park and i

698
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,429
will give everyone this from the same

699
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:02,658
advice if you go to New Zealand do

700
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:04,490
anything but go to April tasman park

701
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:06,710
probably the most stunning thing you'll

702
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,298
see in your life you can do a whole hike

703
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,460
along the whole coast it takes four or

704
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:12,048
five days I did not do that because I

705
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,370
did not have the equipment or the time

706
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:15,589
because I was sort of sneaking this in

707
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:16,969
before i started my job but I did do a

708
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:18,649
little a couple day trips where they

709
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,450
have little boats go down to the various

710
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,070
little landings it's uninhabited this is

711
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,600
like a state park but it's quite

712
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:25,609
frequented by these boats and very

713
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,109
that take people there every day the

714
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:29,029
picture of that rock it's split apple

715
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,199
rock there's a big Maori mariya the

716
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:33,379
traditional people are the native

717
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,779
peoples of New Zealand there's a lot of

718
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,570
Maori legend about the acts of the Maori

719
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:40,339
warrior that carved that rock into but

720
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:41,928
you can kayak around that if you want I

721
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:44,439
mostly just hung out in the beach and

722
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:47,870
hiked and it's stunning Beach and forest

723
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,650
so all I can say is go to New Zealand go

724
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:53,058
to abel tasman so finally made it down

725
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,500
to mull borough the wine region that I

726
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:58,279
was going to be calling home for the

727
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:00,169
majority of my trip anyway most people

728
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:01,639
heard if you've heard of a wine from New

729
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:03,220
Zealand's I can almost guarantee its can

730
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,570
be a mole burrows to style South Blanc

731
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,710
in fact saying I should send to smoke

732
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:08,839
there i should say it's a mole grossed

733
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:11,269
out books marlborough sauvignon blanc

734
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,459
but moral style south blanc is now a

735
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:14,900
recognised style and New Zealand this

736
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,829
often means more green and herbaceous

737
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:20,269
you get fresh cut grass bell pepper but

738
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:22,460
also a lot of fruit I get a lot of

739
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:24,529
passion fruit off of a lot of the more

740
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,240
better than muldrow South blancs a lot

741
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:29,079
of bright citrus so it's as big

742
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,579
in-your-face grassy green fruity wine

743
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:34,939
decent levels of acid this is a cooler

744
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:36,859
ish climate it's a growing region you

745
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,090
can see here there's a lot of growers a

746
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:39,319
lot of growers that aren't attached to

747
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:41,269
wineries and this is an interesting

748
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:43,279
dynamic that i'll try to explain there's

749
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:46,038
a lot of contract wineries meaning your

750
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,589
big winery and your your space your

751
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:50,119
tanks and your labors sort of up for bid

752
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:52,069
by someone who wants to pay you to like

753
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,639
they contract out their wine here's my

754
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:56,928
fruit make wine out of it and in fact

755
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,240
the vast majority of labels you're going

756
00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:01,820
to see in the market don't have a

757
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,650
tasting room winery available in fact

758
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:05,839
there's very little class over of those

759
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,610
kind of wineries because New Zealand is

760
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:09,349
largely an export market most of their

761
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:11,509
wine is being taken out of their country

762
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:13,428
and it's meant for our shelves isn't you

763
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:17,298
know united state heavy export to United

764
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:20,419
States Sweden Canada Europe and so

765
00:27:17,298 --> 00:27:22,038
that's who they're marketing to and if

766
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:23,360
you're exporting your wine anyway might

767
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:24,650
as well pay some of those the facilities

768
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,629
to make your label and get it out of

769
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,580
there so there's lots of this still

770
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,470
contract growers so I'm a wine grape

771
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:31,849
grower and i sell my grapes to someone

772
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,700
looking to buy wines there's still a lot

773
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:36,230
of that going on some lots of growers

774
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,590
168 wineries in the region with over

775
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,819
six thousand acres sabi on Blanc is king

776
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:42,949
you can see it's over eighty five

777
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:45,529
percent of what's planted their lobby on

778
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,269
Blanc is where the demand is and what

779
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:49,279
the region is known for that being said

780
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:51,319
I think Pinot Noir grows very well there

781
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,690
and I think Pinot is starting to develop

782
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:55,428
quite the reputation in New Zealand it's

783
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,590
just my two cents but if you wanted to

784
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:59,240
you know get in early you'd see the

785
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:00,649
other varietals on there that make a bit

786
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,120
of an appearance chardonnay pinot gris

787
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,610
riesling there's a smattering of other

788
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:06,259
varieties at is VY help from one of the

789
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:07,909
wineries there for example so you see

790
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:11,298
the kind of a funny mix of stuff going

791
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:14,298
on but salve or as they call it savvy is

792
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:16,400
king and you can see per diem is the

793
00:28:14,298 --> 00:28:17,900
bulk of the acreage there so this is

794
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,309
sort of a little cutesy map you can get

795
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,790
but I definitely lived on a little bit

796
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:24,829
so the town of Blenheim kind of right

797
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:27,139
around here which is where I lived and

798
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:28,939
kind of where the actual city part is

799
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,860
and then you have this valley encompass

800
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,840
by two mountain ranges and this is the

801
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:34,789
mall Roe Valley and what's interesting

802
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:36,980
is they sort of sub divide it into three

803
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:38,539
little regions all of these are pretty

804
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,099
cool regions these are not reaching the

805
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:41,298
hot temperatures of Australia or

806
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:43,490
anything like that I'd say they're

807
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:45,859
warmer than maybe our summers here but

808
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:47,539
we're looking at what is considered a

809
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:48,979
cool climate viticulture it's one of the

810
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:51,079
reasons I was attracted of going to New

811
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,789
Zealand as well after having gotten

812
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:54,079
great experience in both California and

813
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:55,250
New York I was kind of looking for

814
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,720
someone a little bit more in between

815
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,160
someone a little bit different for

816
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,230
pulling upon some of the cool climate

817
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,240
experience in New York I was able to

818
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,759
understand the situation in New Zealand

819
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,819
a lot better that being said all of

820
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:09,890
these are dry compared to say the

821
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:11,659
Northeast they do get in season rainfall

822
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:13,850
however so this is these guys are going

823
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,460
to be wetter than California or

824
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:20,329
something like that but we're looking at

825
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,980
a comparatively dry climate to say like

826
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:22,879
the Northeast that being said I happen

827
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,980
to be there during one of the wettest

828
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,100
falls on record so I guess I brought it

829
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:30,740
with me so to give you a bit of

830
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:32,500
background at least in the Northeast

831
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,339
you're getting bud break around May in

832
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,380
California it's normally the first week

833
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:38,359
in april and then you kind of go through

834
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:41,419
brazen that ripening is happening August

835
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:43,308
or so harvesting september-october and

836
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:44,600
those leaves are going dormant or those

837
00:29:43,308 --> 00:29:47,658
mines are going dormant you're dropping

838
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:49,339
leaves in November everything switched a

839
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:49,530
little bit in the southern hemisphere so

840
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,759
that

841
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:53,399
stuffs starting to happen more like

842
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:55,200
September I arrived remember in December

843
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,400
January's that's when I was popping

844
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,559
around helping out with that EIT

845
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,269
research so those berries we're just

846
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,190
starting to go through brazen a little

847
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:03,660
bit after I got there those don't quite

848
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,730
line up there was more like februari

849
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,680
January that brazen was occurring and

850
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:10,500
then harvest is starting depending on

851
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,259
the varietal late februari in an earlier

852
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,940
mid-february but most likely early March

853
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:17,339
and then you're normally got everything

854
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,049
off the vine by May so there's sort of a

855
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:21,659
little cycle there that was kind of fun

856
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:25,829
to see and very disorienting when you

857
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:27,779
have three summers in a row so a very

858
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:29,549
interesting and cool Institute that New

859
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:31,649
Zealand has is plant food research they

860
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:33,690
have facilities up in Auckland but they

861
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:36,330
also have Amma blenheim station which

862
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:38,460
predominantly and makes sense focuses a

863
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:40,109
lot on grape and wine research they have

864
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,759
a little a research winery which they

865
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:42,869
did a lot of little micro fermentation

866
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,940
so that was really cool to see that

867
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:47,699
technology there's some cool stuff going

868
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,200
on I helped out with research for a

869
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,450
couple days to sort of see what was on

870
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,009
dr. demian Martin showed me around he

871
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,569
sort of the director there and it was

872
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:55,769
awesome to meet him and have him

873
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:58,710
introduced me to all the research

874
00:30:55,769 --> 00:31:01,200
scientists there and he's the one

875
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,910
connected me to helping out and kind of

876
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,319
you know following everyone around for

877
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,570
the day in that upper right hand corner

878
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,819
you can see that kind of computer and

879
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:10,919
that looks like a psycho I don't even

880
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:12,210
know she'll scanning thing it's the best

881
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,800
student best piece of technology I've

882
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,180
ever seen you throw berries at the

883
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:16,740
bottom and it counts the berries and

884
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,080
gives you size of berries so no more

885
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,970
hand counting berries so that was really

886
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:25,559
cool for comparing treatments to see if

887
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:27,120
it hadn't effect on Barry sizing at the

888
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,039
bottom left hand corner there was a

889
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,750
research scientist their DN mundi he's

890
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:35,819
awesome guy he was looking at a lot of

891
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:38,299
potential kind of paints as we call them

892
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:41,730
for treating wood against fungal

893
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:43,589
infections in the wind dormant season

894
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,360
prunings and so these are all has grown

895
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:46,829
up little samples to see which funguses

896
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,169
were growing within the presence of

897
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:51,240
these different applications and then

898
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,940
that's the lab of dr. Mike trot that I

899
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,200
was helping doing that very sorting with

900
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,430
he was really awesome he showed me

901
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,110
around kind of took me under his wing

902
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:00,060
and I'm really really thankful for all

903
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:01,589
of that he even invited me to a

904
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,159
traditional keva barbecue where I met

905
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:04,349
dr.

906
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,550
smart so I was really kind of fun but um

907
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:06,929
he showed me a couple of his trials

908
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,579
going on that potted one had to do with

909
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:12,390
nitrogen fertilization and the name is

910
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:14,279
doing another project that related leaf

911
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,390
removal and hurdling different shoots

912
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:17,309
and seeing nutrient transport

913
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,540
differences then he showed me a couple

914
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:20,730
of the research vineyards that they were

915
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:23,250
using so I was really really thankful to

916
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,690
get an idea of the research going on in

917
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:27,480
New Zealand in Marlborough you know

918
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:30,269
prime wine country with a plant food so

919
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,279
it's very thankful for that so the trial

920
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:36,389
that I was actually you know going there

921
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:38,339
to be a part of um so like I said that

922
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,450
we were the sister site to these trials

923
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:41,129
that were occurring in the Hawke's Bay

924
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:43,500
and we were looking at three different

925
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,000
treatments we were looking at mowing

926
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,259
under the vine so leaving whatever

927
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,180
plants wanted to grow there naturally

928
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:49,500
and just mowing them with a commercial

929
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,210
mower we looked at cultivating

930
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,920
underneath the vines the traditional

931
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,539
organic method of weed control and a

932
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,090
vineyard underneath the vines and we

933
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:59,069
looked at herbicide use and they were

934
00:32:57,089 --> 00:33:01,169
the exact same experimental designs as

935
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:02,700
in Hawke's Bay but we looked at sabi on

936
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,930
Blanc these kind of this projects are

937
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,059
kind in the middle of this bigger block

938
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:07,410
highlighted in green and in Pinot Noir

939
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,940
which are the two you know those are the

940
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,529
top varietals and for the mall borough

941
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:13,170
region so we thought we'd look at them

942
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:15,509
for that so we took a lot of data I

943
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:17,930
helped out with at least some of it my

944
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:20,129
friend Chris Williams was sort of the

945
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,930
I'm gonna call him undergraduate

946
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,400
although he's older than me helping out

947
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,259
on the project and then I came along and

948
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,900
kind of helped him out too we did a lot

949
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:29,190
of leaf area so what you do is you pick

950
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,210
and sort out all those leaves cut off

951
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,769
the petioles and then feed them through

952
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,360
the scanner which gives you the leaf

953
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:35,220
areas and that ended up being a very

954
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,629
interesting piece of data looking at how

955
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,400
those were affected by those under find

956
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,840
treatments we took timeline photos the

957
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,460
vineyard to look at the establishment

958
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,199
and weed growth of you know the regrowth

959
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,569
back after you've cultivated something

960
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,460
or after you to apply to herbicide we

961
00:33:45,569 --> 00:33:49,109
did typical petiole nutrient analysis

962
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,660
see how that's affecting we do those

963
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:53,490
canopy photos that I had talked about

964
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,110
earlier we looked at percent shaded area

965
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,750
underneath the vine it's kind of another

966
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:58,769
correlation to canopy sighs you know if

967
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,539
you have lots of big canopy you're

968
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:02,549
creating more shade on the ground then

969
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:04,710
we did normal maturity sampling lots of

970
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:07,500
maturity sampling every week just about

971
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:10,139
every other week we were sampling from

972
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,630
each on experimental unit 100 berries

973
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:14,429
and looking at all the traditional sugar

974
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,539
and acid levels looking at nutrient

975
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:18,030
level used to swimmable my

976
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:19,559
Georgian we also collected samples at

977
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,960
both for raised in that ripening period

978
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:24,090
and at harvest time for we used a gross

979
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,039
gas chromatography to look at methoxy

980
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,809
pyrazine and thus a vm blanc and we did

981
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:29,309
phenolic analysis on the Pinot to help

982
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:31,799
see if this chemistry is being affected

983
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:34,349
by these this is the most magic machine

984
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,810
that I grew to use a lot in New

985
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:38,969
Zealand's called the wine scan basically

986
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:41,039
it will do all those hard work of

987
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:42,599
measuring those bricks ta pH all those

988
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,759
red roads you put a little cup sample

989
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:46,889
this big in it press button she said all

990
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,030
the data it is a chordal of measure so

991
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,589
what you do is you have to calibrate it

992
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:52,110
and calibrating is a big thing with

993
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:53,970
these guys Foss makes them they aren't

994
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:57,440
cheap pieces of equipment a new one that

995
00:34:53,969 --> 00:35:01,109
will also do sulfur's runs 200 plus

996
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,670
thousand dollars that is but if for

997
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,320
large-scale production wineries and for

998
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,659
research purposes I cannot stress how

999
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,460
awesome they were plant food has one and

1000
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:10,579
a lot of them and some of the bigger

1001
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,659
wineries in New Zealand have them

1002
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:14,190
they're amazing for being able to

1003
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:16,019
process that much data and be able to

1004
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,000
look at it in real time and that was a

1005
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:19,500
really awesome experience you can see

1006
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,719
there that's a little that's a sight

1007
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,039
from the Pinot research site down there

1008
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,629
the Pinot's being naturally less

1009
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,670
vigorous the Saudi amok there are some

1010
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,200
fun comparisons there a lot of that data

1011
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,490
is well as probably the process now but

1012
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:31,019
I haven't looked at and gotten up to

1013
00:35:29,489 --> 00:35:33,419
date on all of it but it's been

1014
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:35,519
interesting I was on the what was it the

1015
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,440
second year of the trial it's going on

1016
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,969
for a third and there's a lot of

1017
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,200
interesting data it's sort of similar to

1018
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:42,509
mine and it's looking at there might be

1019
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:44,029
some nutrient effects you're looking at

1020
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,990
lower nitrogen levels when you have

1021
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,280
stuff growing underneath the vine

1022
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:49,349
compared to when you don't have stuff

1023
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,960
growing beneath divine and maybe some

1024
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:53,819
deviation that's coming from that it'll

1025
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,679
be interesting to see the conclusions of

1026
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,480
the use of this site after three years

1027
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,399
so she's given the parallels to my own

1028
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,719
work so it's kind of fun to go see a

1029
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,950
different way of doing kind of the same

1030
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,480
idea and get some new ideas and

1031
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:08,129
perspective on the research that's been

1032
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:11,240
near and dear to me here at Cornell we

1033
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,240
are very concerned about

1034
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:17,949
yeah the D bigger problem wasn't even so

1035
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:19,929
much what they're looking at it's more

1036
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:22,028
the sustainable slant they're more

1037
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:23,679
worried about they don't want to really

1038
00:36:22,028 --> 00:36:25,750
be bigger the growers are very very

1039
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:26,618
nervous about that idea but the idea of

1040
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,268
being able to say you don't use

1041
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:30,730
herbicide or don't have to cultivate is

1042
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:32,858
really desirable there because of this

1043
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,659
there that sustainable kind of focused

1044
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,768
at sustainable wine growing focus so

1045
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,808
that's more where the drive of this

1046
00:36:35,768 --> 00:36:39,818
project comes from for Pinot that might

1047
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:41,500
be a different story and also I happen

1048
00:36:39,818 --> 00:36:45,130
to be there during a year of record

1049
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:47,409
yields like a dr. mark trot has a model

1050
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,240
that predicts yields around me some alaz

1051
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:50,768
work and his model predicted something

1052
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:52,118
like eighty percent above normal and

1053
00:36:50,768 --> 00:36:54,788
everyone's like that can't be right but

1054
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:57,640
it was so given the incredible high

1055
00:36:54,789 --> 00:37:00,250
yield of this year it wasn't such a big

1056
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:01,538
deal but yeah in future years that would

1057
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,099
be a problem most of these growers are

1058
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:04,510
not looking to reduce you of whatsoever

1059
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:06,250
but they really do want to eliminate

1060
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:07,778
herbicide or cultivation for one those

1061
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:10,449
are caught like mowing is easy mowings

1062
00:37:07,778 --> 00:37:11,798
cheap and easy and for them that would

1063
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:13,509
be a huge advantage compared of having

1064
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:16,509
to hire a contractor to come out and

1065
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:17,950
cultivate or apply herbicide so that's

1066
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:19,119
more this plant that they're going for

1067
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:20,469
and they're wondering can they get away

1068
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,420
with it without seeing huge

1069
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:29,139
depreciations to yields or affecting

1070
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:31,240
line chemistry I have never heard anyone

1071
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:33,489
express it in that description I don't

1072
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:35,739
actually think they're necessarily

1073
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:37,629
talking about it in those terms is the

1074
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:39,278
best way I can say it if anything it's

1075
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,900
more they don't like percent gaps in the

1076
00:37:39,278 --> 00:37:43,389
canopy because that's considered wasted

1077
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,740
space that could have been fruit so most

1078
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:46,420
of the savvy on Blanc is being grown

1079
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:48,909
like three canes in a two-tiered system

1080
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,440
so most of its already plenty shaded

1081
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:51,969
it's more that they don't want that

1082
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,500
reduction in yield if that's a gap in

1083
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,548
the canopy them that that could have

1084
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,659
been a shoot that could have been a

1085
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:57,759
cluster that could have been fruit that

1086
00:37:55,659 --> 00:38:00,308
was sold and I think especially when you

1087
00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:01,269
have a grower contract based industry

1088
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:02,950
you saw the number of growers to

1089
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:04,508
wineries like these growers are making

1090
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:06,879
their money by having some decent yields

1091
00:38:04,509 --> 00:38:08,559
so there's that kind of counterpoint to

1092
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,150
so sort of different very different

1093
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:11,349
perspective than my research or it's

1094
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,000
like please can we do anything to slow

1095
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:15,579
these lines down that being said for

1096
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,869
them to you know it does have seasonal

1097
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:18,579
rainfall but nothing like where we are

1098
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:20,318
so they're able to irrigate to control

1099
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:22,839
and they will up the irrigation as they

1100
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:23,139
feel nervous to get more growth and get

1101
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:26,049
plenty

1102
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:27,879
methoxy pyrogens and shading so at least

1103
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:30,519
from what I can see the the Marlborough

1104
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,780
style is terroir but also terroir the

1105
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:33,909
sense of that water is included in your

1106
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,220
taxes and you can irrigate so I think

1107
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:38,799
that's not necessarily their huge

1108
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:42,429
concern I at least that's what I gleamed

1109
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,510
from my perspective of it so it's

1110
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:45,369
definitely more of a yield loss

1111
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,170
potential income concern that they have

1112
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:48,369
been maintaining a wine style I think

1113
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,550
the wine style is going to be there even

1114
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:53,289
if you did have some reduction in yields

1115
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:55,510
so the research side I was just

1116
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:57,279
describing was in fact owned by so

1117
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,780
Pernod Ricard I'll probably use these

1118
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,269
interchangeably Pernod Ricard is the

1119
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,550
giant corporation that owns this label

1120
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:07,690
called brancott estate so it was a

1121
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:09,190
winery in Marlborough called Montana for

1122
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,300
a really long time but when / no bought

1123
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,679
them and they wanted to start exporting

1124
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,320
their wine you can't export a wine

1125
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,149
called Montana from New Zealand it was

1126
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,530
just a family name so they really abled

1127
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,059
it as brancott so when you're there

1128
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,310
you'll still have people call it Montana

1129
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:24,460
if people call brancott people call it /

1130
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:26,469
no so because Pernod as a whole the

1131
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:29,440
winery / no wine makers of in marlboro

1132
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:31,149
make about 16 labels but so this

1133
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,070
research side i saw was at the renwick

1134
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,869
estate for brink or you know under this

1135
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,870
brancott label and they have a gorgeous

1136
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:40,029
tasting room that I enjoy frequenting

1137
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:41,049
and enjoying some sauce blanc and also

1138
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:45,790
just sort of a sign of the

1139
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:48,310
sustainability and they have this I rat

1140
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:50,380
reintroducing the native Raptor bird of

1141
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:52,210
New Zealand into the vineyard sites to

1142
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,710
help control with bird damage because

1143
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,480
like I said birds are huge pests these

1144
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:58,119
guys hunt and eat them so brancott

1145
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,530
estate is the winery and vineyards that

1146
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:00,309
were helping to promote this so every

1147
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,350
now and then you see these little

1148
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:03,309
adorable hawk started out or falcons i

1149
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:05,650
should say it's a new zealand falcon

1150
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:07,929
tried it out and they explain what

1151
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:10,030
they're doing to promote a natural bird

1152
00:40:07,929 --> 00:40:12,579
control and also help to reintroduce a

1153
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:18,040
native species and get there get their

1154
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:19,119
numbers back up so brancott estate some

1155
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,500
people might call this factory

1156
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:26,170
winemaking I just call it large-scale

1157
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:27,820
winemaking we it's about more icon else

1158
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:30,250
solid said's more than four million

1159
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:34,180
cases of wine are produced every year at

1160
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:36,068
this facility the pronoun Ricard wine

1161
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:37,899
winery in Blenheim

1162
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:39,219
otherwise known as brain cloud estate so

1163
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,199
for 500 tanks i think when i was there

1164
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:43,900
was well over six hundred tanks active

1165
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:45,579
we used for fermentation this is under

1166
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,719
16 different brands the one in the back

1167
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:48,190
of the room that I please encourage

1168
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,108
everyone to help yourself to a splash of

1169
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,400
this brand caught a state that's kind of

1170
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:53,018
the number one label tier that you're

1171
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,579
going to see around other labels that

1172
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:56,078
make include stoneleigh and that's

1173
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:57,339
actually exported a lot to Canada so

1174
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,690
I've actually seen it more around here

1175
00:40:57,338 --> 00:41:00,578
in New York and I've seen it like in

1176
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,019
California other places but those are

1177
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:03,309
there two big brands that they're quite

1178
00:41:02,018 --> 00:41:05,139
famous for but they do make several

1179
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:08,199
others and we did take on some contract

1180
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:12,038
by making as well so big mix of labels

1181
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:14,699
varieties kind of fun way to get my

1182
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:18,249
hands dirty and New Zealand wine making

1183
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:20,559
so I after kind of helping up and

1184
00:41:18,248 --> 00:41:21,818
finishing a lot of the de cultural data

1185
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:27,969
that needed to be collected in the field

1186
00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:30,068
for the research I kind of I took on a

1187
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:32,108
position as a harvest lab tech at pernod

1188
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:34,358
ricard refresh my wine making skills a

1189
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:36,038
little bit so day my normal life as you

1190
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,478
wake up at the crack of dawn beautiful

1191
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:39,999
views you wake up at the crack of dawn

1192
00:41:37,478 --> 00:41:41,498
to collect permanent samples all the

1193
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,968
winemakers met I worked on the white

1194
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:45,879
wine shift the morning shift all the

1195
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:47,588
winemakers wanted their wines by eight

1196
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,059
o'clock sub that's we were out there

1197
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,440
nice and bright and early all the

1198
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:53,109
different colors and tape for different

1199
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,630
varieties green is sev a blue is Pinot

1200
00:41:53,108 --> 00:41:57,429
Gris you know Chardonnay see there and

1201
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,259
this is for the winemakers to taste and

1202
00:41:57,429 --> 00:42:00,879
we monitor the fermentation to see as

1203
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:02,199
sugars converted to alcohol where it is

1204
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,019
in that process make sure that the

1205
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:06,759
temperature is okay for that level for

1206
00:42:05,018 --> 00:42:08,798
incoming juice samples say something

1207
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:10,539
just got trucked into a tank will run

1208
00:42:08,798 --> 00:42:12,579
the juice on that wine scan that I told

1209
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:14,049
you that's so wonderful and will also

1210
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:15,729
run finished wines on that wine scan

1211
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:17,108
that was at the end of season we're also

1212
00:42:15,728 --> 00:42:19,298
running a lot of analysis on juice like

1213
00:42:17,108 --> 00:42:20,798
for pectin and for clarity see there's

1214
00:42:19,298 --> 00:42:22,088
any additional processing that needed to

1215
00:42:20,798 --> 00:42:25,119
happen to this juice before it could be

1216
00:42:22,088 --> 00:42:27,818
made into the Furman sent along its way

1217
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,949
into fermentation all of our numbers on

1218
00:42:27,818 --> 00:42:31,058
the juice and potential grape samples

1219
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:32,769
that came in every day that we're

1220
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:34,839
running on that wine scan were helped

1221
00:42:32,768 --> 00:42:35,889
use to make this incredibly complicated

1222
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:36,969
planning board imagine a whole

1223
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:38,828
conference room like this with white

1224
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:40,028
boards on every side every white board

1225
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:42,459
looks something like this in the thick

1226
00:42:40,028 --> 00:42:44,349
of harvest so every individual tag there

1227
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:46,149
represents a block of grapes what's

1228
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:47,680
really cool on the senior lab technician

1229
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,599
i worked with Arvid actually came up

1230
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,839
with this originally every day in the

1231
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,220
lab

1232
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,269
you get your grape sample updates or

1233
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:53,709
your juice updates and you'd have to

1234
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,909
write it a hand on a tag and these

1235
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:57,579
little magnets were used around a

1236
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:59,379
schedule harvesting there's those tags

1237
00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:00,849
though that in supermarkets that can put

1238
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,190
that our electronic that allow them to

1239
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:04,929
update prices whenever they want he

1240
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:07,630
created a computer system and use these

1241
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:10,690
tags to basically update the bricks ta

1242
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:12,309
ph values in addition to knowing how the

1243
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,470
cluster weights they could estimate the

1244
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:16,719
tonnage and thereby estimate tractor

1245
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:17,889
time down a row and how much time it

1246
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,809
would take for an individual tractor to

1247
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:21,279
harvest the block then the winemakers

1248
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:23,019
can go into those big planning room and

1249
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,970
figure out what they're bringing in each

1250
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:27,610
day and the timing of it so it's this

1251
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:28,929
very big complicated organization system

1252
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:31,329
but it was really kind of awesome to see

1253
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:32,739
and be a part of on how do you make more

1254
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:35,380
than 4 million cases of wine and a

1255
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:36,609
harvest a lot of planning and you hope

1256
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,280
things don't go wrong and you hope the

1257
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:41,019
weather stays nice one of my other jobs

1258
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,030
was good thing I'm not scared of heights

1259
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:46,389
I you would clamor to the top of perhaps

1260
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:48,190
me for 25 story called tanks some of our

1261
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:51,309
larger tanks held over five hundred

1262
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:52,809
thousand litres and I would take top of

1263
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:55,179
tank temperatures while we had a system

1264
00:43:52,809 --> 00:43:56,320
that would regulate the temperature you

1265
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:58,269
had a double check because we have such

1266
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,950
tall tanks you can get stratification so

1267
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:01,869
this was double checking that this lot

1268
00:43:59,949 --> 00:44:03,009
of ferment was uniform so I'd scamp

1269
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:05,469
around to the top of all the little cat

1270
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:08,020
box papam lids drop in temperature probe

1271
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:09,579
that was one of my big jobs also being

1272
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:11,230
the lonely minion on the level when we

1273
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:13,719
got a rainstorm where it was raining

1274
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:15,820
inches an hour with probably a 50 mile

1275
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:18,039
an hour plus wins I was the one you got

1276
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,510
to go to the top of Tanks also senior

1277
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:20,440
check did come with me on that one

1278
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,940
because I think they're afraid of the

1279
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,730
liability of me being blown over the

1280
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,260
catwalk railings but I got to go get

1281
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,869
completely drenched taking top of tank

1282
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:31,210
temperatures for wine makers so it's it

1283
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:32,739
was you know poor lowly lab tech but I

1284
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,880
had a lot of fun doing this I got to be

1285
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:36,309
active every day walking around the

1286
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,809
winery and I you know I dividual II

1287
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:38,949
touched and handle every single permit

1288
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:40,269
that was going on you kind of develop

1289
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:42,250
your favorite lots and you know your

1290
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:45,159
problem lots it's a really fun thing to

1291
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:46,960
do this is a rough view of the lab see

1292
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:48,759
our vision that or hive is the big thing

1293
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,260
by the way in New Zealand's you always

1294
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,310
wear high vis whenever in a winery or a

1295
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:55,810
vineyard very sexy and neon so you can

1296
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:57,219
see arvid's on the left there and my

1297
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:58,929
coworker Lydia was on the right on that

1298
00:44:57,219 --> 00:45:00,759
upper picture that's the lab where Lydia

1299
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:02,349
is we entered in all the data we would

1300
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,079
receive off of the wine scanner all that

1301
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:05,088
analysis we did

1302
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:06,859
into this giant kind of electronic lab

1303
00:45:05,088 --> 00:45:08,630
notebook that the wine makers could then

1304
00:45:06,858 --> 00:45:10,248
access and automatically right up work

1305
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:11,749
orders from it's actually one of a

1306
00:45:10,248 --> 00:45:13,998
really cool integrated computer systems

1307
00:45:11,748 --> 00:45:15,618
I've seen and then the bottom picture

1308
00:45:13,998 --> 00:45:17,238
that's Joe she's monitoring ferments

1309
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:19,219
that would have come in later that day

1310
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:20,778
it's a nice big lab space but you need

1311
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:22,219
it for and every inch of that lab was

1312
00:45:20,778 --> 00:45:25,190
used but you need it for that big of

1313
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:27,019
production one of my special projects I

1314
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,670
got to be a part of was we bought a new

1315
00:45:27,018 --> 00:45:30,439
line scan and this wine scandal is extra

1316
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,599
special because it would also do sulfur

1317
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,249
analysis for us sulfur is really

1318
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:36,739
important in winemaking it guarantees

1319
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:39,679
microbial stability and keeping wines

1320
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:41,358
from oxidizing so when otherwise your

1321
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,190
methods include either manual sulfur's a

1322
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,498
picture of that large chemical looking

1323
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:47,659
contraption at the top via aeration

1324
00:45:45,498 --> 00:45:49,518
oxidation or we actually had a machine

1325
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:52,098
at the lab called a fee estar which is

1326
00:45:49,518 --> 00:45:53,419
very temperamental at best so being able

1327
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:55,338
to eliminate the fetus star was a big

1328
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,019
goal so the promise as I said all the

1329
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:58,699
wineskins stuff is calibration based you

1330
00:45:57,018 --> 00:46:01,518
run manual numbers and program it and it

1331
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:03,259
creates a calibration curve so as you

1332
00:46:01,518 --> 00:46:05,208
need very precise calibration to get

1333
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:07,849
good numbers that you trust so me being

1334
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:10,518
the intern who had extra time ran

1335
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:12,559
hundreds maybe a thousand vandal

1336
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:14,268
sulfur's on different juices and wine

1337
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:15,469
testing different levels to create the

1338
00:46:14,268 --> 00:46:17,179
calibration curves that was sort of my

1339
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:18,499
little extra contribution by the end of

1340
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:19,940
season it was calibrated we were using

1341
00:46:18,498 --> 00:46:22,788
it for sulfur's so that was a really

1342
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:24,559
nice moment also me being not there so

1343
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:26,359
the normal temporary harvest lab tech

1344
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,160
that they were used to have pestered the

1345
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:30,228
lab manager and senior lab tech to teach

1346
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:32,298
me capillary electrophoresis that's on

1347
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:34,429
the left we use that for measuring malic

1348
00:46:32,298 --> 00:46:37,009
acid for standardizing that new mine

1349
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:39,139
scan and I also was got to play around

1350
00:46:37,009 --> 00:46:41,449
with the GCMs a little bit which we use

1351
00:46:39,139 --> 00:46:43,248
for detecting off a room is caused by

1352
00:46:41,449 --> 00:46:45,139
Brittana my sees a spoiler organism and

1353
00:46:43,248 --> 00:46:46,429
wine so they have a bit of a program to

1354
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:48,920
test through to make sure no the lots

1355
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:51,108
come in too high for the Brett spoilage

1356
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,059
and then what do you do at the end of

1357
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:56,478
day of lab tech you have beer with your

1358
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:57,949
friends watching rugby at a bar called

1359
00:46:56,478 --> 00:46:59,239
Fairweather's that was awesome that's

1360
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:02,180
Chris kind of heard the left there

1361
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:03,858
awesome wonderful guy his family totally

1362
00:47:02,179 --> 00:47:05,690
adopted me and I had Kiwi dinners on

1363
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:07,788
Sunday so all I can say is a great

1364
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,559
thanks to Chris and for his help in both

1365
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:11,989
the research but also was becoming a

1366
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:13,699
really good friend of mine so upon

1367
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:15,679
reflection if I had to pick one thing

1368
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:16,820
I've now learned from working in living

1369
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:18,469
and to cool climate

1370
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,289
cultural regions how would I define a

1371
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:24,019
cool climate it's sugar try to pick one

1372
00:47:21,289 --> 00:47:26,329
thing it's the necessary need to add

1373
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:29,300
sugar at any point in your fermentation

1374
00:47:26,329 --> 00:47:31,190
in a warm climate sugars kind of the

1375
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:33,380
enemy you're you're waiting to keep

1376
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:35,599
things on the vine to accumulate other

1377
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:37,940
flavor in a room of compounds but sugar

1378
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,429
just keeps rising you're battling the

1379
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:43,220
sugar and a cool climate you often can

1380
00:47:40,429 --> 00:47:44,779
achieve the aromatics you want or for

1381
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:46,189
other reasons or having to harvest but

1382
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,870
you don't have the sugar you want like I

1383
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:49,519
said I brought apparently the cool

1384
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:51,980
coolest wettest fall they've had in a

1385
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,809
very long time with me so I got to see

1386
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,860
I'm sure they're embarrassed Pernod

1387
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:57,679
would not be too happy for me showing

1388
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,120
these photos but a tons literal tons and

1389
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:00,409
tons and tons of sugar had to be added

1390
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,730
especially for the later lot that were

1391
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:04,489
coming in when the weather kept getting

1392
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:06,530
increasingly bad so that was sort of my

1393
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:07,909
mental reflection of the difference of

1394
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:09,740
anyone asked me between cool climate

1395
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:12,649
more climate if you ever added add sugar

1396
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:15,319
your cool climate so a little bit of

1397
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:17,840
moment the winemaker Greg actually led

1398
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,700
us me and a couple other seasonal

1399
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,380
workers and other employees through a

1400
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:22,909
big tasting of all the different labels

1401
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,559
and wines and compared this year's wines

1402
00:48:22,909 --> 00:48:26,149
to last year you know to pre bottled

1403
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,039
wines it's a really fun tasting

1404
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:29,930
experience to kind of get my head around

1405
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:31,550
the giant portfolio of wines that I just

1406
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:33,649
helped make and the line that you see

1407
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:35,720
here in the screw cap bottler it's a

1408
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:37,670
little special my very first week of

1409
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:40,099
work I was monitoring the fermentation

1410
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:42,289
of this is our low alcohol label called

1411
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:44,360
her flight series line called lunch

1412
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:46,219
wines that's their low alcohol Pinot

1413
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,170
Gris in my very last week of work i

1414
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:49,730
bottled out the samples to be sent to

1415
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,829
Auckland so they could prep to bottle it

1416
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:53,809
was going to be shipped out that week so

1417
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:56,569
I saw whole wines from start to finish

1418
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:59,719
in my little duration in New Zealand so

1419
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:01,930
that was kind of a fun thing so wrapped

1420
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:03,709
up harvest there had a great time and

1421
00:49:01,929 --> 00:49:05,989
traveled a bit my wonderful boyfriend

1422
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:07,730
Dan joined me for the last part of New

1423
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:10,219
Zealand and I'll show you the kind of

1424
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:12,679
last bits of my travels I actually did

1425
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:14,599
give this seminar I gave a seminar plant

1426
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:16,909
food and I gave us an art Lincoln I'm

1427
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:18,559
earlier before harvest it started but i

1428
00:49:16,909 --> 00:49:21,889
also got to visit christchurch again

1429
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:23,779
later so blend creasy of you know dr.

1430
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:26,299
creasy son who had been part of this

1431
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:27,769
department is a viticulture professor at

1432
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,880
lincoln and he and his family

1433
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:30,318
wonderfully welcomed me into his home

1434
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,759
and hosted me

1435
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:32,989
and encouraged me to get a seminar there

1436
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:34,039
on my work that I've done here at

1437
00:49:32,989 --> 00:49:36,139
Cornell that was a really wonderful

1438
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:38,890
opportunity to visit the campus see

1439
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:42,048
their viticulture department and their

1440
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:44,598
school vineyards there and meet Glen and

1441
00:49:42,048 --> 00:49:46,880
kind of see the new zealand academic

1442
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:48,199
side of things and like i said i would

1443
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,119
felt very thankful to be asked to give a

1444
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:51,229
seminar while i was there and like i

1445
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:52,930
said i got to do a fun little visit

1446
00:49:51,228 --> 00:49:55,429
through Christ Church on my way I

1447
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:57,858
finally got to take a little blue

1448
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:59,629
penguin selfie my five-year-old self

1449
00:49:57,858 --> 00:50:02,150
could not have been happier though this

1450
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:03,680
moment there's an Antarctic center in

1451
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,940
christchurch where i got to go see

1452
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:06,588
little blue penguins that have otherwise

1453
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,568
been injured or incapable of being

1454
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:12,170
rereleased so i was a fun way of seeing

1455
00:50:08,568 --> 00:50:14,268
them up close but penguins as i said are

1456
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:17,059
a strong holding theme of this trip so

1457
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:19,608
going down south this is big penguin

1458
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:21,140
country so i stopped at 0 murru where

1459
00:50:19,608 --> 00:50:22,400
there's a little blue penguin colony and

1460
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:23,900
you can see them at the right times of

1461
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,028
year and i got to see them twice come up

1462
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,769
short Colonel and they come in from the

1463
00:50:26,028 --> 00:50:29,088
ocean at night and you can see they have

1464
00:50:27,768 --> 00:50:31,159
their own little Hobbit holes that they

1465
00:50:29,088 --> 00:50:32,719
live in during the day and neston and

1466
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:34,670
you get to see this whole little no

1467
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:37,219
higher than one foot herd of penguins

1468
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:39,440
ascend and it's the cutest thing I have

1469
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:40,729
ever seen in my life and I don't know if

1470
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,849
I couldn't will ever have a happier

1471
00:50:40,728 --> 00:50:45,798
moment in my life I also was fortunate

1472
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:48,140
enough to go to I'm a penguin reserve

1473
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:50,509
and Dunedin where the rare the most

1474
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:52,338
endangered penguin in the world so there

1475
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:55,099
by the rarest as well is the yellow-eyed

1476
00:50:52,338 --> 00:50:57,018
penguin in native to New Zealand they're

1477
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:58,818
solitary unlike every other penguin they

1478
00:50:57,018 --> 00:51:00,618
don't like other penguins they only hang

1479
00:50:58,818 --> 00:51:02,239
about themselves and they're really in

1480
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:03,559
danger mostly due to habitat distraction

1481
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:05,150
so it's not a few place in the world you

1482
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:06,769
can see them and this is a cool little

1483
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,209
site that has little look boxes that you

1484
00:51:06,768 --> 00:51:10,278
can hide in and then they just come up

1485
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:12,348
close and waddle by you so you can see

1486
00:51:10,278 --> 00:51:15,018
this guy's like chillin out there after

1487
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:16,759
a day in the ocean there's also a site

1488
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:18,468
for their self that we travel to call

1489
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:20,088
curio bay where this is a beach which is

1490
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:23,329
also awesome because of the Petrified

1491
00:51:20,088 --> 00:51:24,828
Forest fossil site on the beach but if

1492
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:26,390
you wait to the right time of day the

1493
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:28,548
Penguins come in on shore and I'm just

1494
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:30,889
sitting there on the beach penguins come

1495
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:32,929
no further for me than anyone in the

1496
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:34,368
back row and they just hop up you see

1497
00:51:32,929 --> 00:51:35,808
them swimming hop up and you watch them

1498
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:37,849
go back into the forest to their nesting

1499
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:39,229
sites so that's also one of those things

1500
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:41,239
that all i can say was completely

1501
00:51:39,228 --> 00:51:42,649
magical to see some of my favorite

1502
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:44,059
creatures in the wild that close to me

1503
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,798
and only in New Zealand

1504
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:47,479
you just walk onto a beach they don't

1505
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:49,818
even have Park Rangers there during the

1506
00:51:47,478 --> 00:51:52,038
not nesting parts of year there's just

1507
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:53,478
not enough people new zealand's between

1508
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:54,829
remote areas like this the nearest town

1509
00:51:53,478 --> 00:51:57,858
yours grocery stores probably two hours

1510
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:59,689
away so it's just remote enough that you

1511
00:51:57,858 --> 00:52:03,380
can still get very very close to nature

1512
00:51:59,688 --> 00:52:05,989
in some very special ways then we sort

1513
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:08,469
of did a meandering trip through the

1514
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:11,719
mountains and lakes of New Zealand

1515
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:13,458
Queenstown was an awesome place I did in

1516
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:14,599
fact your bungee jumping I don't have a

1517
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:16,788
better picture unfortunately right now

1518
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:18,289
but that ledge right there you jump over

1519
00:52:16,789 --> 00:52:20,059
the view of queenstown couldn't go to

1520
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:22,130
the home of extreme sports and not

1521
00:52:20,059 --> 00:52:24,289
partake in one so that was me up there

1522
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:25,818
looking very accomplished and then they

1523
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:27,469
also have quite a few ice bars in

1524
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:28,548
Queenstown which are fun to visit

1525
00:52:27,469 --> 00:52:30,938
although I could have just gone outside

1526
00:52:28,548 --> 00:52:33,409
here and experienced the same thing

1527
00:52:30,938 --> 00:52:35,420
milford sound one of the most

1528
00:52:33,409 --> 00:52:38,179
spectacular nature preserves i think on

1529
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:42,048
this planet we were there on a day that

1530
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:43,429
was pouring rain pouring rain but we did

1531
00:52:42,048 --> 00:52:45,288
get to see thousands and thousands of

1532
00:52:43,429 --> 00:52:46,909
waterfalls that was sort of amazing and

1533
00:52:45,289 --> 00:52:48,528
then there were a few beautiful sights

1534
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:50,028
as you drive into the reserve this is

1535
00:52:48,528 --> 00:52:53,268
called mirror lake for its very

1536
00:52:50,028 --> 00:52:55,458
mirror-like attributes i hope to return

1537
00:52:53,268 --> 00:52:58,308
one day when it's not so pouring rains i

1538
00:52:55,458 --> 00:53:00,798
can actually see some more but it was

1539
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:03,798
very fun she go see such you know you

1540
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:05,958
have huge huge crevasses because it's a

1541
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:07,278
few or carved by glaciers and you sail

1542
00:53:05,958 --> 00:53:09,919
your boat down the middle and you get to

1543
00:53:07,278 --> 00:53:12,318
see huge kind of mountainous like stone

1544
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,838
and like sons of waterfalls gushing down

1545
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,248
below we then made our way through lake

1546
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:17,509
country kind of detoured from our

1547
00:53:16,248 --> 00:53:19,698
original plan do the weather concerns

1548
00:53:17,509 --> 00:53:21,380
because this is now early winter in New

1549
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:23,150
Zealand where I saw probably when I

1550
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,099
think is the most stunning view this is

1551
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:27,108
like to capo you can see what's called

1552
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:28,640
the Southern Alps that mountain range

1553
00:53:27,108 --> 00:53:30,288
throughout the south of New Zealand and

1554
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,420
it's a glacier fed lake so it has an

1555
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:33,499
awesome blue color and all I can say is

1556
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,019
once again it's on the most stunning

1557
00:53:33,498 --> 00:53:37,639
views I've ever seen in my life so

1558
00:53:36,018 --> 00:53:39,678
having worked out with Lord of the Rings

1559
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:41,239
I've bypassed most of the nerdiest stuff

1560
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:42,679
for you guys but I can't ignore that I

1561
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:44,659
climbed another mountain in the name of

1562
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:46,900
Lord of the Rings the second movie two

1563
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:50,958
towers people of Rohan live in ed Roth

1564
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:52,910
that right there is Eddie Ross they

1565
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:54,768
because this is a nature preserve they

1566
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:56,509
had to tear down the set completely but

1567
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:57,929
the whole mountain set and the little

1568
00:53:56,509 --> 00:53:59,818
trails they used are still

1569
00:53:57,929 --> 00:54:02,159
there and you can hike up to it you kind

1570
00:53:59,818 --> 00:54:05,969
of drive off very very beaten path down

1571
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:07,679
dirt gravel roads and went up there but

1572
00:54:05,969 --> 00:54:09,629
it was an also kind of a rainy day but

1573
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:11,429
it was awesome to say we climbed at a

1574
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:13,200
rough and I got to be right there and

1575
00:54:11,429 --> 00:54:15,808
what's amazing about this view is this

1576
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:17,399
was like not at all CG I'd edited the

1577
00:54:15,809 --> 00:54:18,960
views from that scene or that movie like

1578
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,550
this is the view you get when you're up

1579
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,429
there you can just see all these mess no

1580
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:25,950
cap mountains and beautiful planes so it

1581
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:27,509
was absolutely stunning so then I

1582
00:54:25,949 --> 00:54:29,338
basically ended up reach we ended up

1583
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:31,920
retracing the steps I had formerly taken

1584
00:54:29,338 --> 00:54:33,808
so I'll be brief about them but sort of

1585
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,250
made our way all the way reluctantly

1586
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:37,619
back up to Auckland or are you flying

1587
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:39,719
out how to stop at hobbiton again told

1588
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:41,700
you the lower ranks thing is not minor

1589
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:43,199
with me similarly in Wellington when we

1590
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:44,969
stopped off there's the wet a workshop

1591
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,759
the wet a cave so that's the special

1592
00:54:44,969 --> 00:54:50,279
effects kind of agency and props group

1593
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,359
that Peter Jackson had founded at the

1594
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,250
time of lord the rings they've since

1595
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,328
done a lot of other movies but it's

1596
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:56,969
really awesome they have these full

1597
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:58,859
scale models and trolls and the actual

1598
00:54:56,969 --> 00:55:01,049
weapons used in or the Rings dutiful to

1599
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:02,308
ER they're stopped off in Rotorua where

1600
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:04,260
my father had been all those years ago

1601
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:06,420
they're famous for their geothermal hot

1602
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,950
springs have an amazing museum that Ian

1603
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,970
ruined had recommended to me that I hit

1604
00:55:07,949 --> 00:55:11,098
so I was very thankful for that

1605
00:55:08,969 --> 00:55:13,108
recommendation and then we actually did

1606
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:14,548
hit Blenheim before going back to the

1607
00:55:13,108 --> 00:55:16,048
North Island and it was cut outs

1608
00:55:14,548 --> 00:55:17,818
brancott estate that tasting room

1609
00:55:16,048 --> 00:55:19,559
vineyard and you could see there mostly

1610
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:20,818
at leaf drop stage some few straggling

1611
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:21,900
yellow leaves so I got to kind of see

1612
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:24,048
the vineyard through the peak and

1613
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:26,700
through the end of the season again I

1614
00:55:24,048 --> 00:55:29,068
was reluctant but actually did go to the

1615
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:31,019
HMO glowworm caves it's like probably

1616
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:33,298
the number one Google tourist site thing

1617
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:35,280
to see in New Zealand all I can say is

1618
00:55:33,298 --> 00:55:37,980
do it I was blown away I couldn't

1619
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,900
believe I was hesitant to not go yeah

1620
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:43,469
these little glow worms he basically

1621
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:44,880
fast for us and they lined the roof or

1622
00:55:43,469 --> 00:55:46,818
ceiling of these naturally formed

1623
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,500
limestone caves it's simply breathtaking

1624
00:55:46,818 --> 00:55:50,608
so we made our way back to Auckland you

1625
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,010
can see the beautiful little Sky Tower

1626
00:55:50,608 --> 00:55:54,869
there which we then took an elevator up

1627
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:57,510
to and there's a beautiful panoramic

1628
00:55:54,869 --> 00:55:58,890
view around the top and SAT there

1629
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:00,569
relaxing before we were catching a

1630
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:02,368
flight much later that evening but I

1631
00:56:00,568 --> 00:56:03,808
thought it was of note on my last day i

1632
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:05,640
was looking at on that bridge right

1633
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:07,260
there was the very first bridge i took

1634
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:08,969
out and drove off on to go to the

1635
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,540
Northland right after picking up my car

1636
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:12,939
in New Zealand and heading off

1637
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:16,269
adventure so a nice big full circle of

1638
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:18,130
closure so that's sort of a brief I

1639
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:20,880
could have talked for six weeks about my

1640
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:22,840
six-month trip try to keep it reasonable

1641
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,980
but I really can't think that your

1642
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,760
committee enough for this life changing

1643
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:29,349
opportunity not only did I get to

1644
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,330
fulfill a dream I've had since I can't

1645
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:33,489
even remember and see some of the most

1646
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:36,730
beautiful spectacular images in nature i

1647
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:38,379
can imagine exist but the career

1648
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,670
opportunities i was afforded by being

1649
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:41,170
going there and connecting with

1650
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:43,300
researchers and getting an international

1651
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:44,559
perspective i have been told directly by

1652
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,360
a few the people who have hired me that

1653
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,099
it was impressive to have such diverse

1654
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,289
experience between California New York

1655
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:52,110
and New Zealand so all I can say is

1656
00:56:50,289 --> 00:56:55,000
thank you so much I don't have the words

1657
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:57,340
so few people have been asking me what

1658
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,780
about doing sense after I finished up my

1659
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:00,309
Master's I went on to work as a

1660
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:02,140
viticultural and lab technician at

1661
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:04,630
quintessa but I'm actually just about to

1662
00:57:02,139 --> 00:57:06,969
start my position as a viticulture form

1663
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:09,400
advisor for UC cooperative extension her

1664
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:10,959
Merced Mariposa in madera counties so as

1665
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,789
I said they've been told like a few

1666
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,679
people in that position that my diverse

1667
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:16,989
have had experienced greatly contributed

1668
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:17,889
to me as a candidate so I'm really

1669
00:57:16,989 --> 00:57:19,299
thankful I got to share those

1670
00:57:17,889 --> 00:57:20,619
experiences with you today thank you all

1671
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,850
for coming out please help yourself with

1672

some wine I'm happy to answer any

1673
00:57:21,849 --> 00:57:35,009
questions push your hand like

1674
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:49,930
wiki when you start at the percent the

1675
00:57:46,659 --> 00:57:51,279
17 so right when I get back to New York

1676
00:57:49,929 --> 00:57:53,529
I've offered a few days so hopefully

1677
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,690
whether it doesn't mess up my plans and

1678
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:57,940
then I start I've already wait a few

1679
00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:00,309
workshops though and sort of meeting

1680
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:04,929
i'll be associated already out there so

1681
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:08,019
i'm really getting it started three gold

1682
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:18,879
face thanks to question so so rumor has

1683
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:21,099
it that bad but Marlboros style hey like

1684
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,440
that hands better believe that because

1685
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:25,269
it's all export market most of New

1686
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,309
Zealand ones the vast majority or export

1687
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:29,108
is it mostly made for it for creation

1688
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:31,179
toulouse by the way is what CEO of

1689
00:58:29,108 --> 00:58:33,460
American close to native Canada I belong

1690
00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:35,949
two types of sweden's because it is sort

1691
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:38,139
of another big buyer but also American

1692
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:40,868
for sure so I don't need to break up ok

1693
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:43,449
lowering occupations the room to have to

1694
00:58:40,869 --> 00:58:45,490
they are yeah the ones that you're

1695
00:58:43,449 --> 00:58:47,289
getting domestically for sure have a bit

1696
00:58:45,489 --> 00:58:48,879
of a different me there's still more bro

1697
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:51,009
soft blanc but i think they tend to be a

1698
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,470
little more balanced in a little less in

1699
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:55,030
your face green but i think that's also

1700
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:58,659
they're a little more delicate I think

1701
00:58:55,030 --> 00:59:00,280
they're a little a little a little more

1702
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:02,559
complex ones in our birth parents and

1703
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,930
especially domestically you get the top

1704
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:08,858
tier labels but they're not exporting so

1705
00:59:04,929 --> 00:59:10,598
like brancott estate makes a chosen what

1706
00:59:08,858 --> 00:59:12,199
you can get google is placed in muldrow

1707
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:14,000
for a white especially

1708
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:17,569
and like that's that's incredibly new

1709
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,460
ones not at all moto style they also are

1710
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:21,019
playing around a lot with oak exposure

1711
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,730
to cell phones actually really fun to

1712
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:23,929
see in taste I love it I love it was

1713
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,190
added a lot of forms I'd love to put out

1714
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:27,319
the Napa that I think these feelings

1715
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:28,849
doing it very delicately as well so

1716
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,859
that's the other flavor profile it was a

1717
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:32,750
lot more there I would say there were

1718
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:34,309
subdued but I certainly could and then I

1719
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:35,780
will say this i just know this from my

1720
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:38,059
end like Frank coffee no that's like the

1721
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:40,790
US for half-life you know Sam to make so

1722
00:59:38,059 --> 00:59:42,019
many cases of it so for sure that being

1723
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:43,190
said it's because that's who's buying

1724
00:59:42,019 --> 00:59:44,719
most of New Zealand's why does the

1725
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:46,700
export market so I easily could believe

1726
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:48,348
it that's probably true that the steps

1727
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:50,838
here I haven't seen numbers to buy

1728
00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:52,430
anything promise that but I would say I

1729
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:54,529
would agree with that well it's

1730
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:56,509
interesting because we just absolutely

1731
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:58,609
fell in love with the soap in your lungs

1732
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:01,490
to be tried while we were in New Zealand

1733
00:59:58,608 --> 01:00:04,639
but we haven't been able to find any in

1734
01:00:01,489 --> 01:00:06,949
the u.s. that have been quite I mean

1735
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:10,429
most of my labels I can't even art

1736
01:00:06,949 --> 01:00:13,639
export it so for me I night I do I was

1737
01:00:10,429 --> 01:00:17,539
out of luck when it came that some of it

1738
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:19,489
like the doctors Riesling is one of my

1739
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:21,230
supply absolute strength increasing at

1740
01:00:19,489 --> 01:00:23,239
my explains a lot of words every year

1741
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:24,829
but they don't export these pretty small

1742
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:26,929
productions so that's an example if

1743
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:28,880
that's just all so if you're tasting at

1744
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:30,500
local prolly cuz I'm trying to keep it

1745
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,430
local mostly export one thinks that they

1746
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,139
don't have a tasting your that I'm

1747
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:35,299
anything there bottled warehouse

1748
01:00:33,139 --> 01:00:37,039
gentleman cargo ship there's no medium

1749
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:38,210
to in which to taste their so what

1750
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:39,829
you're tasting their people who are

1751
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:42,280
looking at cell there so it's a

1752
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:45,300
different market fit a smaller market

1753
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:47,730
let's see how much time is a she goes on

1754
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:50,190
a lot of mechanism we still haven't

1755
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:52,920
there's toughest interview it's sort of

1756
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:56,179
very bad luck most of it that's part of

1757
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:58,800
it specialized in vast majority of it is

1758
01:00:56,179 --> 01:01:00,899
under in you know weekend for spring you

1759
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:04,080
know obviously the spring you do get a

1760
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:06,180
chance leasing um dos see sheep pudding

1761
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,409
which i think is have known it fairly if

1762
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:10,259
you'd love you put in there before the

1763
01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:11,759
very start to turn ever reason they do

1764
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:14,670
better job best jobs that they've ever

1765
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,130
seen doubt of immunity them but it's

1766
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:18,570
still hand pruning good because it's a

1767
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:21,329
lot of campaigns so there's no peace

1768
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:24,420
agreement mechanized back and they've

1769
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:27,269
enough develop flavor to do that I ever

1770
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:29,940
saw is a problem everywhere you go they

1771
01:01:27,269 --> 01:01:31,380
rely heavily on backpackers like

1772
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,750
traveling poker we make some money

1773
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:35,670
there's a big culture of that and there

1774
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:39,000
are some ties that come down and some

1775
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:42,930
other you know Indonesian populations

1776
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,730
but it's and an ultimate like the aisle

1777
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:46,589
like people from Fiji you had a lot to

1778
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:48,809
do and stuff on provide once they also

1779
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:51,240
come from labor but it's it's a problem

1780
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:52,739
that's it authorities is mechanized some

1781
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:54,629
of the smaller regions work with T greed

1782
01:01:52,739 --> 01:01:56,969
is that can afford the hand labor and

1783
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:58,710
can find it because they're also small

1784
01:01:56,969 --> 01:02:00,659
but they don't know you need your to see

1785
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:03,420
these guys and they can cook that like

1786
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:04,589
Waikiki ml comes to mind there so it's

1787
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,450
definitely a lot of meth addition in

1788
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,829
muldrow all that big stuff oh yeah for

1789
01:02:06,449 --> 01:02:09,750
sure there's just the way you harvest it

1790
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:11,460
all that narrow time frame anyway but

1791
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:13,079
you usually do still see some hambrick

1792
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:14,940
especially more of the small at regents

1793
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:16,289
that I showed on that map like some

1794
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,990
kinda Hawke's Bay it was a lot of

1795
01:02:16,289 --> 01:02:21,539
handwork these leaves are these five or

1796
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:22,979
so manicure with a metric laughing at

1797
01:02:21,539 --> 01:02:24,869
meets them like they're making

1798
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:27,449
everything's naked they could sweep it

1799
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:29,699
up to five or six notes and everything's

1800
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:31,710
just and I have one cluster pursued and

1801
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:33,000
be so perfect and manicured there's a

1802
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:35,970
lot of handwork there but obviously

1803
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,579
there's def distal machine pro so but

1804
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:39,869
very little machine can opener yeah that

1805
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:41,730
I saw well I know it's a lot is

1806
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:42,618
backpackers bring I kept having a joke

1807
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:45,170
that I could promise

1808
01:02:42,619 --> 01:02:46,849
sell federer pruning then I could have

1809
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:48,710
been up working in the lab because I

1810
01:02:46,849 --> 01:02:50,028
don't want to came career well I'm sure

1811
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:50,900
being in New York and I could have

1812
01:02:50,028 --> 01:02:52,429
looked through compared to those

1813
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:55,910
backpackers you've never picked a fish

1814
01:02:52,429 --> 01:02:57,348
creatures before so let's yeah we have a

1815
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:59,568
lot of that I think there's open the

1816
01:02:57,349 --> 01:03:12,680
chemical recruiting for sure but a lot

1817
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:15,710
of its still hammered this has been a

1818
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:19,058
production of Cornell University on the

1819
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:19,059
