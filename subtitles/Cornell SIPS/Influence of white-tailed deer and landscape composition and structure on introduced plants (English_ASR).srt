1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,839
University thanks

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,080
[Applause]

4
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:18,839
Tony it's really good to be back at

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,399
Cornell and back in a my home department

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,039
or section now crop soil and crop

7
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:27,278
Sciences so thanks everyone for being

8
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:29,640
here and today like Tony said I'm

9
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,359
sharing results from my dissertation

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,320
which I I completed last summer looking

11
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:40,000
at invasive plants and white tailed deer

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,119
so to begin with I just want to thank my

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,480
committee um Dave Morton and Erica

14
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,479
Smithwick were my co-advisors at Penn

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:51,000
State and I had a lot of help with this

16
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:54,799
project from fi lots of field assistants

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,799
to several contributors of data uh a lot

18
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:00,479
of scientists in the region shared their

19
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:03,079
large Plant Community data sets with me

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,079
so I'm really grateful for those

21
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,519
contributions and also for oh this might

22
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,519
be advancing

23
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,519
automatically

24
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,519
uh and also for the other support I

25
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,200
received at Penn State both funding and

26
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,478
and

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,960
otherwise so invasive plants are

28
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,599
associated with a lot of changes both at

29
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,158
the Eco at the ecosystem level and

30
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:32,239
within the plant Community such as

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,640
altered plant animal and microbial

32
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,519
communities biodiversity is often

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,079
associated with plant invasions and

34
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:46,359
ecosystem processes can can also be

35
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:49,718
influenced oh I'm apologizing for this

36
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:52,239
advancing let me just switch this pres

37
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:52,239
presenter

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,680
view if I can

39
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:10,079
okay let's go back here for a

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,560
second so although all of these changes

41
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,040
are occurring alongside plant invasions

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,719
we don't necessarily know that plants

43
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:21,679
are the drivers and so the question is

44
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,239
whether other processes such as changing

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,280
disturbance regimes or altered Community

46
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,480
assembly factors such as landscape

47
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,680
configuration and deer browsing might

48
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,639
actually be the ultimate drivers causing

49
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,319
ecosystem changes associated with often

50
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:41,238
associated with invasive

51
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:44,079
plants so deer are quite abundant and

52
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,319
for example at Valley Forge the current

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,640
deer density is 84 deer per square

54
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,199
kilometer and this is several orders of

55
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,199
magnitude higher than pre- European

56
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,359
settlement deer densities which were

57
00:02:53,199 --> 00:03:01,199
often less than 10 deer per square

58
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:06,560
kilometer often around five and

59
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:09,199
uh in nearby areas in itha actually the

60
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,920
there are about 100 deer per square mile

61
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:15,079
in certain places so deer populations as

62
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:18,119
many of you know are are quite high and

63
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,719
they can have big effects on Plants

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,280
especially in Forest understories where

65
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:27,719
where deer take shelter and you can see

66
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,039
in this Ohio Forest a very strong uh

67
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:34,598
browse line as a result of heavy deer

68
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,479
pressure so this can reduce the number

69
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:39,399
of shrubs and herbs in Forest

70
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:42,399
understories causing impacts on other

71
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,920
animals that rely on those species for

72
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,280
habitat and also this can create a

73
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,518
window of opportunity for invasive

74
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,840
plants and indeed there are a lot of

75
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,239
examples of plant invasions in forest

76
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,280
underst stories such as this is Japanese

77
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,560
barberry in Connecticut garlic mustard

78
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,000
which many of you are probably familiar

79
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,319
with there are yearly poles of garlic

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,079
mustard in

81
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:09,919
fingerlakes and Japanese stilt grass

82
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:13,799
this is in south southeastern New York

83
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:16,639
and this this grass and the others are

84
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,918
potentially facilitated by selective

85
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,319
deer

86
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,799
browsing so why are there so many deer

87
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,079
across the

88
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,319
landscape and to show this I I just want

89
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,000
to give you an idea of how the landscape

90
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,519
has changed since pre-european

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,680
settlement currently there's a lot of

92
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,918
agricultural cover whereas they're used

93
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,478
to be large contiguous tracks of forest

94
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:46,359
so in the yellow here you see

95
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:48,879
agricultural land the red and the pink

96
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,400
indicate developed land cover whereas

97
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:55,839
the blue and the green are much less

98
00:04:52,399 --> 00:05:00,439
apparent in these in this map yet that

99
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:04,000
used to be the the pre prevailing um

100
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,800
land cover across the landscape so deer

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,079
are responding to this change in

102
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,319
landscape configuration because the

103
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,159
foraging quality is much better along

104
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,159
Forest edges and in open habitats

105
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:20,400
including crop Fields deer can be quite

106
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,400
problematic in both soy and and in corn

107
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:27,318
even and especially in cover crops a

108
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:30,000
deer can cause quite a quite an

109
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,160
impact um in addition invasive plants

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,639
are also responding to changes in

111
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,759
landscape configuration so especially

112
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,280
over the last century both deer and

113
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,560
invasive plants have basically gotten a

114
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,079
huge Advantage by the effects that

115
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,720
humans have had on changing landscape

116
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,079
composition and

117
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,560
configuration so broadly my research

118
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:55,758
falls

119
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,800
into the overall overarching um field in

120
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,720
Ecology of community

121
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,360
assembly and

122
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,360
what I'm showing here is the three major

123
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,919
selection factors that go into

124
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,680
determining the local plant community so

125
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:16,038
first plant species must disperse and

126
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,560
move to a certain location and then they

127
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:22,079
must tolerate the environment there so

128
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,478
they must have a physiological tolerance

129
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:28,519
for that site and then within the

130
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:31,120
ecological species pool these species

131
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:32,879
compete and also must cope with natural

132
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,800
enemies such as deer in the case of

133
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,120
plant communities and only then will the

134
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,120
local plant community be realized so I'm

135
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,598
focusing my research in in this area

136
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,560
where I'm looking at the effect of deer

137
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:47,560
on on

138
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:55,680
Plants so spatially deer are responding

139
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,160
to the landscape by choosing which which

140
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,160
Landscapes and communities offer the

141
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,120
best foraging opportunities

142
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,800
and also weighing those against other

143
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,000
requirements they have for finding mates

144
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,680
and and

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,439
shelter so my research today I'll be

146
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:19,000
sharing uh occurred at three different

147
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:21,918
fosi so the first part of my work is at

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,918
the plant Community scale and the plant

149
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,439
Community level where I looked at

150
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:29,159
unfenced and fenced plots from across

151
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:33,000
the region and I'll be showing you those

152
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,120
results first then I zoomed in to look

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,639
at the deer to look at whether deer

154
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,240
preferences are helping to explain AB

155
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,319
plant abundance patterns that are

156
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,199
occurring in plant communities across

157
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:50,039
the region and then lastly I step back

158
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:53,400
to consider the context of landscape and

159
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:57,680
the effect of deer on introduced

160
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:59,799
plants so first across the region what

161
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,319
are the effects of deer on introduced

162
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,439
and native plants at the community

163
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:09,199
level so first I want to show you an

164
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:12,279
example of a fenced and unfenced plot

165
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,400
this is a fenced plot on the

166
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:18,399
right and you could see a very clear

167
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,679
dividing line and this slide better than

168
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:24,198
the other and I have to say this deer

169
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,360
has been super imposed I just for for

170
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:31,000
illustrative

171
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:34,200
purposes um but in the plot on the left

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,479
you notice a lot of Japanese DT grass

173
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,120
and

174
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:41,200
this plant has grown almost all the way

175
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,918
up to the F the fence Edge and then it

176
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,879
completely almost completely stops in

177
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,958
this case there's hardly any Japanese

178
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,679
still grass occurring inside the fence

179
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,679
where deer have been excluded so this is

180
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,559
a really striking difference in the

181
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,439
plant Community composition and

182
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:58,639
structure and it appears that deer

183
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,720
browsing their selective browsing might

184
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,720
have facilitated The

185
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,799
Invasion so how might deer facilitate

186
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,120
plant Invasion again they're very

187
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,838
selective

188
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,600
browsers they browse only species they

189
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,720
find palatable and avoid other species

190
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,639
which then gain a competitive advantage

191
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,399
in the plant community so the effects of

192
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:25,799
deer include changing competitive

193
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,639
hierarchies in the plant communities and

194
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:32,399
this can have the result of limiting

195
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:34,919
Forest to understory diversity and

196
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,759
creating Windows of opportunity for

197
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:43,278
exotic plants to invade again there are

198
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:47,240
ecosystem processes that are influenced

199
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:51,360
and the decreasing stability in some of

200
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,639
those processes can again invite plant

201
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,560
Invasion so some Studies have already

202
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,639
looked at the effects of deer on

203
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:02,119
invasive plants showing that in many

204
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,078
cases dear increased plant Invasion such

205
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,240
as by increasing the cover of garlic

206
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,639
mustard and Japanese still grass however

207
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,399
at other

208
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,799
sites there have been no effects or

209
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,519
conflicting effects within studies such

210
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:20,159
as at one site multi Rose was increased

211
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:25,200
and at another site which happened to be

212
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:29,759
older it it was not the same um pattern

213
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,879
so the really interesting study is that

214
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,039
in some cases in this particular case

215
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,759
deer decreased Oriental Bittersweet

216
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,639
Oriental Bittersweet is another invasive

217
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,958
plant and it appeared that deer presence

218
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,639
actually decreased the

219
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,679
abundance so my work aims to bring

220
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,759
Clarity to some of these equivocal

221
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,120
results in the literature and also to

222
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:55,519
more broadly understand the role of deer

223
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,480
in plant Invasion across the region

224
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,639
whereas these sites these studies only

225
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,440
used one or two sites my intention was

226
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:07,399
to use sites from across the

227
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,959
region so this is a map of those of

228
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:14,360
those 24 sites

229
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:17,239
and I collected data at these two sites

230
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,079
in Northwestern Pennsylvania but again

231
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,680
like I said most of the data sets were

232
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:24,159
contributed by other

233
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,559
scientists in this first part of my work

234
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:29,958
I hypothesized that deer would alter

235
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:33,278
plant Community composition and doing so

236
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:36,078
they would facilitate plant Invasion and

237
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,759
of introduced plants and reduce the

238
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:42,278
abundance of native plants diversity and

239
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:47,439
abundance of native plants so the data

240
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:51,439
comprised 200 uh 229 paired plots so

241
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:55,200
that's a total of 458 plots across the

242
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:59,560
24 sites and although the experiments

243
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,120
varied quite widely in the purposes for

244
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,278
the experiment in the first place and

245
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,278
the

246
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,959
duration um all of the sites in had in

247
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:14,120
common that they had fenced and unfenced

248
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:16,719
plots not sure what's going on here

249
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,720
sorry about

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,519
that so the commonality was they all had

251
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,039
fenced and unfenced plots and they all

252
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:28,198
measured Woody and herbaceous

253
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:29,799
vegetation so the again the data sources

254
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:32,159
varied um

255
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,599
the duration of the experiments varied

256
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:38,639
but I'm controlling for that as you'll

257
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:41,360
see with a random effect approach

258
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,839
so using data from lots of different

259
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,360
sources can be very unwieldy and this

260
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,279
was a really big challenge particularly

261
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,360
in that different abundance plant

262
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:55,198
abundance metrics were used across the

263
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,919
the 24 data sets at 14 sites stem

264
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:59,799
density was used to estimate plant

265
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:02,838
abundance whereas in many other cover

266
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:06,559
was used or cover

267
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,560
classes or cover

268
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:13,360
classes so this is an example or of all

269
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,039
of

270
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,039
the Let Me mute

271
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:25,399
this okay we have some background noise

272
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,720
um so the these are the cover classes

273
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,320
used across the data sets and as you

274
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,720
could see they they've really really

275
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,199
varied from experiment to experiment so

276
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,360
I tried to combine all of the abundance

277
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:39,359
metrics into oh

278
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:50,399
boy yeah I might might be a Mac

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,159
issue it happens to

280
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:58,078
me gather windows do I want to do that

281
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,078
room yeah

282
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,759
okay so moving on to the data

283
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:13,719
analysis so to look at plant Community

284
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,120
composition I used an indicator species

285
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,480
analysis and this determines the species

286
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,440
that are associated with certain

287
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,959
treatments so in my case I'm looking at

288
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,079
the species that are associated with the

289
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:28,278
deer treatment plus deer in the control

290
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,758
plots and without deer in the fenced

291
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:34,159
plots

292
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:36,199
and to look at species and Community

293
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,240
levels I used mixed model analysis of

294
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:40,399
VAR

295
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,959
variants and looked at both plant

296
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
species and Community levels though

297
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,078
today I'll only have time to talk about

298
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,639
that plant Community level in addition

299
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:52,120
to um Community

300
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,000
composition so just briefly I used fixed

301
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,120
the fixed effect as deer but the random

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,879
effects were plot pair and sight so I'm

303
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,560
controlling for the within sight

304
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:02,799
variability

305
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:04,638
as well as between sight variability and

306
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,919
the between sight variability I think is

307
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,320
where a lot of um a lot of the noise

308
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,559
might come in if I wasn't controlling

309
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,560
for those as random

310
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:22,518
effects so first in summary about 700

311
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,838
plant taxa were recorded ac across the

312
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:29,879
24 sites 383 of those were Native and

313
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:32,440
111 were introduced plants and there's a

314
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:35,159
big gap there you'll notice a lot a lot

315
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,000
of the species unfortunately over 200

316
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:40,439
could not be identified down to species

317
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,159
level so that's that's a little bit

318
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,399
unfortunate but I think that tells us to

319
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:49,039
a certain degree where the state of our

320
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:50,399
taxonomy expertise lies in in going out

321
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,919
and collecting this

322
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:56,240
data um

323
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:58,439
unfortunately um that occurred but I'm

324
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,879
Focus so I'm focusing on the species

325
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,519
that we could identifi to to the level

326
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:08,278
of either being introduced or

327
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:11,240
native and about 18 species were present

328
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:13,000
in plots where deer occur two additional

329
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,079
species

330
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,159
were were apparent were occurring where

331
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,318
deer were excluded on average and those

332
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,078
were Native species you'll notice that

333
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:25,759
there were about three introduced plants

334
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:29,198
whether deer were present or not and

335
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,079
interestingly a lot of taxa were only

336
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:35,479
occurring where deer were present or

337
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:38,638
absent so 14% of the 700 taxa occurred

338
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,000
only where deer were were present not

339
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,198
occurring where deer were excluded and

340
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,198
then

341
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:49,039
similarly 18% of the species occurred

342
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:50,838
only where deer were absent so I'm

343
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,599
beginning to show you the differences

344
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:56,880
between deer and no deer plots and you

345
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,000
can already see that deer have a very

346
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:03,198
big impact on plant community

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,720
composition so first here I'm showing

348
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:08,279
you the indicator species analysis

349
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,759
results and I'm beginning with the six

350
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,558
species that are the six introduced

351
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:17,640
species that are indicators of deer

352
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:20,798
presence and you'll notice that three of

353
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,120
these six are considered highly invasive

354
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:27,078
and they're also

355
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:30,000
occurring across a lot of the 229 deer

356
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:32,480
plots and across a lot lot of the sites

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,798
so these are some of the most widely

358
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,038
spread invasive plants in in the region

359
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:39,038
in at least in Forest under

360
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:45,439
stories and the native spe there were

361
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,840
several native species associated with

362
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,320
deer so these are the species that

363
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:50,918
you're more likely to see across the

364
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,639
landscape and are more likely to persist

365
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:57,360
despite High deer

366
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:02,080
pressure and in contrast they're

367
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:04,038
occurring across many fewer of the plots

368
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,918
and sites so they're not as widely

369
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:07,558
distributed across across the region as

370
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,520
are the invasive

371
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:13,759
plants and these are some of the more

372
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:16,519
frequent species Oxalis clear weed

373
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:19,759
coralberry and stinging nettle so these

374
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:22,639
species are ones that I might consider

375
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:25,759
planting because they're probably going

376
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,520
to persist in the face of deer

377
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:32,440
better so as far as where deer were

378
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:35,000
excluded there were five introduced

379
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,240
plants strongly associated with with

380
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,599
that treatment and again three of them

381
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,159
happen to be three are considered highly

382
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:45,119
invasive and these are Japanese

383
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:46,480
honeysuckle bush Honeysuckle and

384
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,399
multiflor

385
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,839
Rose

386
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,440
and I have a picture of a bird on a

387
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,279
fence here because the birds might be

388
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,400
contributing to the presence of these

389
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,558
fleshy fruited species inside fenced

390
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,240
plot

391
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:04,158
Birds might preferentially land on the

392
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,240
fence because it's a perge point in

393
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:09,159
itself or within the plants that are

394
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,480
growing inside the fence which are much

395
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,919
the vegetation is much more dense inside

396
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,079
the plots so there are more perch points

397
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,840
so that might be one explanation why

398
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:21,759
there are fleshy fruited invasives

399
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:24,839
occurring in Forest understory mostly

400
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,839
Forest understory

401
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:32,079
plots so so far I had shown

402
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,918
six invasive plants that were associate

403
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:38,199
or three invasive plants associated with

404
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:41,038
no deer plots three associated with plot

405
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,200
with um the absence of deer but there

406
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:46,119
are 27 native plants associated with the

407
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,240
absence of deer suggesting that the

408
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:51,199
natives are more susceptible to Deer

409
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,640
brows than than the exotic plants and

410
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,880
these are some of the

411
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,360
more these are some of the more uh

412
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,600
frequent native species associated with

413
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:05,319
the absence of deer white ash spice bush

414
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:07,558
black cherry and even poison ivy

415
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:10,200
suggesting that deer might find these

416
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:13,038
species particularly palatable or in the

417
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,159
case of spice bush maybe birds are again

418
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:18,000
helping to disperse these species to

419
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,919
where deer have been excluded because of

420
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
additional perch

421
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,720
points so overall we're seeing big

422
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,119
differences in exotic uh introduced

423
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,440
plants and native plants the native

424
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:33,879
plants appear to be more impacted by

425
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,798
deer than than the introduced

426
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,840
plants at the community level I'm seeing

427
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:41,679
similar

428
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:44,639
results the introduced species richness

429
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,840
did not change whether deer were present

430
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,840
or not and a plant absolute introduced

431
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:54,359
plant abundance was also

432
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,678
unaffected and this corresponds to what

433
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:59,599
I was seeing in the indicator species

434
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,480
analysis results approximately the same

435
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,480
number of introduced plants are

436
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,798
associated with with each of those

437
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,759
treatments and there happen to be three

438
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:10,240
of each three in each of invasive

439
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:13,400
invasive

440
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,880
plants however deer had a big de had a

441
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,440
big negative impact on Native Plant

442
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,559
abundance and plant species richness

443
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,558
decreasing so deer decreased native

444
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:24,599
plant abundance in all three of the

445
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:27,278
abundance

446
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:30,879
metrics

447
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:33,759
and the again this is reflecting what I

448
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,640
was showing in the indicator species

449
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:41,000
analyses total plant species richness

450
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,759
and abundance also declined and mostly

451
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,599
that was due to the native plants so

452
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,759
there's a difference here in how deer

453
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:52,839
are impacting exotic plants and native

454
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:55,240
plants and it translates to a

455
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:59,359
proportional decrease or sorry a

456
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:04,558
proportional increase in the invaded

457
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:06,798
of um of plant communities so the

458
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,079
proportion of introduced plant cover and

459
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,480
midpoint is higher where deer are

460
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,879
present so even though deer didn't in

461
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,679
influence the absolute abundance of

462
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,480
exotic in introduced plants they're

463
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,360
increasing the relative abundance of

464
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,798
introduced plants so they're increasing

465
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:29,599
the degree of plant Invasion or in other

466
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:32,200
words the invaded of plant communities

467
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:35,119
this wasn't the same for plant stem

468
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,558
density and one explanation for this is

469
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,319
that deer might increase the foliage on

470
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:42,319
a plant but not necessarily kill the

471
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:44,759
stem so the stem might persist even

472
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:48,480
though the overall cover of that

473
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:51,158
individual's stem is is reduced so

474
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,200
there's a bigger deer effect on cover

475
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:56,480
than on stem density might be one way to

476
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,640
interpret

477
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,480
this so revisiting the hypothesis that I

478
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,200
I first laid out for this this

479
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,919
particular part of my research I did

480
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:11,038
find that deer alter plant Community

481
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,640
composition and a couple caveats in in

482
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,640
this second hypothesis deer facilitated

483
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,880
the invasion of some species and at the

484
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,120
community level they increased the

485
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:26,600
relative abundance of invasive plants

486
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:29,000
not absolute abundance and lastly there

487
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:31,558
were definitely reductions in native

488
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,079
plant diversity and abundance in the

489
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,678
face of

490
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:38,519
deer so my next question is whether deer

491
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,519
preferences can help explain some of

492
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,639
these patterns that I observed across

493
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,639
the

494
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:48,640
region so that's the second part of my

495
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,720
research I'm just going to show you show

496
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,360
this briefly I won't go through it all

497
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,079
but please uh ask me questions about

498
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:58,558
this particular project because this was

499
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:01,519
a really interesting and uh and fun

500
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:05,200
experiment I set up uh deer preference

501
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:07,720
trials at the deer deer pens at at Penn

502
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,798
State where they have captive deer and I

503
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,278
use 15 different plant

504
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:13,679
species offered to the deer in a

505
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:17,480
cafeteria

506
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,519
style uh multiple choice preference

507
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,599
trial so I used introduced species and

508
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:24,519
Native species some that were expected

509
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:27,158
to be palatable others that were

510
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:32,879
expected to be unpalatable for both

511
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:36,440
groups and and I'll show you an example

512
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,720
of the feeding let's see if this video

513
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,720
will

514
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,759
work they didn't always feed at the same

515
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:46,759
time but there were always two deer in

516
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:50,079
the pen they were too scared to be in a

517
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:51,720
pen alone as it turns out so they didn't

518
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,079
have regular

519
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,038
feeding you could see them

520
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:59,000
eating Blackberry here and honeysuckle

521
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,839
here

522
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,640
honeysuckle turned out to be one of

523
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,639
their

524
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,640
favorites

525
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,880
surprisingly so I'm showing you the

526
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,399
results here based on the El an

527
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,240
electivity index which takes into

528
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:17,719
account the total amount of biomass

529
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,960
offered within each trial and the amount

530
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,839
of biomass offered for each individual

531
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,440
plant and it takes into account how much

532
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:27,918
was eaten of each species relative to

533
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,840
the other species so a positive value

534
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,480
indicat Ates that the deer preferred

535
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:35,158
that species zero indicates random

536
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,599
feeding or feeding in proportion to that

537
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:40,120
amount offered and zero indicates the

538
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:43,158
plant was avoided so here I'm just

539
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:45,719
showing the overall

540
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,760
results and you can see that the

541
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,000
invasive introduced species on average

542
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:53,679
tended to be more avoided than the

543
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,159
native species which especially in the

544
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,960
spring were more often selected than the

545
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:02,278
invasive introduced

546
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:07,120
species but there was a an interaction

547
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:09,640
at the level of season and species so

548
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,199
I'm showing here the results the same

549
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:16,080
results but with

550
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:19,080
species uh you'll see the 15 species

551
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:22,319
that I included in the trials on the

552
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:25,558
bottom and within each group invasive

553
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:29,839
and Native I saw an increasing I saw

554
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:32,359
quite a quite a a range of plant palet

555
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,879
abilities and deer preferences for these

556
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:37,918
plants and I've arranged them here

557
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,278
according to Deer preference within each

558
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,919
group I could talk a lot about deer

559
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:44,440
preferences and the particular plant

560
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,679
traits but I'm just going to focus on

561
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,720
the most preferred and the most avoided

562
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,159
species so Bush

563
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,399
honeysuckle European privet and Oriental

564
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,880
bitters were the most preferred species

565
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:57,000
and again you'll notice these all have

566
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,840
fleshy

567
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,119
fruits and of the Native species red

568
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:06,959
maple was uh a little bit of a surprise

569
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:09,558
to find that it was the most palatable

570
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,360
of of the natives there in the

571
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,720
literature there have been suggestions

572
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,798
that it's not that palatable of a

573
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,200
species but again this is all relative

574
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:21,240
to just these species that I included in

575
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,080
the trials and the deer were not starved

576
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:27,759
just so you know they had plenty of hay

577
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:31,398
and regular food but so these were all

578
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:34,359
somewhat of treats given they were given

579
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:37,519
an opportunity to have some some real

580
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:40,359
plant material not just hay and

581
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,879
pellets so of the species that were

582
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:45,678
avoided Japanese stilt grass garlic

583
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,799
mustard and Japanese Barberry were

584
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,960
highly avoided and it seemed that based

585
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:55,480
on some additional data we collected of

586
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:58,640
the behavior deer behav feeding behavior

587
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,839
um it was quickly not the Deer quickly

588
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,640
learned that these species were ones to

589
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:04,798
be

590
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:07,440
avoided and this might explain why in

591
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,359
the across the region we're seeing that

592
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,679
these species increase in the face of

593
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:14,918
deer they're unpalatable they're avoided

594
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,880
relative to other species so they gain a

595
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,919
competitive advantage in the plant

596
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,200
community and of the Native species

597
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:27,120
hended Fern was the least palatable and

598
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,519
this is interesting because it it's a

599
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,518
species that has has been noted as a a

600
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,679
native

601
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:37,798
Invader and this is one of the 24 deer

602
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,159
research sites this is in Northwestern

603
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:42,639
Pennsylvania where you can see the fenc

604
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,159
plot kind of tried to outline that on

605
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:50,399
the left where there a lot more plants

606
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:52,320
shrubs and yet where deer are occurring

607
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,398
there's a lot of Hast ended Fern there

608
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:58,278
are no introduced plants at this at this

609
00:28:55,398 --> 00:29:00,959
site but there is a lot of hended fern

610
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,960
so I think one point we might take from

611
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,720
this is that

612
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,399
deer can cause an increase in a plant

613
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,159
species whether it's native or

614
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:13,479
introduced if that plant is unpalatable

615
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:16,880
so the unpalatability seems to be more

616
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:20,640
important than the than whether the

617
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,840
plant was introduced or not so deer are

618
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,880
making choices at the species level not

619
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:26,879
at the level of introduced or

620
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:32,278
native so just to sum up this this deer

621
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,640
preference section yes deer feeding

622
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:36,599
preferences can help us understand

623
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,120
what's going on in the plant communities

624
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,158
across the region as far as plants that

625
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,079
increase or decrease in the face of deer

626
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,600
and deer preferences vary the species

627
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:51,240
level not at the native introduced level

628
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:54,519
and the process of plant Invasion can

629
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,679
really be informed by understanding the

630
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:00,038
processes going on at this very small

631
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,038
patch level

632
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,640
so at the in this last part of my

633
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:08,158
research I just wanted to share a little

634
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,640
bit of my findings based on interactions

635
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,559
that are occurring between deer and

636
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,519
Landscape configuration so deer aren't

637
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:20,079
interacting with plant communities in a

638
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,519
bubble there are other factors going on

639
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,918
surrounding these

640
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,960
sites so what is the importance of deer

641
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,399
given the context of landscape

642
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,319
fragmentation so I'm stepping back here

643
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:33,678
looking at the landscape scale and what

644
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,439
do I mean by

645
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,480
fragmentation well first it can imply a

646
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,640
loss of habitat changing landscape

647
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,558
composition such as forests being

648
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,679
replaced by AGG or developed land cover

649
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:50,798
and also fragmentation imp implies

650
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,840
broken apart landscape patches such as a

651
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:56,038
decrease in patch connectivity and

652
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:58,798
increasing Edge habitat which I

653
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:00,919
mentioned is something that facilitates

654
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,398
both deer and invasive

655
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:05,960
plants so briefly uh these are the

656
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:09,079
metrics that I used to describe

657
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,600
landscape fragmentation both landscape

658
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:15,359
structure and Landscape composition

659
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:18,158
metrics I think I should move on and not

660
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:21,519
talk too much about this right

661
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,360
now but again deer and invasive plants

662
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,919
are responding to landscape

663
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:28,879
fragmentation and it seems that

664
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,399
because year were're shown to have

665
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,799
impacts on plant communities across the

666
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:36,678
region that this is something we should

667
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,398
really consider what's the what's going

668
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:42,559
on surrounding the

669
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:44,518
sites so I hypothesized here that both

670
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:47,839
landscape attributes and deer would

671
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,919
jointly influence plant Invasion and

672
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,199
high deer density not just deer presence

673
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,840
or absence which I only focused on in

674
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,840
the first part of my research will

675
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,278
increase plant

676
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:01,798
invasion so I used the data the same

677
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,359
data from the 24 deer research sites and

678
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:07,240
each site had an independent estimate of

679
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:10,398
the number of deer per square kilometer

680
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:13,599
at each of the sites so I use those data

681
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:17,079
as well as national land cover data

682
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:19,638
which I and I used many so I used many

683
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:21,798
Landscapes um to describe the

684
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:23,479
surrounding fragmentation at each of

685
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:27,359
these

686
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,120
sites for instance this is the itha land

687
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,119
cover top

688
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,798
you'll see the airport the

689
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:36,239
mall and there's a deer exclosure site

690
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:37,798
located right here within this within

691
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,720
this

692
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:42,720
landscape the pink and the the red are

693
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,200
developed cover as you can see Cornell

694
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,319
is down here near the edge and yellow

695
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,440
and brown represent the agricultural

696
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:52,918
land cover while green represents

697
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,720
forested

698
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:59,480
cover so this is the whole range of

699
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,120
Landscapes surrounding the 24 sites and

700
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,278
you can see they range broadly in the

701
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:06,918
amount of forested cover agricultural

702
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:09,798
cover and developed cover some of them

703
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:13,440
are much closer to centers of human High

704
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:16,200
human population density and some are

705
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,558
very isolated from the influence of

706
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,200
humans some of these sites had no

707
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,440
introduced plants at all others had many

708
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,399
introduced

709
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:30,240
plants so I used several different um

710
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:32,918
approaches um to analyze this data um

711
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,278
I'm just going to focus on some results

712
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:39,399
from mix models and regression but I'll

713
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:42,599
give you a summary of of the overall

714
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:45,278
results um ordination visualizations

715
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:46,879
helped me see that there are multiple

716
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:51,440
invasive plants occurring at a lot of

717
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,679
these sites and the sites have or the

718
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,159
the plots are much more similar in

719
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,759
community composition to others within

720
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,480
that site than across site so each of

721
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:03,398
the sites are very different in plant

722
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:06,038
Community

723
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:08,759
composition um as far as what I found

724
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:11,159
from random Forest results um this is a

725
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,119
regression tree analysis-based

726
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,919
approach um to look at the relative

727
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,919
importance of different fact of

728
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,319
different

729
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:21,440
variables and I found that landscape

730
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,000
fragmentation metrics and Native species

731
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,000
richness were more strongly associated

732
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,639
with plant Invasion metrics than was

733
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,800
deer present

734
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,079
absence so that tells you something

735
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,440
right there at the landscape level

736
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,519
perhaps the effect of deer isn't isn't

737
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,720
as

738
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,079
important

739
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,279
and exotic species richness

740
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,480
interestingly was explained largely by

741
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,240
landscape factors but also by native

742
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,358
species richness and in this model I had

743
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:57,799
a very high r squar value so leads me to

744
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,799
think that these three factors are are

745
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,280
quite important in understanding the

746
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,920
number of species the number of exotic

747
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,720
species at of

748
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,400
sight um however there in the mixed

749
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:11,838
model analyses there were interactions

750
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,358
among deer presence absence the

751
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,159
fragmentation metrics and Native species

752
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:19,159
richness so I'm going to show you one

753
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:22,799
example of that

754
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:23,838
here um overall as agricultural land

755
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,320
cover

756
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:31,279
increases the invasion in in this case

757
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,519
it's the percent of introduced stems or

758
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,040
the proportion of the stems that are

759
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:38,358
introduced increased with agricultural

760
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:40,880
cover so overall there's there's a

761
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:43,799
there's a positive relationship

762
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,760
here but within each of the

763
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,599
sites the effect of deer plays an

764
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,319
important role this interaction was

765
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:54,318
significant between deer and

766
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:59,000
agricultural cover so at the sites where

767
00:35:54,318 --> 00:36:02,719
AG cover is minimal mostly forested

768
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,119
sites we're seeing that the number of

769
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:08,519
introduced stems the percentage of

770
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:12,920
introduced stems is higher than where

771
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:14,679
agricultural land cover is much greater

772
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,280
so there's a switch you see the white

773
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:19,639
symbols are greater than the great

774
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,960
higher than the gray symbols where a

775
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:23,838
cover is low and the opposite where eye

776
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,280
cover is high so what might be causing

777
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,759
this

778
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,359
relationship one explanation is that the

779
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,000
Invaders the invasive species vary

780
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:37,440
across this across this gradient and

781
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,039
indeed at these sites where deer were

782
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,200
present Japanese stilt grass and garlic

783
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:47,480
mustard were the in were the Invaders

784
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:50,318
whereas in the agricultural higher

785
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,599
agricultural um land cover M um

786
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:55,440
Landscapes these species Japanese

787
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:58,920
Honeysuckle and multiflor rows are more

788
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,119
abundant where deer have been excluded

789
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,240
and again I think this might be a result

790
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,240
of bird dispersal um these species are

791
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,719
more common along edges and an open

792
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:11,439
habitat so it's not surprising that the

793
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:16,559
propal pressure of these species would

794
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:20,679
be higher in a landscape covered um more

795
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:20,679
by Agricultural and open open

796
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:26,960
land and to look at not just deer

797
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,720
presence absence but also to make use of

798
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,760
the deer Den density data that was

799
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:35,159
available I found that as deer density

800
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:39,720
increased so did the cover of introduced

801
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:43,118
plants and the percent of introduced

802
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:45,039
species this wasn't found for all of the

803
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,680
metrics that I used to look at plant

804
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:51,519
Invasion but it was um a significant

805
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:54,519
relationship here suggesting that deer

806
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:57,960
density does make a

807
00:37:54,519 --> 00:38:00,639
difference um so overall um in

808
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,639
revisiting the

809
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:06,199
hypothesis landscape attributes and deer

810
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:09,239
present were both important and

811
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:12,279
considering landscape configuration and

812
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:15,399
deer preference and deer presence we can

813
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:20,160
more fully understand what's going on

814
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:23,920
with with uh uh plant Invasion

815
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:26,039
and just a couple final points here the

816
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,079
surrounding landscape composition can

817
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:31,960
help explain why some sites are invaded

818
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:34,079
and others are not and we get a much

819
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,000
better understanding of plant Invasion

820
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,519
by considering the factors going on at a

821
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,519
landscape

822
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:44,119
scale so in conclusion deer increased

823
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:47,119
the abundance of several invasive plants

824
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,680
but reduce others deer are indirectly

825
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,960
facilitating plant Invasion because of

826
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:57,598
the major decrease they have they have

827
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,800
in native plants and deer preferences

828
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,240
are helping to explain those

829
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,560
patterns and then at the landscape scale

830
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:08,799
both deer abundance and exotic plant or

831
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,759
introduced plant Invasion are linked to

832
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,200
the overarching structure and

833
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:17,560
composition of of the surrounding

834
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:20,358
landscape and Invaders differ according

835
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:22,519
to both the landscape and according to

836
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:26,480
Deer preferences so I think considering

837
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:28,679
both of these is is really important um

838
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,000
understanding the plant Invasion process

839
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:36,078
is strengthened when we examine it in

840
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,039
light of co-occurring multiscalar um

841
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,960
ecological patterns and processes such

842
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:43,400
as landscape fragmentation and

843
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,000
increasing deer

844
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,039
populations so perhaps Forest

845
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,838
fragmentation and deer browsing are the

846
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:52,599
ultimate drivers of a lot of the

847
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,679
ecosystem changes that we see in

848
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:58,119
association with plant

849
00:39:54,679 --> 00:40:00,239
Invasion so it's just I think important

850
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:01,880
to think a little bit broadly about

851
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,479
whether it's really the plants that are

852
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,920
driving these changes or they or are

853
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,400
they just passengers kind of along for

854
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:13,358
the ride as a result of other changes

855
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,318
and lastly managing invasive plants

856
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:19,119
might be ineffective unless we're also

857
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:21,800
managing for changes in landscape

858
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,920
structure and composition and the

859
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,920
increasing deer

860
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:31,039
populations so maybe one way to ask a

861
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,599
final question is what's more desirable

862
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,679
having very little growing where there's

863
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,519
very clear browse lines and Forest under

864
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:41,000
stories or having introduced plants

865
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:45,280
growing so of course this is kind of an

866
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,760
exaggerated either or but I think

867
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,960
because there's an opp window of

868
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,480
opportunity in a lot of forest underst

869
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,318
stories because of the high deer

870
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,920
pressure the result is having invasive

871
00:40:54,318 --> 00:41:00,719
plants but maybe the invasive plants

872
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,400
have some are offering some services

873
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:05,399
that we've we've overlooked and Anton

874
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,760
and I have talked about how that might

875
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,318
be uh an interesting path to go down

876
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,839
from here

877
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:16,039
on so with that I hope

878
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:19,239
there are minutes for questions but it

879
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:22,719
doesn't look like there are um if anyone

880
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:24,959
has anything they'd like to ask me now

881
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:29,239
or later I'd be

882
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,240
happy to answer

883
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,200
yeah if um honey suckle and and M FL

884
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,880
rows

885
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,879
are so desirable from the deer's point

886
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,280
of view why are they so abundant in land

887
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,440
yeah I've thought about that a lot um

888
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,280
over the year over the past few years

889
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,480
and one explanation is that there're

890
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:58,000
typically higher light environment

891
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:59,599
species and whereas I studied a lot of

892
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,199
I study the plant communities and forest

893
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,920
underst stories for the most part there

894
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:06,838
might be a difference there between

895
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,599
highlight and and low light environments

896
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:11,719
I think in highlight environments those

897
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:14,200
species tend to grow really quickly so

898
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:17,078
they might just be able to outgrow any

899
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:19,279
of the deer browsing that occurs in

900
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:23,079
those open habitats because I have

901
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,200
noticed in walking through Fields even

902
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:27,280
that there is deer brows occurring on

903
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:29,799
those species but maybe it's just not

904
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,960
enough the deer don't want to eat 100%

905
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:39,119
of their diet of one shrubby invasive

906
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,119
plant they can only eat so much of of

907
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:47,079
it I think one of the issues of deer

908
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:50,519
pressure is actually Forest regeneration

909
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:52,160
so are there lessons from your study or

910
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:56,440
that would

911
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:58,679
relate yeah definitely um I think the

912
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,400
high deer pressure

913
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:04,879
is a really big concern in reducing the

914
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:08,760
native the native species that we'd

915
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:11,640
prefer to regenerate the forests um

916
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:14,440
instead it looks like there are a couple

917
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:17,598
exotic trees that might are invasive

918
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:21,240
trees that might be taking the place of

919
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,760
our native trees um but yeah I think

920
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:27,639
it's my research really just supports

921
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:30,920
the the fact that tree regeneration

922
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:34,039
is a big concern native trees just are

923
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,400
at a disadvantage given the really high

924
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:36,400
deer

925
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,920
densities that's sort of a related

926
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:42,439
question

927
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,680
about

928
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:49,280
um you know the Regeneration of of

929
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:51,078
canopy trees and I'm wondering in your

930
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,280
analysis you know some of these trees

931
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:56,240
are too big for the be so they're

932
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,640
whatever is controlling their cover is

933
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:01,078
is not

934
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:04,159
um so I'm wondering in your analysis you

935
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:06,920
focusing just on under species that the

936
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:09,118
could actually yes yes I was just

937
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,680
focusing on what's going on in the

938
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:16,240
underst story although some of the

939
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:19,318
species were you know black cherry maple

940
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:20,838
and Oak in in the underst story but

941
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:22,079
those species were much more common

942
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:24,318
where deer were

943
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,200
excluded yeah I'm kind of related to

944
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:28,199
that I guess it seems like I don't know

945
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:31,199
if you explicit looked you just

946
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:33,000
mentioned High light environments but it

947
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:35,719
seems like you know the HED Fern is

948
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,280
coming in there there's light reaching

949
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:39,598
the fourth floor

950
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,480
right so I don't know if you looked at

951
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,680
that

952
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:47,599
independently I didn't specifically look

953
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:51,318
at light environment um yeah so the

954
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:54,640
comments I was making earlier anecdotal

955
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:57,599
um it seems that

956
00:44:54,639 --> 00:45:01,199
highlight could increase certain

957
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:04,039
invasive plants um but a lot of these

958
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:06,679
unpalatable species that are more common

959
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:11,000
such as the Japanese tilt grass and

960
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:12,919
garlic mustard are tolerant of low light

961
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,760
but I think they must have those anti-

962
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,358
erbivore

963
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,319
characteristics in order to to persist

964
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:21,558
even in the face of

965
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:23,239
deer okay one last question

966
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:26,680
Janice

967
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:29,358
de um on your first point there there

968
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:31,480
have been some studies showing that deer

969
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,799
are dispersing a lot of these invasive

970
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,079
plants including Japanese still grass

971
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,880
which was a big surprise to me but

972
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,920
definitely the fleshy FL fruited species

973
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,358
they're dispersing those into the into

974
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,639
the forest across the landscape um as

975
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:49,199
far as which species to plant I mean

976
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:53,000
definitely put up a fence around

977
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:57,759
anything you find really prized that's

978
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,760
what we've resorted to

979
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:03,799
Steve a quick

980
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,559
question not be quick but uh what how

981
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,240
does your work compared to what's

982
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:09,440
happened out in other like out in the

983
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:11,838
west there's obviously different

984
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,639
invasive plant species there and de

985
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:17,039
having an impact there have you compared

986
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:19,000
this ecosystem with other ecosystems and

987
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,960
and what's happening

988
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,440
elsewhere um just looking at the

989
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:28,838
literature it seems like my research is

990
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,519
in support of or are um congruent with a

991
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:33,519
lot of the other findings deer generally

992
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,639
reduced the palatable species increase

993
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:38,838
unpalatable species and if the

994
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:42,199
unpalatable species is exotic it

995
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:45,440
definitely Garners more attention and I

996
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:47,279
think what my research suggests and

997
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,639
especially with the hended fern and

998
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,160
there's other other literature too to

999
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:57,000
back up the hended fern native Invader

1000
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:59,519
um kind of point so um yeah overall I I

1001
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,039
think they're pretty similar in

1002
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:06,280
findings one difference might be if not

1003
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:08,838
just abundant herbivores are considered

1004
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,960
but just herbivores in general and

1005
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:15,199
herbivores in general actually have

1006
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:17,358
somewhat different patterns but with

1007
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:20,719
deer in our case they're very very

1008
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:22,759
abundant so it's a little bit of a a

1009
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:26,318
different scenario when you consider a

1010
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,640
highly abundant native um species such

1011
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:29,880
as deer
