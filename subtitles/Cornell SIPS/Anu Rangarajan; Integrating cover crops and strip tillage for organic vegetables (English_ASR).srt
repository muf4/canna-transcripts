1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,469
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:08,710
University

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:10,359
welcome everyone I'm picking up a little

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,800
flash flash hopefully they'll be in

5
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:13,689
sight that goes with it oh it's this

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,640
light okay

7
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:18,039
I wanted to share with you some of the

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,859
work that we've been doing here at

9
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,599
Cornell focusing on reducing tillage

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,359
it's it's a collaboration that goes

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,460
across several universities in sort of

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,829
regions as we have a partner in Michigan

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,900
where you have some faculty there Dan

14
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:34,359
Brainard and Sophia xandrie who are on

15
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,799
our project and so some of the process

16
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:37,839
some of the experiments that we're doing

17
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:40,419
here in New York are repeated there as

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,739
well as mark Hutton who's here another

19
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,640
collaborator up in Maine and along with

20
00:00:41,738 --> 00:00:47,878
Eric gallant and so this work out what I

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,289
want to share with you is focused in on

22
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:53,079
trying to integrate cover crops into

23
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:55,929
strip tilled systems and so a reduced

24
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,039
tillage system in organic vegetables but

25
00:00:55,929 --> 00:01:00,399
we've been working with organic

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,750
vegetables in trying to adapt reduced

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,910
tillage systems to them for many years

28
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,099
and started our work primarily in

29
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:07,599
conventional conventionally managed

30
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:09,099
vegetables and a lot of that was funded

31
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,769
with sare but now we're trying to sort

32
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:13,719
of see how can we adapt and integrate

33
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:16,629
these systems for organic vegetables and

34
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,549
without the tools that our conventional

35
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:20,079
growers have with herbicides one of our

36
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:22,390
most important concerns and

37
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,009
considerations is how do we design these

38
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,859
with cover crops so we can actually be

39
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:29,140
managing weeds well in the system so

40
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:31,239
when I talk about reducing tillage we're

41
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,129
focusing on and we use reduced tillage

42
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:34,659
we're not doing a straight no-till here

43
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:36,399
we're looking at trying to decrease the

44
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:39,009
intensity the frequency and depth of

45
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,450
tillage or soil disturbance over time so

46
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,890
there are some systems that people work

47
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,478
on that are looking at rotational

48
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,129
tillage where you're playing rotate

49
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,829
tillage at certain parts of your

50
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:49,988
rotation and in our case we're primarily

51
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:54,009
are focusing on strip tillage we use a

52
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:56,289
number firth type a deep zone tiller and

53
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:58,170
this is a tool that creates an arrow and

54
00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:01,420
a restricted area of soil disturbance

55
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,459
you have on this if you've not seen one

56
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,560
of these before the implement itself has

57
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:08,140
a cutting culture to cut through residue

58
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,330
and then a shank that you said to

59
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,158
operate below a compacted layer of soil

60
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,489
and so the goal is to fracture the

61
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:17,039
compacted layer compacted soil and then

62
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:21,090
you have a cup of

63
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,889
this here of that actually help break up

64
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,359
and create a nice little mound of soil

65
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:25,798
that would be right in the area where

66
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:27,959
you're planting so you're trying to

67
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:30,590
create all of your tillage and soil

68
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,420
disturbance in a narrow band of soil

69
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,878
that is prepared for planting direct

70
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,649
seeding or transplanting and so we opted

71
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:40,438
for this in our area which is more of

72
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,879
the northern tier because we wanted to

73
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:45,000
make sure with vegetables that we

74
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:45,959
couldn't protect the early season

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,810
establishment

76
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,030
so having soils warm quickly and having

77
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,060
the crop get to a good start so we're

78
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,908
not seeing a delay in the actual crop a

79
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,680
lot of vegetable crops aren't always as

80
00:02:56,908 --> 00:03:00,840
vigorous and Hardy is some of the field

81
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,019
crops and so trying to optimize those

82
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,729
conditions early on so and the other

83
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,349
thing about the strip tillage is it

84
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:09,149
because it is it's sort of compromised

85
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:11,938
where it's not a straight no-till we do

86
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,519
have some different advantages to the

87
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:16,888
system we're restricting the tillage to

88
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,530
that in row area and so soils are

89
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:21,030
warming they're more quickly we can get

90
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,799
increased mineralization rates because

91
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,109
we do have disturbance there and so

92
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,439
we're adding air oxygen and disturbing

93
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:31,290
the soil there's a better seed bed for

94
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,329
like I said for seeding into in some

95
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:35,728
cases we can incorporate fertilizers if

96
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:36,959
they're actually in that area and in

97
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:38,069
some of our work with conventional

98
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,469
growers we're able to actually apply

99
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:42,089
fertilizer behind the shank deep into

100
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:45,000
the soil so it's available to the crop

101
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,280
and you're dealing with compaction in

102
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,378
that area it also allows us to sort of

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,509
keep this undisturbed area between there

104
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:53,128
where if we have a cover crop we can

105
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:58,649
retain a multi on the surface of the

106
00:03:53,128 --> 00:04:01,948
soil which can help us actually conserve

107
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,079
some soil moisture and ideally protect

108
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:06,540
from erosion protect from water movement

109
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,340
across the field very quickly as well as

110
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,959
creating this habitat for beneficial

111
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,229
Zoar pests

112
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,840
we've seen some evoke and generally

113
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,639
contributing to soil health so that's

114
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,788
some of the advantages but it does have

115
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,750
its disadvantages as well because

116
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:23,908
certainly when we're trying to manage

117
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,218
that residue and we're restricting the

118
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:27,870
width of our tillage we can still deal

119
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:30,209
with problems with residue getting

120
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,899
accumulating in that area making it

121
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,728
difficult

122
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:34,379
create the kind of seedbed we want and

123
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:36,539
so this is one of our big challenge with

124
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,759
cover crop integration into a strip till

125
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,460
is cover crops can still end up either

126
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,750
being pinned or the root balls of

127
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:45,508
themselves will create interference

128
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:49,168
despite that and the activity of that

129
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:51,750
tool and so as a result you can have

130
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:53,219
some problems with stand four seeds fell

131
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,360
contact if you still don't have an

132
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,610
optimized soil condition for getting a

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,939
good germination of some of our more

134
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,889
dense more a tender across and then cope

135
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:06,959
it so if they can be maybe 12 inches

136
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:09,269
wide that's tricky to cultivate in and

137
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,500
so we've been always we've been trying

138
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:13,469
different tools but how you actually

139
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,829
cultivator managed using equipment based

140
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,020
approaches in that narrow zone and then

141
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:20,550
between the row dealing with the residue

142
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,649
particularly if we have a really wet

143
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,329
year and you have that mulch in place

144
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:25,799
you still have to cultivate through it

145
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:29,219
so what are the tools that you have in

146
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,110
hand in order to pull that off and then

147
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,990
in some cases because we're not actually

148
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,490
disturbing the soils there and in

149
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,569
organic system word that would also

150
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,970
contribute to not having as much

151
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:41,399
nitrogen that's actually being

152
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,930
mineralized for the whole system for the

153
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,448
roots the crop to have available to it

154
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,939
so there are some challenges with it and

155
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:49,860
those are the what we've been trying to

156
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,469
explore and especially with organic

157
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,360
system we want to be able to reduce

158
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,050
tillage as part of that sort of overall

159
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,449
soil health approach and in order to

160
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,848
really advance it we can do this on a

161
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:04,889
bare ground we can reduce zone building

162
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:06,689
with bare soil and yes we can create

163
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:10,228
conditions fairly easy but as soon as we

164
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:12,180
add cover crops we had complications but

165
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:14,668
we know that when you stack these

166
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,470
approaches we have a more improved

167
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:18,120
benefit to soil health so that's what

168
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,610
our goal is to sort of figure how do we

169
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,220
integrate these four organic

170
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,069
so some of the basics around managing

171
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,960
cover crops for reduced tillage that are

172
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:29,580
sort of true in managing cover crops in

173
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,098
general that we're trying to seed at the

174
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,598
appropriate time to have a good biomass

175
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:36,269
that's going to provide some of the

176
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:38,459
benefits of cover crops in and

177
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:41,628
traditionally a lot of seasoned people

178
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:44,728
who use don't ill say kill early kill

179
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:46,439
effectively to try to manage the residue

180
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:48,718
but in our case with organic we're

181
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,939
trying to figure out how we have to wait

182
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:52,589
for that killing step in order to

183
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,349
actually terminate the cover so how do

184
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:57,628
we how do we deal with that in our case

185
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:59,279
we have chosen to do our work with flail

186
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:02,158
mowing we're not rolling in these

187
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,918
systems and so that's a distinction I

188
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:06,598
wanted to make for sure is that in a

189
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,339
rolled system where you have much more

190
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:10,529
cover and you're creating that solid mat

191
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,538
that tool wouldn't works you're in a

192
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:14,728
no-till system and in our case in the

193
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:18,418
more upper part of the Northeast our

194
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:20,788
soils are cooled are much cooler under

195
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:22,799
that system and other experiments in the

196
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:24,269
past haven't worked as well you can do

197
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,218
it with later planted crops like

198
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:30,839
squashes and sometimes with larger

199
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:32,668
seeded crops like sweet corn but you

200
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,189
have to delay your plant to make it work

201
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:37,258
and so we chose to work with the strip

202
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:39,810
till system that it's a compromise

203
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:43,500
between full width tillage and then

204
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:46,110
no-till and so one of the challenges

205
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,649
again is sort of to be able to have that

206
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,629
soil prepared and and the conditions

207
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:53,579
correct for actually being able to plant

208
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:56,490
into it and then manage the crop

209
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,800
optimize that yield but we in our

210
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,718
experiments we set this up to look at in

211
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,430
in the past we've looked at both winter

212
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:04,949
keeled cover crops using like okie

213
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,228
combinations and the nice thing about

214
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:08,400
using those in a reduced sale system is

215
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:09,418
that they're out of the way there you

216
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,218
don't have to deal with them in the

217
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:14,218
following year there are the residues

218
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:15,959
don't interfere but trying to really

219
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:18,509
optimize these systems for the winter

220
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,638
hardy type covers lebra like a cereal

221
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:22,050
rye in a vet this is where we have to

222
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,610
think carefully about our planning and

223
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:28,770
our management so the way we said about

224
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,348
to look at alternate management systems

225
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:33,478
for cover crops in in this particular

226
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:33,960
trial where we're integrating cover

227
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,330
crops

228
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,729
strip till is think about the ways that

229
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,190
we're terminating the cover and so we

230
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:42,479
had three treatments that we use for

231
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,180
termination

232
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,490
we used the traditional sort of flail

233
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:49,709
and drop the mulch leave the cover crop

234
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,299
in place and so we're calling that a

235
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,399
mulch treatment because it's basically

236
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:57,389
setting on the surface of the soil it's

237
00:08:53,399 --> 00:09:01,200
left in play another system is what we

238
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:03,449
call a cut and carry in which the covers

239
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,310
are flail top and then removed with a

240
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,839
wagon so their flail chopped into a

241
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:08,909
wagon and the residue is completely

242
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,350
removed from the field so the roots are

243
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:12,958
still intact but the serf the

244
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,269
above-ground biomass is gone so it

245
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,119
doesn't interfere then with practices

246
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:20,100
that happen later in the season and then

247
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,080
the third is sort of the control where

248
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,000
we would mow the cover crop but then

249
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,649
incorporate it with rototilling so then

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,659
the again the residues out of the way

251
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:31,230
but it's incorporated into the surface

252
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:33,569
of the soil so hopefully not interfering

253
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,870
with any of the other practice and we

254
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:39,959
looked at it with basically three kinds

255
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:44,100
of cover crop mixes in this case it was

256
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:46,109
we use the winter rye and hairy vetch we

257
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,240
also use a winter rye in a crimson

258
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,750
clover and then a straight hairy vetch

259
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,350
planting and so for each of those mixes

260
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:57,778
we use these different combinations of

261
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:00,750
termination strategy prior to then going

262
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:01,799
in and doing strip tillage so this is

263
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,778
the way that we're trying to see how we

264
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,729
can bring them together in these

265
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:07,500
experiments we also had a side dress

266
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,990
nitrogen application because in our

267
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,419
previous work in organic reduced Hill

268
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,519
nitrogen does appear limiting and so we

269
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:15,958
wanted to see how and if the

270
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,639
supplementary side res event would

271
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,479
actually address a limitation that

272
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:23,480
wasn't it all due to the tillage system

273
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,480
specifically

274
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:30,039
so um so those are that working with a

275
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,899
uniformly exceeded type of a mix where

276
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,519
you're mixing the Rye and the vets for

277
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,919
example and putting it across the field

278
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,319
as a mix whether it's drilled you have a

279
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,490
mix is one strategy but we also wanted

280
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,680
to look at what would happen if you

281
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:45,580
segregated your cover crops into strips

282
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:48,219
and so planting putting your legume

283
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:51,580
cover crop in the row where you intend

284
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,278
to plant and keep the cereal rye or the

285
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,710
the grain cover in between the rows you

286
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:58,990
maintain a residue there so trying to

287
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:02,830
optimize the spatial distribution of the

288
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:05,259
cover crop and also then facilitate

289
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:08,050
possibly the use of the strip tiller

290
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:10,389
in order to create the kind of zones

291
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:13,298
that we wanted for planting

292
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:14,798
so in this case it's generally here you

293
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:17,350
have this mix and when you have this

294
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:19,350
legume a legume and your cereal mixed

295
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,149
together your nitrogen is also

296
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:25,389
distributed from the legume across the

297
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:27,220
field but by creating and segregating it

298
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:28,928
where we're putting all of the legume a

299
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,459
right in the zone where we would strip

300
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:33,129
tail and plant the crop we try to

301
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:34,958
concentrate the nitrogen that's fixed by

302
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:38,259
that Liam into the area where the plant

303
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:42,008
the crop will be grown so we we just

304
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:43,839
felt that not only do we get the benefit

305
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:45,818
in this system of actually concentrating

306
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,439
the nitrogen many of those legumes are

307
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:49,719
easier to manage and the residue

308
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:51,730
wouldn't be as problematic in a strip

309
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,460
tilt system so there was two benefits

310
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,830
that can be explored with

311
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:00,580
so in order to look at the strip planted

312
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:02,680
we use the same cover crops we had

313
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,020
winter rye between the row and hairy

314
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,949
in the row a crimson clover in the

315
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:08,980
row or none

316
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,800
and so we maintained the serial the

317
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:14,019
winter rye in between and again in all

318
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:17,079
of these cases basically they were

319
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:20,740
planted in the fall and then flail mowed

320
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:23,278
and dropped in place and then strip the

321
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,709
zone builder was used in across the

322
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:29,169
field and in this case the zones were

323
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:31,778
built right over where the legume was

324
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:35,289
and so we sort of we created that sort

325
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:38,830
of plant racking and we seeded these

326
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:40,480
so again and there's a the mixes for all

327
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,220
of these mixes we had these three kinds

328
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,350
of termination but then in the case of

329
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,000
the strip planted we only we just failed

330
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,759
and then we stir it as own built and

331
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,830
then looked at how a cabbage crop would

332
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:55,059
perform so in all of these we use the

333
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:59,259
cabbage crop just an overview of a basic

334
00:12:55,059 --> 00:13:03,039
timeline was drilling the cover crops in

335
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:05,169
September and then in the spring mowing

336
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,029
the cover crop and then a couple of

337
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:08,709
weeks later zone building and planting

338
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:11,500
so the cover crops had some time to

339
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:15,400
actually dry now before we did the zone

340
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,929
building and the planting so these are

341
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:22,539
just a few pictures of the mulch system

342
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:24,189
so this is the mix of the Rye and the

343
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:25,539
hairy vetch this is typical what you

344
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:29,350
typically see when you're actually

345
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:32,679
planting these in the field the rate on

346
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,600
the Rye was a sixty pounds per acre and

347
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,059
then the vetch was at a twenty pound per

348
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,220
acre rate

349
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:40,409
and then this is what it looked like for

350
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,420
strip planting with nothing this is just

351
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:45,509
the Ryba tween the rose and then nothing

352
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:48,049
planted in the row and so where we would

353
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:48,049
zone build

354
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,649
is right in this area here so the zone

355
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,879
once this has been playable zone builder

356
00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:01,159
would be run right through this area and

357
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,528
then here's a neat picture where we have

358
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,230
the hairy vetch that's planted in the

359
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:07,909
area that we would be zone building and

360
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,409
then the crimson clover to give you an

361
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:11,860
idea of how it looked like prior to

362
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:11,860
terminus

363
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:19,899
and so first thing I wanted to share is

364
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,189
the overall biomass of the cover crops

365
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:24,789
just to give you a sense of how these

366
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:27,818
grew and this experiment in its design

367
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:31,019
was replicated also in Michigan with Dan

368
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:33,998
Brainard and so he was doing his

369
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:37,149
experiment on a sandy loam soil and this

370
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,798
is information from 2016 a dry year and

371
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:40,778
they were really challenged there

372
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:43,269
because of irrigation and the lack of

373
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:45,399
moisture and so you can see that their

374
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:47,110
biomass was much lower in their

375
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,808
experiment but when you look across what

376
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,459
we had at our trial that was in here in

377
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:55,958
the ethic area and free bill at our

378
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:58,208
organic research farm the cereal rye was

379
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:01,058
the bulk of the biomass and in fact

380
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:02,979
where we had just the veg crop a fairly

381
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:04,749
low biomass again this was just that

382
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,369
they had an oat nurse crop that went out

383
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:10,569
with it but it was just primarily betch

384
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:14,019
in the feet in the system and whether it

385
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:16,719
was stripped planted or if the and

386
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:18,938
the Rye were mixed and brought sort of

387
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,769
planted a uniformly across the field

388
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:22,928
about the same amount of biomass was

389
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:24,269
generated so there wasn't a big

390
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:29,068
difference in the amount of biomass

391
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:29,068
within a combination of cover crop

392
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,860
in the when we looked at the amount of

393
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:35,599
total nitrogen that was in the bio of

394
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,190
the above-ground biomass this is again

395
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,949
to give you a sense of the contribution

396
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:42,500
of the legume as well as the rai to the

397
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:43,969
subsequent crop because it did play out

398
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,389
in the performance of the crops

399
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:50,028
afterwards so having the straight

400
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:51,680
had the highest total amount of men in

401
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:53,929
the above-ground biomass so despite

402
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,328
having a fairly low total dry biomass

403
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:57,679
above-ground they still had more

404
00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:58,278
nitrogen that was contributed to the

405
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,099
system

406
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,948
and that is an important point that will

407
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:07,579
be carried out later on with the results

408
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:09,349
in but in the strip planted as well as

409
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:11,120
the mixed crops we had about half as

410
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,850
much of the nitrogen that's contributed

411
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,789
by the legumes and also some that was in

412
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:19,220
the riot self but that just gives you a

413
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:21,318
sense of the total amount of nitrogen

414
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,360
that was in this above-ground biomass of

415
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:24,588
the cover crops that doesn't have say

416
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,959
anything about what was happening below

417
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:28,600
ground but just as an estimate of

418
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,659
above-ground

419
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,659
you

420
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,659
and so again once we flail mold

421
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:39,559
everything we went through means own

422
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:41,958
built one of the challenges in trying to

423
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:43,909
do zone building especially with

424
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:48,469
something like rye is the a heavy amount

425
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:50,208
of residue and so having the right doing

426
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,399
some work with make sure you bro

427
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,899
cleaners in front of your implements is

428
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,198
really important especially in front of

429
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:58,399
the planter and it was it could be

430
00:16:57,198 --> 00:16:59,838
challenging this was a picture from

431
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,698
Michigan where they had it integrated

432
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,640
into their strip tool unit where they

433
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:07,158
could do the everything in one pass we

434
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,939
had to sometimes use a separate pass and

435
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:12,199
in the first year but having that that

436
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:14,000
row cleaner in front really was

437
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,890
important even though we might have

438
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,028
stripped planted it we still had to move

439
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,949
the residue out of the way

440
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:21,709
it's when you flail it still gets in the

441
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:24,970
way and it can still create not it can

442
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:27,230
impact how well that strip tiller works

443
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,970
but this is just a picture of how it

444
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,500
looks afterwards you have these bands

445
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,480
that are disturbed and ready for

446
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,970
planting after we've actually gone

447
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:40,169
through with the strip those o builder

448
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:42,210
and so depending on the mix of the cover

449
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:44,639
crop the residue lasted different

450
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:48,298
amounts of time over the season and so

451
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:50,758
we definitely in the case of the ryebeck

452
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:53,700
sort of at the beginning of the season

453
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:55,288
you can see a lot of that R is present

454
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,048
and it lasted quite a bit later this is

455
00:17:55,288 --> 00:18:01,109
in a dry year so it did actually have

456
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:02,970
some residual effect and in the past we

457
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:05,038
found about three weeks is the best we

458
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:08,038
get as far as weed suppression from an

459
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:12,058
in from a cover that's in the row after

460
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:14,099
it's been mowed so that's about it but

461
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:18,628
even in the Bechet did actually have

462
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:20,459
some residual veg but not very much and

463
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:23,329
so this is important when it comes to

464
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:28,850
dealing weed management passes and so

465
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:31,019
this year brian a caldwell who's here he

466
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:34,109
does all of our equipment work which

467
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:37,048
were really grateful for he we have had

468
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:40,619
a hillside rolling cultivator at the

469
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:43,200
farm and we use it in this strip till

470
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:45,658
system and it did a really good job of

471
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,600
being able to deal with between row

472
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:51,539
weeds and so you can see here b2 in the

473
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:54,089
zone you can see where the zone is where

474
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:56,548
this cabbage is but then in between that

475
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:59,158
rolling cultivator actually move through

476
00:18:56,548 --> 00:19:00,808
and and managed to actually do a really

477
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:04,830
nice job of cleaning up in between the

478
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:08,308
rows in spite of the remaining residue

479
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:10,439
that was there and that is um that is in

480
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:12,388
trying to put together the system it's

481
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,399
important you have to sort of think

482
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:16,740
through these pieces of it because it's

483
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:18,839
not just about adapting one part of the

484
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,339
system in order to make it work so

485
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,119
having the right road cleaners on

486
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:25,349
planters as well as on the zone tiller

487
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,209
having planned ahead for the weed

488
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:28,709
management strategy because dealing with

489
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,889
residue makes everything more

490
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,889
complicated

491
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:38,148
so this is just a picture of the

492
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:41,088
hillside that has these gangs of these

493
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:43,038
have this on them and you can adjust it

494
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:45,769
with hydraulics fairly small scale we do

495
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,719
everything on two rows I see all these

496
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:51,108
pictures from agronomic crops that are

497
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:55,058
much wider but we are we stay very

498
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:55,058
humble within our little to row system

499
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:02,579
so I just wanted to share here a little

500
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:05,038
bit about the nitrogen so I had shared I

501
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:07,859
told you earlier that you know in the

502
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,480
case of the veg a fairly high amount of

503
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:12,418
nitrogen was in the above-ground biomass

504
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,610
and when we rototilled that so these are

505
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,528
the three tillage systems the rototill

506
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:18,569
being the first bar then the cutting

507
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:21,990
carry where we actually flail chopped

508
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:24,178
and removed it and then verses the mulch

509
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,009
and was actually the traditional flail

510
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:29,009
drop it and then strip till it so that

511
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:32,638
residues on the surface that when in the

512
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:34,859
case of just post planting looking at

513
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:36,058
soil nitrogen levels that when we had

514
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,269
rode until the betcha

515
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:40,500
there was a real definitely a burst of

516
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:43,200
nitrogen that was mineralized and made

517
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,339
available to the crop right at planting

518
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,230
and that even carried through at the

519
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:52,019
time of side dress which is a few weeks

520
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,179
later so we still had the impact of that

521
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:58,500
practice in that management strategy

522
00:20:54,179 --> 00:21:00,179
with the hairy vetch only in there and

523
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,759
the other crop cover comes fairly low

524
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:06,100
levels of soluble nitrogen measured in

525
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:09,099
the soils in the planting zone

526
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:11,558
but when and we looked at the cabbage

527
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:13,480
biomass in the response and the cabbage

528
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:15,730
sort of reflected that same amount of

529
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,519
nitrogen that was available where in the

530
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:21,190
case of the bench with the high-end

531
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:25,749
contribution we saw again a rototilled a

532
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:27,519
higher amount a larger plant higher

533
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:29,278
growth rate but that didn't actually

534
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,868
carry through all the way to harvest

535
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:34,450
when it came to harvest and then we came

536
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:37,928
to our yields they all caught up at the

537
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:41,679
end as far as with the hairy vetch so

538
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:45,730
this is two years of data from this

539
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:49,330
experiment 2016 and 2017 hot off the

540
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:51,009
press we here's the first year in the

541
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:52,720
second year and the first thing I would

542
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,460
just suggest is that the patterns are

543
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,659
really similar over both years what we

544
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,269
observed with these cover crop

545
00:21:55,659 --> 00:22:02,590
combinations and these management

546
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:06,099
strategies so again the first bar would

547
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:08,499
represent the management rototill versus

548
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:10,269
the cut and carry and the mulch systems

549
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:12,579
where we just dropping it and leaving it

550
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:15,339
like a multi on the surface and this is

551
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:18,368
the and then our in this case we had the

552
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:22,329
the three different cover crops that we

553
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:23,949
compared the mix ryan hairy vetch makes

554
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:24,460
ryan comes in clover and a straight

555
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,619
bench

556
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:31,419
so when no nitrogen is applied basically

557
00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:33,038
these were not side dressed so this is

558
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:35,590
the part of the experiment we didn't do

559
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:38,519
any side dressing the veg definitely

560
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:41,408
stood out as supporting the best yield

561
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:44,108
compared to the ride veg mix and the Rye

562
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:47,080
crimson clover so if you look at in the

563
00:22:44,108 --> 00:22:49,839
case of just the bench at the management

564
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:52,210
system for that cover didn't matter we

565
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,699
had similar yields whether we wrote a

566
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:58,058
filled attend cover removed the

567
00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:00,069
above-ground biomass or we left it on

568
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:02,710
the surface as mulch and so this is like

569
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:05,648
the really traditional strip till and so

570
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:08,980
it's in whether it was the veg the Ryan

571
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:11,229
crimson clover here again no significant

572
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,690
difference between a traditional

573
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,909
rototilled approach to dealing with that

574
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:19,700
cover or a strip tilt so this is good

575
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:23,000
news yes and

576
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:26,289
and it was same in both ears and if we

577
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,170
compare the cover crop combination for

578
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:33,470
rototilled basically the vetch was

579
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:36,289
performing better than the other the

580
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,990
combinations occurred the Rye crimson

581
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:40,670
clover was definitely poorer performing

582
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,549
in these systems and one of our

583
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,529
challenges with that is the NIC is sort

584
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:47,329
of an artifact of the experimental

585
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:49,279
design and that we had to employ remote

586
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:51,019
everything on the same day if we had

587
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,190
optimize the time of kill we probably

588
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:55,759
would have had better performance than

589
00:23:52,190 --> 00:24:00,440
that and then when we looked at the

590
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:02,808
strip planted versus the mixed covers in

591
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,210
this case again here we have the bench

592
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:07,039
which is just a straight veg planet

593
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:10,850
across the field but it's included as a

594
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:13,428
nice comparison or a high nitrogen cover

595
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:16,369
and then and the other extreme we have a

596
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:18,559
rye with nothing no legume so you can

597
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:21,619
see here that the the light blue bars

598
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:23,359
are with no nitrogen applied it's a an

599
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:25,669
additional side dress and then with a

600
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,479
side dress nitrogen applied across all

601
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:30,980
of the cover crop mixes and so what

602
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,670
becomes really apparent is whether we

603
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:36,769
strip planted or a mix planted the cover

604
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:40,730
crops that the responses were sort of

605
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:43,819
were pretty much similar so the use of

606
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,890
that strip planted cover while it might

607
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:47,539
have provided some benefits to us as far

608
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,630
as being able to do the zone building

609
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:52,159
and actually implement the strategy

610
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:54,200
didn't result in much of a difference in

611
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,558
the yield compared to if we were just

612
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,029
mixing covers in a traditional way it's

613
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:00,740
kind of a bummer because we were really

614
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:04,339
thinking oh your hair on the track but

615
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,730
that's what we have learned here I'll I

616
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:09,379
think the other thing to note is that

617
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,640
we've always been concerned with organic

618
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,650
when we're restricting the width of

619
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,120
tillage through something like this that

620
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,309
we're not going to get all that nitrogen

621
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,019
mineralized through the disturbance of

622
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:20,690
soil that would be really important for

623
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:23,240
many of our vegetable crops and when we

624
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:25,460
did side dress we generally got a slight

625
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,589
improvement in we got an improvement in

626
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,960
the yield but it wasn't always

627
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:32,269
significantly different so for all of

628
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,710
these mixes in for veg adding that the

629
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:35,929
Supplemental side dress didn't really

630
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:39,590
improve the performance but for those

631
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:42,259
particular treatments where we were

632
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:44,329
really seeing a low nitrogen yes we did

633
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:48,319
see an improvement in the yields in

634
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:50,418
those cases so again this is year one

635
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,250
and year two very similar results in

636
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:55,100
Michigan where they had much drier

637
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,900
conditions a similar pattern they didn't

638
00:25:55,099 --> 00:26:00,230
have the best treatment like we did but

639
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:02,990
again seeing the same if they in their

640
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,419
case because they had such poor growth

641
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,849
in their cover crops they didn't have a

642
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:09,919
lot of nitrogen fix it was very dry that

643
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:11,149
it's really where they had nitrogen

644
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,610
added that they were actually able to

645
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:16,550
support yields and get enough yields

646
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:18,439
from the cover and so the interaction of

647
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:20,029
nitrogen supplementation depending on

648
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,049
conditions becomes really important to

649
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:23,049
make these systems work

650
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:28,369
so just in summary for where we're at

651
00:26:26,388 --> 00:26:30,079
with this work so again this is part of

652
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:31,579
a four-year project and this was two

653
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,990
years focused on strip till and cover

654
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:38,769
crops that our cabbage in a reduced till

655
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:42,048
system in the strip till did as well as

656
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:48,200
if we had read of tilled so we didn't

657
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:50,629
see we had similar yields in the strip

658
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,399
tilled and the rototilled sometimes with

659
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,320
a cotton carry system when we were

660
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:55,969
removing all that bug ground biomass we

661
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,500
did see a slight depression in the

662
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,839
performance of the cabbage in the yield

663
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,099
loss which is make some a sense if

664
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,490
that's actually contributing to the

665
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:06,230
nitrogen for the crop and then I didn't

666
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,829
show all of the combinations where we

667
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:12,019
added nitrogen but generally improved

668
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:13,428
the performance of the crop and I think

669
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:15,169
certainly in some years with more

670
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,330
rainfall where there could be other

671
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:19,909
stresses it's a logical thing to be

672
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:23,000
including a side rest application but we

673
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:25,639
didn't always see a yield benefit the

674
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,980
veg only cover crop really did optimize

675
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:30,798
the cabbage performance it which is

676
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,480
interesting because it's actually it

677
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:36,558
doesn't create as much residue that you

678
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,649
have to manage but we haven't looked at

679
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:41,839
other sort of benefits to soil health

680
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,398
and we didn't look at carbon or any of

681
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,250
the other indicators that might suggest

682
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:47,658
that you know to balance what are the

683
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:52,278
outcomes of using this cover crop

684
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:54,379
combination with reduced tilt and so the

685
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:55,940
strip tailed plan and covers helped but

686
00:27:54,378 --> 00:27:57,378
they didn't actually it wasn't that much

687
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,659
different well we thought it would help

688
00:27:57,378 --> 00:28:01,638
us really make the system work it wasn't

689
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:03,740
that big of an improvement and it

690
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,849
certainly didn't it facilitated the

691
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:08,149
reduced tillage but we didn't see a

692
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:10,519
difference in yield so that's kind of

693
00:28:08,148 --> 00:28:12,829
where we're at with it and just wanting

694
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,079
to highlight again the partnerships and

695
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:17,798
the research that's going on here across

696
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:17,798
these different institutions

697
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:25,289
and I want to call out Ryan Marr who

698
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:28,379
works in the program and Brian Caldwell

699
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:31,460
as well they are really the energy that

700
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,460
makes this whole thing roll

701
00:28:54,859 --> 00:29:02,399
so if we well we I think we we flailed

702
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:08,940
it and thisis so I think it would

703
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:11,370
probably rolled at the same time I think

704
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,610
that it's primarily the cold soils and

705
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:15,929
then the rolling restricts our ability

706
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:17,729
to do any kind of rescue with

707
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:21,360
cultivation later in the season so

708
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:23,099
that's one issue and those are the

709
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,449
primary ones to why we didn't roll and

710
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:26,789
we don't have a roller crimper that's

711
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,650
another one but I do have I have a

712
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:31,170
rolling stock chopper I mean I've tried

713
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:34,410
this in the past and worked with Steve

714
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,789
Groff back in in the 2000s where we

715
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:38,040
would actually roll covers using

716
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:41,819
different you know different ways of

717
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:44,190
chopping and rolling and crimping but in

718
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:46,679
an organic system where it's even more

719
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,390
I think restricted and the soil

720
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,470
temperature makes more it's more

721
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:58,620
important to me at this point

722
00:29:49,470 --> 00:30:03,019
now yes I've done it one way I think in

723
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:07,369
using a drill of blocking holes and so

724
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:07,369
no I don't tell me how is it

725
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:15,219
the cabbage is a 30 inch spacing and our

726
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:20,230
grain drill has 7 1/2 inch rows so

727
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:28,120
there's 4 rows corresponding to each row

728
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:33,480
cabbage so yes our drill has a large so

729
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:37,989
we could just block 2 rows to to the

730
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:40,150
holes for the large seed and put the

731
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,460
large seed through going between the

732
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:46,259
rows and then in the small C we would

733
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:46,259
block we would take off just the other

734
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,119
[Laughter]

735
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,269
there's other there's other like a cedar

736
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,400
that I've used in the past that we could

737
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:14,259
actually depends on where the auger is

738
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,610
in it and so if the auger is below the

739
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:18,250
seed box then we were able to actually

740
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:20,709
block fully and we could mix the thief

741
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,990
but when we did when we were doing hairy

742
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,269
vetch in the strip and Brian a strip we

743
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:28,930
had to mix oats with it to slow down the

744
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:31,089
flow so we created that's how we created

745
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,310
a bat we were able to regulate the rate

746
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:56,709
so we could get the rate of fetch that

747
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:57,940
we wanted this by using those so it's a

748
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:05,650
you're getting a really good thing

749
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:08,080
instead yeah so in

750
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:10,630
this experiment we aren't we aren't in

751
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:13,329
the same field in both years but in the

752
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:16,450
past when I've done experiments looking

753
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:19,629
with zone building in the same field we

754
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:21,759
go 15 inches we offset each year so well

755
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:23,230
strip the well Zone till in one area the

756
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,809
first year then we'll move to the middle

757
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,569
the next year and then experience

758
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:31,210
growers over time who are able to keep

759
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:33,519
with the system are able to actually

760
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:35,799
bring the shanks up so they're not

761
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,599
disturbing it's deeply over time so

762
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:40,089
they're moving from the deep zone til to

763
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:43,269
more of a shallow strip till system so

764
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:45,099
that is that is a way in which the field

765
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:47,519
or soils will adapt over time to the

766
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:47,519
system

767
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:55,428
