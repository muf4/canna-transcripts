00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,280
grow your own food if you can if you

2
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:12,559
can't support if you can't grow a lot of

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:15,678

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:18,239

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,359
a bunch of yankees y'all don't know

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,359
anything and y'all eat blueberries

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,760
rhubarb eaters i'm surrounded

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,200
figs grow well with no care at all in

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,600
the south they're predictable i made

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,920
these figs my children helped me pick

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,079
figs two weeks ago we made fig preserves

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,520
from their great great grandmother's

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,120
victory okay my kids know about climbing

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,920
in it they know about picking and all

17
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,000
that

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,440
sorting mouth getting you know the

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,079
getting the bad ones out cutting the

20
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,159
stems off all those details making fish

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,719
when the revolution comes my wife who's

22
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,319
a hot shot lawyer she says that lawyers

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,198
can be among the first to be lined up

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,118
and shot okay but people who can grow

25
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,000
food will be spared

26
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,239
okay

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,400
so my kids

28
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,839
know that they've been to vermont and

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,080
they know that they can get vermont

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,079
maple syrup and every pigley wiggly

31
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,840
y'all know what picky wiggly is

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,840
every pink new eagle in mississippi has

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,000
vermont maple syrup but you got to know

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,640
somebody get homemade thick desserts

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,239
okay this is slow food but it's also

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,920
slow gardening because we're enjoying

37
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,519
being and we will have something sweet

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,200
in the middle by the way i brought a

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,719
case of this and a friend of mine over

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,560
in pennsylvania swapped me out some

41
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:41,438
strawberry rhubarb preserve

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,040
is this is he playing a joke on me

43
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,039
i mean it's not going to hurt to eat it

44
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,158
so that's what slow guarding is if you

45
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,839
want a real quick run down i've got a

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,079
list of a few things that you can do

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,920
that you already do these things but you

48
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,599
don't think about them okay you don't

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,600
think about sharing with others you

50
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,919
don't think about talking with children

51
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,919
about gardening there's some fantastic

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,920
children's gardens all over the new

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,759
england all over the country

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,159
but all you have to do is bend down and

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,719
wiggle your finger in the grass and talk

56
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,280
about whatever you find with a child if

57
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,199
you're lucky it'll be a roly-poly okay

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
but if you just talk with a child for a

59
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,519
little while and engage them you can

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,319
change that child's attitude about not

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,319
only the world but maybe about grown-ups

62
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,759
okay so that's what slow gardening is go

63
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,958
to my website

64
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,959
i'll tell you what it is just to say

65
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,878
again it's non-commercial i don't keep

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,519
track who goes there click on the thing

67
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,959
called slow gardening okay and see if

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
it's not things that you already do that

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,360
maybe just haven't focused on and that's

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,120
my job here today just relax a little

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,680
bit i want to throw out one last thing

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,319
before we go uh this this bottle tree

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,640
anybody have a bottle tree

74
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,479
okay you got a bottle tree

75
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,238
a lot of people don't get it okay it's

76
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,878
where you take an old tree that died in

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,439
the stick bottles on the branches okay

78
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,280
um who's been a sissinghurst

79
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,560
okay you know when you go up the tower

80
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,560
about halfway up they got that window

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,759
with all the glass in it in the

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,360
wintertime

83
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,199
particularly people up north have

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,239
colorful glass bottles in your window

85
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,759
you know what i'm talking about don't

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,439
you and the reason you do that is

87
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,039
because in the wintertime your pineal

88
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,840
gland that thing that affects your

89
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,560
attitude shrinks up okay you get what

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,759
they call seasonal affective disorder

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,280
the blues

92
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,439
you put a little chlorophyll glass in

93
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,598
the window and it stimulates you a

94
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,359
little bit it sparks you up okay well

95
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,280
bottle trees are just taking it out of

96
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,040
the yard

97
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,000
by the way some people don't like bottle

98
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,519
trees

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,039
my way of thinking if you think it's

100
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,959
okay to hang stuff out of holes in your

101
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:43,840
ears you just shut up about my balls

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,920
but you're fine now

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,640
local artists do this and it's supposed

104
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:52,479
to be swirly throwing organic and swirly

105
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:55,518
it's an artistic thing and uh these car

106
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:58,479
what do you have we call them car tags

107
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,480
license plates

108
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,480
head me out here all right say madison

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,400
county on the side i'm not from madison

110
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,798
county madison i'm in a little artsy

111
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,200
party community in madison county is the

112
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,519
gated community counties and i do this

113
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,199
with all madison county because it honks

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,560

115
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,079
when i say honk them off you know what

116
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,759
i'm talking about

117
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,358
see so i'm being even a little

118
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,280
expressive in a mean way with this kind

119
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,000
of people when i'm driving down the road

120
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,879
