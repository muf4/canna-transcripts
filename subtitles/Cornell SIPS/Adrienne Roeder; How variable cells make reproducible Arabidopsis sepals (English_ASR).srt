00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,770
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,769
University

3
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,699
thank you Bill for that very kind

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,570
introduction

5
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:22,528
it's the microphone on and can you can

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,420
you hear me okay okay great so it's a

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:27,268
real pleasure to be here today to tell

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,550
you about the last five years of work in

9
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:31,259
my lab now there's no way I can tell you

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,689
about all the last five years of work in

11
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:35,189
my lab we'd be here all afternoon so I'm

12
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:37,979
going to focus on a couple of stories

13
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:40,170
and one of the real themes emerging from

14
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,929
the research in my lab is the importance

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,250
of variability in plant development and

16
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:46,859
I'm going to tell you two stories about

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,570
variability today and variability is

18
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:49,890
something we don't often think about as

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,810
biologists it's something we kind of

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,789
sweep under the rug we do our

21
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,859
experiments we get a number of

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,420
replicates we take the average we put

23
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,840
the error bars on we hope the error bars

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,820
are small and that's about it but I the

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,500
theme emerging from my labs research is

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,118
that the variability is actually really

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:13,460
important and we need to pay attention

28
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:13,459
to it so one of the fundamental

29
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:20,240
maybe we should yeah is that okay with

30
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:27,100
everyone there is it should we try this

31
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:30,519
one you know this one there we go okay

32
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:32,689
one of the fundamental question

33
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:35,658
characteristics of all organisms is

34
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:38,569
their size from the giant sequoia tree

35
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:41,450
to the small flowering plant wolf eeeh

36
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:43,699
or the mouse to the elephant and the

37
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,320
organ size needs to follow the organism

38
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,118
so a mouse has a very small liver

39
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,779
whereas an elephant has a very large

40
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:53,509
liver a couple years ago in science

41
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,219
magazine the question of how two organs

42
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:58,429
know when they've reached the right size

43
00:01:55,219 --> 00:02:00,079
and decide to stop growing is one of the

44
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:05,060
fundamental mysteries in developmental

45
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:07,129
biology and fundamentally organ size is

46
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,719
really simple it's controlled by the

47
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:11,479
number and size of the cells in the

48
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,039
organ and so in theory if you just

49
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,439
increase the cell number you'll get a

50
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,169
bigger organ or if you crease the cell

51
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,969
size you'll get a bigger organ now as

52
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:22,429
probably most of you know reality is

53
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:24,879
nowhere near this simple and we'll come

54
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,879
back to that

55
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:31,908
closely related species often have

56
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:33,559
different sizes here's a rabid OPS's

57
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:35,688
belly on a flower and here's a rabbit

58
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,090
OPS's la rata flower you can see that

59
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:40,090
they have the same organs in the flower

60
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,829
on a petal is much smaller than the arab

61
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,688
adopts esperado petal and it's been said

62
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:49,609
that size is the material that evolution

63
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:51,408
largely works on but the fields really

64
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:53,450
in the dark about how this happens we

65
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:55,519
don't know the mechanisms of how size

66
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:57,229
changes but since it's worked on by

67
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,870
evolution it means that there has to be

68
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:02,858
some genetic control which gives us a

69
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,859
handle to get in here

70
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:08,179
within a single species size is very

71
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:09,949
consistent so these are our rabbit ops

72
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,379
italiana petals and you can see they're

73
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:13,908
all the same size and shape and so when

74
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:15,888
we're thinking about plants but think

75
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:20,989
about organs like floral organs as

76
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:23,419
petals sepals stamens carpals so one of

77
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:26,090
the fundamental questions is how two

78
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:28,189
organs form with a reproducible size and

79
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,109
shape and this is a very broad question

80
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:30,799
it applies to us humans and it applies

81
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,290
to plants

82
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,909
so as humans you can think about your

83
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:37,489
two arms your two your arms are the same

84
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:40,939
length with a precision of point zero

85
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:42,680
two and if you think about when you're

86
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,658
developing when your smile small child

87
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,489
your arms are also the same length and

88
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:48,378
then as you become an adult they grow

89
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,810
and throughout that period they would

90
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:53,598
maintain the same length the same thing

91
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,549
is true in plants in sepals so the sepal

92
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,280
is the outermost green leaf light floral

93
00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:01,129
organ and the first thing the sepal does

94
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,568
is grow and protect the floral meristem

95
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:06,138
and then developing reproductives and

96
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:08,238
organs inside the flower and there are

97
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:10,250
four sepals on each or Abid OPS's flower

98
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,549
and those four sequels have to be the

99
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,389
same size to enclose the flower and

100
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,060
protect the bud

101
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:20,159
and it's the same with humans they start

102
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,019
out very small and they have to maintain

103
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,450
the same size throughout their growth as

104
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,069
the flower is developing from the young

105
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:29,789
sepals here in the middle to be older

106
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:32,339
sepals out here to maintain this closure

107
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,810
and protection here's 4 sepals from a

108
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:39,060
flower you can see they're really very

109
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:40,860
similar size and shape what makes the

110
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,589
reproducibility of Oregon's size

111
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,110
particularly mysterious is the finding

112
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:48,599
in many organisms that cells are highly

113
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,569
variable and if we take sepals as an

114
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,790
example sepals have highly variable cell

115
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:55,769
size they've got this beautiful pattern

116
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,960
of giant cells which are false colored

117
00:04:55,769 --> 00:05:00,419
here in red interspersed between a whole

118
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:04,319
range of smaller cell sizes so there's a

119
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,689
ton of variability in cell size there's

120
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,939
also a ton of variability growth rates

121
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:11,639
so here I'm showing you a heat map of a

122
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:12,990
young developing seat bowl and I'm gonna

123
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,959
show you a bunch of heat maps throughout

124
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,389
the talk in this case red is growing

125
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,889
fast and blue is growing slow so you can

126
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,329
see there's a ton of variability in

127
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,039
these cells and their growth rates

128
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,329
you've got cells that are growing fast

129
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,680
right next to cells that are growing

130
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:31,469
very slowly and if we think about plant

131
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,090
cells their growth is regulated by the

132
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,550
cell wall mechanics and the turgor

133
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:37,139
pressure inside so we also have looked

134
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,360
at cell wall mechanics and find that

135
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,069
they're highly variable as well so in

136
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,650
collaboration with a rescue balloon and

137
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:45,899
the till Du Monde we did atomic force

138
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:48,060
microscopy to look at the cell wall

139
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,609
mechanics called properties so here's

140
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,819
another heat map in this case red is

141
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:56,139
stiff and blue is soft and we've traced

142
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:58,089
the outlines of the cells here in black

143
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:01,149
over the afm data you can see that we've

144
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:02,649
got soft stiff patches right next to

145
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:04,569
soft patches so there's a ton of

146
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:07,060
variability in the cell wall properties

147
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:08,920
as well so at the cellular level and

148
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,189
even sub cellular level we see a ton of

149
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,439
variability how do we go from this

150
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:18,129
cellular variability to get regular

151
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:19,779
organs and the rabbit off the steeple is

152
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:22,629
a particularly good model system for

153
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,039
looking at this question particularly

154
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:26,649
because it's relatively invariant to

155
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,480
environmental fluctuations now in the

156
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:31,089
future of course we want to understand

157
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,680
how the environment actually regulates

158
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,209
growth but to start we need to

159
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,699
understand growth to begin with without

160
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:38,319
the input of the environment so floral

161
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,649
organs are relatively invariant to the

162
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,300
environment the flower is also

163
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:45,429
particularly good because it has four

164
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,920
sepals and that allows us to compare

165
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,490
organize within a single flower in

166
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,560
addition there's sixty to a hundred seat

167
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,110
flowers per plant so we can really get a

168
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:01,180
statistical analysis of sepal size

169
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:02,949
within a single plant and finally it's

170
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,100
accessible for live imaging and

171
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,779
manipulation and one of the experiments

172
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,500
that we love to do in my lab is live

173
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:13,119
imaging so we take our living plant

174
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,829
attach it to a slide stuff it under the

175
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,019
confocal microscope and take an image

176
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:19,839
and then we put it back in the growth

177
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:21,939
chamber let it grow for another 6 8 12

178
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,439
hours depending on the experiment and

179
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:26,560
then it put it back on the microscope

180
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,269
and image the same sepal again and

181
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,490
here's just an example of a few cells

182
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:32,019
we've got the nuclei marked in gold and

183
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,990
the plasma memories are really faint and

184
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:37,299
they're also in gold you can see there's

185
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,639
three cells here than six hours later

186
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,280
this cell has divided to make two cells

187
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,318
here this cell has divided to make these

188
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,848
two cells

189
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,039
and this cell has just grown so we can

190
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:51,058
track what's going on in each of the

191
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:53,038
cells over time so here's an example of

192
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:54,689
that live imaging you can see the sepals

193
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,498
growing tremendously the nuclei are

194
00:07:54,689 --> 00:08:01,919
moving around some cells are dividing

195
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:04,710
and in collaboration with Gerardo Terry

196
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:08,938
yellow then picked up tsukumo Zachos we

197
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:10,918
developed a method for tracking the cell

198
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:14,129
lineages so tracking each cell in all of

199
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:16,528
its descendants we've colored each cell

200
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:19,139
in its descendants by the same color and

201
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:21,749
you can see here that this giant cell

202
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,418
that formed never went and under what

203
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:26,849
any divisions is all one cell and this

204
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:30,718
purple patch here went through a lot of

205
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:32,729
divisions so there's many cells we

206
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:34,439
incorporated this into the Morpho

207
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,209
graphic software package that richard

208
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,120
smith developed and this has been

209
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:42,379
published in Elife as part of the more

210
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,379
for graphic software package

211
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,440
so the main question is how to sell

212
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,179
their variability give rise to organ

213
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,440
regularity and there's two sides of this

214
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:53,039
question that I'm gonna look at today

215
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,680
the first is what mechanisms generate

216
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,629
the cellular variability and this is the

217
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,370
work of my graduate student

218
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:02,159
Heather Meyer who just defended her PhD

219
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,320
and the second question is how do

220
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,509
variable cells produce uniform organs

221
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,120
and this is the work of my postdoc dr.

222
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:10,710
Leland home okay so let's start with

223
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,139
this first question how do we get this

224
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,150
cell variability and we want to look at

225
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,490
this as a typical patterning question

226
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:20,340
and ask particularly about giant cells

227
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,159
how do we get the pattern of giant cells

228
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,180
interspersed between small cells and so

229
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,620
if we think about this in a

230
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,509
developmental patterning setting would

231
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,279
think about we've got a small immature

232
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:31,769
sepal primordium where the cells are all

233
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,990
uniform they're all the same and how

234
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:36,389
does a single cell decide it's going to

235
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:39,779
divide to become a giant cell or it's

236
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:41,610
going to become a small cell so everyone

237
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,620
always asked me what's the purpose of

238
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,960
giant cells they have an effect on

239
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,940
Oregon curvature so in a wild-type

240
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,550
sequel we've got interspersed giant

241
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,970
cells and the sepals straighten up when

242
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:56,039
the flower blooms and protect the base

243
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:59,190
if we have plants with too many giant

244
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,839
cells then the sepals splay outward and

245
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,090
they open up too early so that

246
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,560
developing flower bud is not protected

247
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,670
and it's not protecting the base here

248
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:10,319
either if we have sepals with no giant

249
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:12,629
cells they have a very subtle inward

250
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,940
curvature defect they're curved too much

251
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:16,889
inward they're not straightening up as

252
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,640
the flower blooms to sit nicely along

253
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:20,409
the base of the flower

254
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,809
and if we have a double mutant that

255
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:24,100
loses giant cells then spasibo start to

256
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:26,199
roll up on themselves

257
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,940
you see it's completely rolling up and

258
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,610
because of this it's not protecting the

259
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,180
flower very well either so giant cells

260
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:36,129
have a role in sepal curvature we've

261
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:37,929
previously shown that giant cells formed

262
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:40,778
through a specialized cell cycle called

263
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:43,689
end or duplication during the normal

264
00:10:40,778 --> 00:10:46,929
cell cycle cells grow in g1 replicate

265
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,760
their DNA and S phase grow in g2 and

266
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:50,679
then divided an M phase and keep on

267
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:52,328
going through the cell cycle during

268
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:55,179
endure duplication cells exit the

269
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:57,159
mitotic cell cycle and grow replicate

270
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:58,778
their DNA and grow and keep on growing

271
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,600
and replicating their DNA becoming

272
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:05,409
enlarged and polyploid so that's how you

273
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,720
get these big giant cells if we measure

274
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:09,549
DNA content using flow cytometry to

275
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,579
measure how many endo cycles is

276
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:14,109
undergone we can see we have to see

277
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:17,409
diploid cells that's the starting point

278
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:20,829
they replicate their DNA once a 4c twice

279
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:24,159
to 83 times the 16 seat or four times to

280
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:27,698
32 seat this is these 16 C and 32 C

281
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:29,919
cells that are the giant cells and if we

282
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:33,519
look at the relationship between DNA

283
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,039
content and cells area or we find that

284
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,080
it's linearly correlated so the giant

285
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:41,179
cells are the 16 C cells

286
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,690
and from our previous live imaging data

287
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:46,909
we've seen how these giant cells form so

288
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,220
if we take two and I'm going to show you

289
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:51,110
a very simplified model here if we take

290
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,980
to see diploid cells in our cito

291
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:58,399
primordium they replicate their DNA to

292
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,050
4c during the cell cycle if these two

293
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,909
divide they go back to being two seed

294
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:05,419
diploid cells whereas if this one Endora

295
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:07,519
duplicates it becomes a 4c cell now once

296
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:09,649
a cell under a duplicate it generally

297
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,299
cannot go back and divide again so it's

298
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:14,360
going to enter a duplicate again

299
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:17,209
so this 4c cell under duple gets to be

300
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,919
an 8c cell this cell maybe decides to

301
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,600
enter a duplicate and become a 4c cell

302
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:24,469
and the rest of cells might decide to

303
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,330
divide in the next cell cycle this 8c

304
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,820
cell is going to become a 16 C giant

305
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,280
cell this 4c cell is going to become an

306
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,840
8c cell maybe the cell under duplicates

307
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,240
to become a 4c selling the rest of mine

308
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,700
so what you can see here is that the

309
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,649
pattern of cell sizes develops just

310
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,810
based on the time at which each cell

311
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:43,759
decides to end or duplicate if it end

312
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:45,529
decides to end or duplicate very early

313
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,990
it becomes very enlarged and becomes a

314
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:52,459
giant cell if it end or duplicate slate

315
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,960
it does not okay so we've got one answer

316
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,330
to our question how do we get this

317
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,240
variability it's by variability in the

318
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,680
timing of end or duplication but it

319
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,710
still leaves us with another question

320
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:05,509
how does an individual cell decide

321
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,670
whether it's going to divide and become

322
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:11,210
small or under a duplicate and become

323
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:13,669
large so to start to get out this

324
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,990
question when I was a postdoc I started

325
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,059
a mutant screen and we finished this

326
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,129
mutant screen in my lab looking for

327
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:21,319
mutants that effect giant cell formation

328
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:23,750
and we pulled out quite a number of

329
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,910
mutants one is a cell cycle regulator

330
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,240
that will come back to there's a number

331
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:29,818
of mutants in the

332
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,669
Thermal specification pathway this was

333
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:34,678
quite a surprise and there was one

334
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:36,509
mutant with ectopic giant cells it's

335
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:39,299
involved in sub cellular trafficking and

336
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:40,860
this was the work of my first graduate

337
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:45,299
student Sheehan and he published it a

338
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:47,699
nice plant physiology paper on that but

339
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:50,099
today I want to focus on the AML one

340
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:55,318
gene in 1801 unit you can see the HTML 1

341
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:57,869
mutant completely lacks giant cells ATM

342
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:59,729
l1 encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper

343
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:02,550
transcription factor and it's involved

344
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,139
in epidermal specification so here's the

345
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:06,479
protein structure you've got a homeo

346
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:10,649
domain a leucine zipper domain and a

347
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,808
start domain atmo one is expressed

348
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:14,818
throughout the epidermis including in

349
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:16,588
young sepals so here's here's a young

350
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:21,299
seat bow you can see it's expressed in

351
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:22,949
all that outer layer of cells 80 ml one

352
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:24,628
is well known for its role in epidermal

353
00:14:22,948 --> 00:14:27,240
specification based on the work of avi

354
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:30,928
at all who found that atmo mutations in

355
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:34,198
1801 and its sister gene PDF to cause a

356
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:35,730
loss of epidermal identity so in

357
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:37,618
wild-type or got a scanning electron

358
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,139
micrograph and we're looking down on the

359
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:41,730
surface you can see here's the epidermis

360
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,399
and it's been peeled back to reveal the

361
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,889
musa phil cells underneath and the HTML

362
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,480
one PDF - double mutant and poor plant

363
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:50,759
has its music phil expose there's no

364
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,899
epidermis overlying it if it's amazing

365
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,789
is that those plants will actually

366
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:56,159
germinate on soil but then they

367
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:58,669
desiccating croak it's pretty bad not to

368
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:02,659
have an epidermis

369
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:05,519
conversely if you overexpress atmo one

370
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:07,370
throughout all the cell layers then you

371
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,139
start to get epidermal cell types

372
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,659
forming in the internal layers here's a

373
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,949
wild-type cotyledon and you can see

374
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:16,259
here's the epidermis and in the

375
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,540
epidermis there these stomata which are

376
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:21,149
staying dark blue which allow for gas

377
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:22,679
exchange when a Samoans over expressed

378
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:25,199
in all cell layers you start to get

379
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:28,199
stomata developing in the internal musa

380
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,560
phil cells that's really toxic to the

381
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:36,870
plant and these guys die too so dead or

382
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:41,069
dead but the question we have is since

383
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:44,940
1800 one is expressed in every cell in

384
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:47,490
the sepal epidermis how is it that only

385
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:50,880
specifies some of them to become giant

386
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:52,230
cells and so we know from the HTML one

387
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,429
signal meaning that still has an

388
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,830
epidermis and yet it's completely

389
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:59,339
lacking these giant cells this is a

390
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:01,170
question that fascinated Heather and so

391
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,450
what we have to ask is what happens if

392
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,459
we overexpress atmo one just in the

393
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,629
epidermis so we're not over expressing

394
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,780
it in the inner cell layers we're not

395
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:11,730
talking lethality here now we get this

396
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,199
spectacular phenotype anthias is in

397
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,480
collaboration with Rita San bento and

398
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,270
Gwyneth Ingram these peoples are

399
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,639
completely covered in giant cells so

400
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:22,590
just over expressing atmo one in the

401
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,529
epidermis just increasing the levels is

402
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:29,100
sufficient to make sepals with all giant

403
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:31,829
cells and that tells us that levels of

404
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,409
80ml 1 are really important in this

405
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,780
patterning process

406
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:38,610
so Heather explored this further and

407
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:41,789
asked the question how do different

408
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,980
genetic levels of atmo one influence the

409
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:46,709
number of giant cells so just showing

410
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,120
you that HMO and overexpression make

411
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,540
steeples with all giant cells if we

412
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:55,440
reduce the level of atmo 1 by making the

413
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:57,779
transgene heterozygous we find still a

414
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,690
lot of giant cells but now a few cells

415
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:03,209
escape and become small cells so

416
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,769
reducing atmo 1 reduces the number of

417
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,920
jetan cells we can take this a step

418
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:10,170
further by removing the endogenous atmo

419
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,470
1 by crossing this into the mutant and

420
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,240
we can see that in that case we still

421
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:19,019
have ectopic giant cells but even fewer

422
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,818
of them and finally the final test is if

423
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:23,309
we look at a heterozygous mutant that

424
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:26,279
should have less 80ml 1 than wild-type

425
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:28,470
we should get fewer giant cells and

426
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:31,039
that's exactly what we see so there's a

427
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:34,430
beautiful dosage dependency of the

428
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:39,420
number of giant cells on the genetic

429
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:41,430
level of atmo 1 ok so we wanted to

430
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,560
verify this not just with imaging but

431
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,360
with another mechanism so Heather did

432
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,039
flow cytometry to look at the end or

433
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,929
duplication remember giant cells are

434
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,609
highly and/or duplicated so we're only

435
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:54,150
looking at the highly end or duplicated

436
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:56,519
cells and we see a very nice radiation

437
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,580
in the number of 16c giant cells on

438
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:01,410
these lines so the overexpression

439
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:03,679
homozygous has a lot and it goes down to

440
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,240
the mutant which has very very few

441
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,250
what's even more remarkable is that the

442
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,829
overexpression line actually increases

443
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:13,109
end or duplication we start to see 64c

444
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:13,980
cells with an extra in disciple that we

445
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:19,289
don't see in

446
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:21,870
type so clearly the dosage of 80 ml one

447
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:25,048
is really important for controlling the

448
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:27,750
number of giant cells in the sepal but

449
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:29,339
this raises a question the wild type

450
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,349
where we've got some cells becoming

451
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:33,240
giant and some cells not becoming giant

452
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:35,069
they all have the same dosage of 80 ml

453
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,349
one this is wild type plants they've got

454
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:39,089
two copies of bacon with one gene so

455
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:42,058
there's a couple of possibilities here

456
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:43,619
either the cells exhibit varying

457
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:46,079
responses to the same 80 ml one

458
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:48,989
concentration or 80 ml one

459
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,759
concentrations vary between cells now to

460
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,910
test these two possibilities Heather

461
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:56,009
generated an 80 ml 1 fluorescent fusion

462
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,590
protein reporter so she's got the whole

463
00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:01,079
upstream promoter region she's got the

464
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:04,048
MCG fluorescent protein fused to 80 ml 1

465
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:06,839
and the downstream 3 prime UTR region

466
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:10,259
and she transformed this into 80 ml one

467
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:13,740
mutant plant and selected lines where it

468
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:16,019
rescues the wild-type number of giant

469
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,240
cells this is really important because

470
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:20,099
this tells us that this trans gene is

471
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,630
functional so the atmo one here is the

472
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:23,730
only atmo one it's making the giant

473
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:26,309
sauce and it also tells us that this

474
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:30,298
atmo one is expressed at the right level

475
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:32,759
so what we see is going to accurately

476
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:34,720
reflect producing the wild-type number

477
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,230
of giant cells

478
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,000
okay so what what do we see in this line

479
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:43,120
well we see that different cells have

480
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,430
different concentrations of atmo one so

481
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:48,789
here's here's the atmo one fluorescent

482
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:50,410
for fusion protein reporter and it's

483
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,730
little nuclear localized because there's

484
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,590
a transcription factor so what you're

485
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,930
seeing here all these dots are different

486
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:58,359
nuclei and you can see that some have

487
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:00,670
very high concentrations of atmo and

488
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:02,679
very bright and its neighbor is a little

489
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,269
bit lower over here there's a really

490
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,200
bright one here's one that's so dim you

491
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,329
can barely see it

492
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,370
so there's definitely different

493
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:11,889
concentrations of atmo one in these

494
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:14,139
different epidermal cells and this is a

495
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:15,910
point at which giant cells this is

496
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,220
before giant cells have been established

497
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:23,200
this is before before the specification

498
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:25,120
has taken place so how does one cell get

499
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,059
a higher level of HTML one expression

500
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,759
than its neighbor and this made us think

501
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:33,099
about the fact that gene expression is

502
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,440
stochastic there's been a lot of studies

503
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:38,799
showing that gene expression fluctuates

504
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,470
up and down so we hypothesize that maybe

505
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,079
8:01 concentrations fluctuate in each

506
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,250
cell randomly and maybe this is the

507
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,649
patterning mechanism

508
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,259
so if atmo one is fluctuating up and

509
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,180
down if it passes a threshold meaning

510
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:54,460
that cell goes on to become a giant cell

511
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,350
whereas another cell that never crosses

512
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,860
that threshold goes on to become a small

513
00:20:56,349 --> 00:21:01,719
cell this fits with our genetic data so

514
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,829
if we increase the expression of a team

515
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,960
on one we're going to bump all this

516
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:06,730
fluctuation up above the threshold and

517
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,120
now everything's going to become a giant

518
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,120
cell

519
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:13,799
in the HTML one mutant now everything's

520
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,059
below the threshold and nothing's going

521
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,269
to become a giant cell cuz there's no

522
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:21,210
80ml one okay so now we need to test

523
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:22,980
this by live imaging so how their live

524
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:28,710
image these HTML one reporters every

525
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:30,690
eight hours and here's the here's the

526
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:34,019
movie showing you the development over

527
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:37,340
eight hours over well every eight hours

528
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:39,750
over many hours and we collaborated with

529
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:41,759
Henrik Johnson James Locke and their

530
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,680
postdocs josée tell us and POW for most

531
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,289
of Jordan at the Sainsbury laboratory at

532
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,779
University of Cambridge to quantify atmo

533
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:53,089
one in each cell over time and to create

534
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:56,039
a model so Heather actually flew over to

535
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:58,230
Cambridge and worked with josée on

536
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,240
developing a quantification pipeline and

537
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,599
this is a real tour de force so they

538
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,289
take the raw image they segment every

539
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:10,709
single nucleus which means detect each

540
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:13,470
one individually they take different

541
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:16,259
time points and align them using alt and

542
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:19,470
then can track the cell lineages over

543
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:21,180
time so we've got the sixteen hour time

544
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,220
point in red in the 24 hour time point

545
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,470
and green and if it's the nucleus is

546
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,450
yellow that means that it's the same

547
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,579
nucleus and if it's divided then they

548
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:33,610
track which one's descended from which

549
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:37,659
and measure the 80 ml one concentration

550
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:39,129
in the nucleus and then put all this

551
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,810
data together so that we can track

552
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,090
individual nuclei how their HMO one

553
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:46,329
concentration fluctuates and this is

554
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:48,789
just a hit it does fluctuate okay so we

555
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:51,369
have two predictions to be tested from

556
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:53,349
the model the first is that before cell

557
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:56,139
becomes giant HMO one level should be

558
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:58,269
above the threshold and the second is

559
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,130
that if a cell is going to remain small

560
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:02,170
that atmo one level should not surpass

561
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,300
the threshold and the key here is that

562
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:08,500
this should all happen before the fate

563
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:10,539
is decided so that it's predictive okay

564
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,569
so here's what we see we've got all the

565
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:16,899
cells in the sepal epidermis giant cells

566
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:18,309
are in red small cells are blue you can

567
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,160
see first of all but it does fluctuate

568
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:24,099
that's very dramatic

569
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,290
the second the hypothesis is less clear

570
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:28,539
though you can see that in general the

571
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:29,920
giant cells tend to reach high levels of

572
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:32,740
a tumor one so here's HMO low

573
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,840
concentration high levels over time but

574
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,880
some of the blue cells actually reach

575
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:38,470
very very high concentration so some

576
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,510
small cells are getting way up here in

577
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,250
the concentration so then how they're

578
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:44,529
thought about this a little bit more and

579
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,839
asked is there any cell cycle dependence

580
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:49,720
because n reduplication decision is

581
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:51,579
probably made during g2 and so she

582
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,640
determined the cell cycle by looking at

583
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:57,099
the nuclear area so in this is a cell

584
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,560
that goes through g2 its large it

585
00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:01,509
divides g1 nuclei are smaller here's the

586
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:04,539
graph showing a nuclear area over time

587
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:07,750
it's large in G two divides two smaller

588
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:09,519
nuclei so you can use the nuclear area

589
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,509
to determine the stage of the cell cycle

590
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:16,039
and throughout I'm going to show you

591
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:18,379
jeetu in light blue and g1 in yellow so

592
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,839
let's take a look at a couple cells here

593
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,090
we've got a cell that starts out in g1

594
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:25,549
it goes through g2 it's got a very high

595
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:26,809
concentration of HTML 1 and G 2 and then

596
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:29,839
it goes on Android duplicates and

597
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:33,319
becomes a giant cell so we plot this on

598
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:35,539
the graph and we drive a threshold for

599
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:37,519
HTML 1 you can see that this cell

600
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:38,920
crosses the threshold and then becomes a

601
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,609
giant cell

602
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,080
now here's another cell but has lower

603
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:46,549
concentrations of HTML wondering g2 it

604
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:50,599
never quite makes it past the threshold

605
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:52,149
and it divides and goes on to become too

606
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:54,500
small cells

607
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,750
here's another cell that is above the

608
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,849
threshold in g1 but it's also above the

609
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,940
threshold in g2 and it goes on to enter

610
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:03,889
a duplicate where's this cell crosses

611
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,960
the threshold in g1 but that doesn't

612
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:08,180
have any effect in g2 it's below the

613
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,740
threshold and it goes on and divides so

614
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:14,690
we're seeing a clear cell cycle

615
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:16,460
dependence if the cells in g2 and the

616
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:20,559
HTML one crosses the threshold then it

617
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:23,059
becomes a giant cell so we wanted to

618
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,529
quantify this using receiver operator

619
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:26,809
characteristic and find the threshold

620
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:29,809
this way so if we look at all the cell's

621
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:32,419
in g1 and we take the peak a t-mobile

622
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:34,819
and concentration before it makes a

623
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:38,060
decision so the top one we can plot it

624
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:41,569
here and you see we've got fairly

625
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:44,210
overlapping distributions here and if we

626
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:46,519
do look at the true positives versus the

627
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:50,509
false positives it basically follows the

628
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:52,879
random line and we get a 54%

629
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:54,710
productivity which basically means we

630
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,789
have no productivity here so not

631
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,558
predictive in g1

632
00:25:55,788 --> 00:26:00,288
whereas if we look at g2 phase so we've

633
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,028
got again the peak 18:01

634
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:04,740
you can see that now this distributes

635
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:06,898
better the giant cells tend to have a

636
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,058
higher peak 18001 than the small cells

637
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:12,058
if we plot true positives versus false

638
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:15,538
positives then we get 82% productivity

639
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:17,970
and so this one is predictive so g2

640
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:22,648
phase HMO concentration in g2 phase is

641
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:24,929
predictive okay so in summary we've got

642
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:27,898
the HMO one concentration in g1 phase

643
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:29,580
doesn't tell us anything but in g2 phase

644
00:26:27,898 --> 00:26:31,288
if HMO one is low it's going to go

645
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:33,119
through mitosis and divide whereas if

646
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:35,669
it's high it's going to go on and end or

647
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,109
duplicate and become a giant cell so we

648
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:40,980
put this into a model this is developed

649
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:42,658
by Pao Formosa Jordan so 80 ml one in

650
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,519
every single cell we've got 80 ml one

651
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:47,159
it's got a concentration that changes in

652
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:50,038
time based on production there's a

653
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,350
production term degradation degradation

654
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:55,109
term and a positive feedback loop that

655
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:57,569
we hypothesize because HTML one has its

656
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:59,428
own binding site in its promoter and it

657
00:26:57,569 --> 00:27:00,778
turns out in the model we it can work

658
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:02,519
whether we have or do not have this

659
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:05,250
positive feedback loop so it's actually

660
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:07,648
not necessary and then we put stochastic

661
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:11,700
noise into every single part of this

662
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:17,489
equation so everything is a little bit

663
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:19,380
random and so then we think that atmo

664
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,700
one must control some downstream target

665
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,830
gene given that it's a transcription

666
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,048
factor so we act activating something

667
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:27,710
and that downstream target gene is going

668
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:31,139
to regulate the cell cycle only in g2

669
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:33,750
phase to promote end or duplication and

670
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,909
inhibit mitosis so we've got this cell

671
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,079
cycle timer here and it's just

672
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:40,260
oscillating up and down to give us a

673
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,490
cell cycle time but the behavior of HTML

674
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:43,230
one versus a target is really

675
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,778
interesting because it produces a soft

676
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:49,230
threshold so the target has to cross a

677
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:51,480
threshold during g2 to make a cell under

678
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,130
duplicate and become giant it generally

679
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,470
follows atmo one but there's a lot of

680
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,600
stochasticity here so sometimes HTML one

681
00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:00,298
will cross so we've got HTML one

682
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,189
concentration target if HTML one crosses

683
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:05,369
its threshold but the target does not

684
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,929
then the cell is going to divide whereas

685
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:09,000
if the target crushes the threshold but

686
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:10,320
HTML 1 does not then the cell is going

687
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,089
to end or duplicate so that might

688
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:15,480
explain this 82 percent productivity

689
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:18,388
we've got we've got soft threshold here

690
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,278
okay so how does the model look well it

691
00:28:18,388 --> 00:28:23,609
looks very much like the data so we've

692
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:26,220
got 800 one concentrations fluctuating

693
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:28,229
up and down if they surpass a threshold

694
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,139
in g2 then this all goes on under

695
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:33,839
reduplication

696
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:35,638
the cell does not pass the threshold in

697
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,629
g2 it's going to keep dividing and

698
00:28:35,638 --> 00:28:38,069
dividing and even if

699
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,790
passes the threshold of g1 it keeps

700
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:43,919
dividing here's the model we've got a

701
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:45,539
team on fluctuating up and down we've

702
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,460
got the target fluctuating up and down

703
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:49,139
following a team l1 we've got the timer

704
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,360
that's just doing the soft cycle and

705
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:54,840
here we've got these cell size pattern

706
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:58,859
developing so we've got the ploidy so

707
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:00,359
again the 2c is in yellow 4c is in blue

708
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:03,659
and if it Endor duplicates it becomes

709
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:06,719
red and then purple than green so let's

710
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:09,690
play that movie again and you can watch

711
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,700
the ploidy and see that the cells are

712
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,529
going to 4c then they're dividing going

713
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,880
back to 2c but then sometimes they

714
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:16,559
decide to end or duplicate and become

715
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,530
red and then those cells and to renew

716
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,960
placate further and become giant cells

717
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:23,789
so we the model is developing a pattern

718
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,900
of giant cells interspersed between

719
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:30,750
smaller cells so can the model reproduce

720
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,640
our beautiful dosage series yes it can

721
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,200
if we just varied the HTML one

722
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,570
production rate we can get the whole

723
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,809
range of different numbers of giant

724
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:41,129
cells from all giant cells down to you

725
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:45,079
know a few giant cells like wild-type

726
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:45,080
down to no giant cells in the mutant

727
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:49,950
so in conclusion we've really discovered

728
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:52,159
a new patterning mechanism based on

729
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,779
fluctuations of a transcription factor

730
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:59,009
atmo one fluctuates up and down in the

731
00:29:54,779 --> 00:30:01,230
sepal primordium cells and in the hi

732
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:02,940
stage during g2 it promotes end

733
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,740
replication and causes the formation of

734
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,600
a giant cell whereas if it's low

735
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,960
throughout g2 then the cell divides and

736
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,849
becomes a small cell and this is really

737
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,559
fascinating because modeling has long

738
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:18,389
predicted that there should be slight

739
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:22,169
fluctuations of the activators of cell

740
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:24,060
fate to promote patterning even if it's

741
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,860
a regular pattern they need to be

742
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:28,079
initiated by very small differences

743
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:30,089
between cells so here's a model based on

744
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,970
the formation of trichomes or hair cells

745
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:34,709
and you've got the activators very

746
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,960
slightly fluctuating randomly and that

747
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:41,370
sets up the regular pattern of trichome

748
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,019
spacing so we are now seeing very much

749
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:46,229
amplified fluctuations that are doing

750
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:48,059
the patterning so this is the work of

751
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,220
Heather as I said and she just defended

752
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:53,190
her PhD and the papers in revision for

753
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,809
Elife and of course this is not the end

754
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:57,900
of the story we have a lot of future

755
00:30:54,809 --> 00:31:00,950
questions which are what gene says atmo

756
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:03,360
one regulate to produce giant cells and

757
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,190
how do these genes respond to different

758
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,439
concentrations of 18:01 to enact a

759
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,600
threshold and what about the other

760
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,309
epidermal specification genes we found

761
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,929
involved in giant cell development are

762
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:15,869
the upstream downstream or enough

763
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:17,400
possibly in a feedback loop and Lila

764
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:19,619
Luna just joined the lab and she's

765
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,990
working on these questions and this is

766
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:23,219
work funded by a five year NSF career

767
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:26,009
grant

768
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,240
and then we're also looking at Lego and

769
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,160
I mentioned Lego in the very beginning

770
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,769
as one of the other mutants it doesn't

771
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,500
have any giant cells Lego encodes a cell

772
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:37,109
cycle regulator that's involved in

773
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,779
hitting cyclin-cdk complexes and it

774
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:41,339
promotes end or duplication so the

775
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:43,589
question is does Lego follow the

776
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:45,480
predictions in the model for the target

777
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:47,879
and Dana is working on this one

778
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,410
prediction is that Lego should be dosage

779
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,620
dependent like atmo one and that's

780
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:55,470
exactly what dana sees so you can get

781
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:58,139
big radiation from all giant cells so no

782
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:03,809
giant cells by modulating the genetic

783
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:05,310
dosage of Lego okay so we need to come

784
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:07,589
back to the question of Oregon's size

785
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:09,389
here and ask how to cell size affect

786
00:32:07,589 --> 00:32:13,529
organ size this was our original

787
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:15,600
hypothesis but as you can see the number

788
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:18,029
of giant cells has absolutely no effect

789
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,699
on organ size whatsoever so you can go

790
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:23,220
from very few very large cells to many

791
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,380
small cells and the sepal so here's

792
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:28,529
sepal area and here's the different

793
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:31,560
genotypes they're all basically exactly

794
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:33,750
the same this is the work of Dana

795
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,220
so this brings up the mystery of

796
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:38,880
compensation which is well known in

797
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,230
plant biology when there some

798
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,240
perturbation happens in there's fewer

799
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,880
cells they increase their size to get

800
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,950
nearly normal organ size whereas if

801
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,740
there's more cells they decrease their

802
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:51,450
size to get nearly normal organ size so

803
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:54,569
obviously organ size is much more

804
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:56,250
complicated what we've seen is that the

805
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:59,389
way this happens is in part because

806
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:02,009
growth does not depend on cell division

807
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,570
so Gerardo and Heather published a very

808
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:05,609
nice paper in plant physiology where

809
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:08,339
they analyzed the growth of sepal cells

810
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:11,789
and so here's a single cell lineage so

811
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:13,709
we've got this and it grows like this

812
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:16,649
over time and in each cell division

813
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,730
event is marked with an orange arrow you

814
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,850
can see that cell division has

815
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:22,890
absolutely no effect on the growth if we

816
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:26,059
look at all the cells in the sepal and

817
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:28,860
look at okay the red is all the cell's

818
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:30,720
purple is the non-dividing and Daru

819
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:32,339
duplicating cells and green is the

820
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,490
dividing cells and their growth curves

821
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:37,230
are essentially exactly identical so it

822
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:39,299
doesn't matter for cells dividing or in

823
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,950
duplicating is growing the same way and

824
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,779
that's how you get this trade-off where

825
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:47,819
and reduplication versus division does

826
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:49,319
not affect sepals area okay so we have

827
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:51,269
completely not answered the question of

828
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:53,549
sepal size so now we need to look at how

829
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:57,029
do variable cells promote these uniform

830
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:59,069
organs and this is a again this is the

831
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:02,369
project work on my my postdoc dr. Whelan

832
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:04,439
home and it's a question that fascinated

833
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:06,899
an international interdisciplinary team

834
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,480
of research and we got a human frontiers

835
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,940
grant to fund this work so we're the

836
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,119
biologists and we work together with a

837
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,028
rescue Buddhahood

838
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,970
you want Olivia's a cell biologist and a

839
00:34:16,028 --> 00:34:20,168
rescues of physicists and France we work

840
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:21,848
with Richard Smith who I mentioned

841
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:25,838
before who created the more for graphic

842
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:27,970
software in Cologne Germany and Jim

843
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:30,190
bewdley and tamika come up Sasaki in

844
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:31,959
Japan here we are all in Germany

845
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:35,619
drinking five liters of beer and we made

846
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,148
it through more than one of those and as

847
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:40,358
I said this is funded by human frontiers

848
00:34:37,148 --> 00:34:42,368
program so the question that fascinated

849
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:43,239
us is the same question we've been

850
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:45,159
talking about how do you go from

851
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:48,459
cellular variability to organ regularity

852
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,318
well as geneticists if we want to know

853
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,148
what controls a process we need to

854
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:54,909
disrupt it so we need to find a mutant

855
00:34:52,148 --> 00:34:56,528
that disrupts the process and if we want

856
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:57,849
to know what creates regular organs we

857
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:59,858
need to find mutants that don't have

858
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:01,930
regular organs that have variable organs

859
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:05,528
so we screen for mutants with variable

860
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:07,568
sepal size in the same flower and this

861
00:35:05,528 --> 00:35:09,460
is a really novel screen no one has done

862
00:35:07,568 --> 00:35:11,949
this before screening for variable organ

863
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,599
sizing either plants or animals people

864
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:15,848
have screened for bigger or smaller but

865
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,318
never variable and it's one of the first

866
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,910
screens to actually look for variability

867
00:35:17,318 --> 00:35:21,849
at all there's been a few previous

868
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:24,759
screens in yeast and Leland found the

869
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:26,680
spectacular mutant called FTS h4 and FQ

870
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:29,230
stage four completely nails variability

871
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:31,449
it's got everything going on so here's

872
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:34,028
here's our wild-type flower and it's got

873
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:35,649
its four same size sepals here's three

874
00:35:34,028 --> 00:35:38,440
different F G SH four flowers from the

875
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:40,900
same plant one is perfectly normal one

876
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,298
this one has one normal sepal here and a

877
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,769
couple smaller sepals here you can see

878
00:35:43,298 --> 00:35:47,230
it also affects the other floral organs

879
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:49,508
and this poor flower has all four

880
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,400
smaller sepals if we look at earlier

881
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:52,929
stages where the sepals in wild-type

882
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,999
close the flower bud because they're all

883
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:56,440
the same size we can see again there's

884
00:35:54,998 --> 00:35:57,769
some normal flowers and there are some

885
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,889
flowers that are open

886
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:04,280
has it got smaller sepals some normal

887
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:06,739
sepals and some smaller sepals so Leland

888
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,200
quantified this to verify we've got

889
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:11,929
sepal area and wild-type has a very

890
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:14,210
small variability in sepal area whereas

891
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:17,899
f2 stage for mutants have a much larger

892
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:19,670
variability in sepal area and so the

893
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,519
next question is when does the defect

894
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:25,579
arise is this a problem in growth versus

895
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:27,739
a problem in initiation so Leland looked

896
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:29,750
at very early simple development the

897
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:31,279
sepals arise as primordia on the flanks

898
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,920
of the floral meristem here you've got

899
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,120
the four sepals they rapidly grow and

900
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,889
start to cover the floor immerse them

901
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,650
and they completely cover it and close

902
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:41,809
the seat the flower here in F th for the

903
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:43,730
C pole primordia rise normally they

904
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:45,019
start to grow normally and it's when

905
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:46,400
they're trying to close the flower that

906
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:48,409
you see it start to see problems if

907
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,990
flowers not quite closing the sepals

908
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:52,759
lagging behind it's not catching up the

909
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:55,579
sepals lagging behind and leaving a gap

910
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,980
and again another gap is forming so the

911
00:36:55,579 --> 00:37:01,670
problem is not in the initiation but in

912
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,320
the growth of the sepals so we wanted to

913
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:05,349
think about this from a modeling

914
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,760
perspective and ask the question you

915
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:09,500
know how to sell you a variability give

916
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,330
rise to organ regularity and we need to

917
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,760
think about what we should look at here

918
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:16,009
and so we started with some modeling and

919
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,530
we base the modeling on our atomic force

920
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:21,590
microscopy data looking at variability

921
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:23,320
in cell wall stiffness so rescue Matilda

922
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,880
made a model where they've got a

923
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:28,160
mechanical sheet of tissue and they put

924
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,190
different stiffnesses into it so black

925
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:34,250
is stiff and great a white is soft and

926
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:35,900
they replicate this variability based on

927
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:39,730
the atomic force microscopy data and

928
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,730
then they see what happens

929
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:51,210
oh we got a nose that's definitely not a

930
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:52,769
sepal and if we run this model again

931
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:54,449
again from different starting conditions

932
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:56,548
we never get a people out we might get a

933
00:37:54,449 --> 00:37:59,279
Drosophila wing or like a wing disc or

934
00:37:56,548 --> 00:38:02,429
something but we never get a sepal so

935
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:06,960
clearly this model that has variability

936
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:09,179
in space does not produce regular sepals

937
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,490
but then we thought what if we make

938
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:14,480
variability in space and in time so the

939
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:16,679
idea here is that each element is

940
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,480
changing its stiffness in time you can

941
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:21,179
see that sometimes it's soft sometimes

942
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,329
it's stiff and that's producing very

943
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:27,598
regular sepals if we run it again and

944
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:30,329
again we get lots of regular sepals so

945
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,460
variability in space and in time leads

946
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:33,809
to regular sepals now these are pretty

947
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,880
extreme models this doesn't represent

948
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:37,920
wild-type ramune these are extremes but

949
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,490
they give us an idea what to think about

950
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,220
and what to look for in the biology and

951
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:46,048
so in its virtual sepal we see that

952
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:48,209
cellular variability in space plus

953
00:38:46,048 --> 00:38:50,009
seller variability in time gives us

954
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:52,380
regular organ morphology and the

955
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:55,260
question is is that what happens in the

956
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:57,088
real sepal this is what's going on so we

957
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,849
went did live imaging where she's

958
00:38:57,088 --> 00:39:01,409
watching the seagull grow and she's got

959
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:02,730
a plasma Marine marker so she can track

960
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:06,568
every cell in its growth here's

961
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:08,099
wild-type here's the mutant neftis h4

962
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:09,929
mutant you can see that it's having its

963
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:11,490
typical problem where the sepals aren't

964
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:12,798
closing because the growth isn't quite

965
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:15,479
right

966
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:17,750
and so if she uses more for graphics to

967
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,298
analyze the growth in every cell and

968
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:23,210
we've got a heat map here with red

969
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:24,889
growth red fast growth and blue slow

970
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:26,780
you can see in wild-type there's

971
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:28,818
considerable variability and growth and

972
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:31,640
then the mutant it looks also fairly

973
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:34,009
variable so we took a very close look at

974
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:35,690
the variability and first we know we

975
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:38,450
need to analyze the variability in space

976
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:41,000
and so we take each cell and look at all

977
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:43,879
of its neighbors and assess how variable

978
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,159
is this cell relative to it how variable

979
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,740
our neighboring cells and we do that

980
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,750
throughout the sepal we get an average

981
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:53,568
variability and so we've got wild-type

982
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:57,199
plotted in blue here mutant plotted in

983
00:39:53,568 --> 00:39:59,960
pink and so going from low variability

984
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:02,088
to high variability over time and what

985
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,940
we find is actually wild-type is more

986
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:06,318
variable from the mutant now initially

987
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:09,440
without the modeling this would be a

988
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:12,500
huge surprise how is more variability

989
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,440
giving rise to more regular organs and

990
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:18,980
less variability gives more screwed up

991
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,139
organs you can see here's the average

992
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:24,318
wild-type it's definitely above the

993
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:26,088
average mutant so then we know we need

994
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,099
to look at variability in time as well

995
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:29,630
that's the next part of the model so we

996
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:30,980
look at a cell and how much does its

997
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,750
growth rate change at the next time

998
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,690
point so this one changes a lot and this

999
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:37,369
one changes very little and then we see

1000
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,530
that wild type of mutant are largely

1001
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:41,480
overlapping so there's high variability

1002
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,430
to low variability on the y-axis and

1003
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,338
time

1004
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:49,480
the x-axis and you can see that the blue

1005
00:40:45,338 --> 00:40:51,400
wild-type and the pink mutant are maybe

1006
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,380
the mutants a little less variable but

1007
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,869
they're overlapping enough it I will

1008
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,670
call it even

1009
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:59,289
finally we looked at variability in cell

1010
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:01,838
wall mechanics cell while stiffness

1011
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:03,819
using atomic force microscopy and so

1012
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,400
we're looking at how does each spot

1013
00:41:03,818 --> 00:41:08,019
relate to its neighboring spots and wild

1014
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,240
type versus mutant so we've got

1015
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:13,210
variability here and wild type is more

1016
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,828
spatially variable than the music so

1017
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:20,108
again the Lita's has reduced variability

1018
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:21,970
so in wild-type we've got high

1019
00:41:20,108 --> 00:41:24,278
variability and space high variability

1020
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:26,108
in time and this is regular seat bolts

1021
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:28,000
whereas in the mutant we've got low

1022
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:30,038
variability in space about the same

1023
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,190
variability in time and this is

1024
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:35,109
producing irregular seat bones so we

1025
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,170
wanted to test this in the model if we

1026
00:41:35,108 --> 00:41:39,818
reduced variability in space do we get

1027
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:42,220
more irregular seat bones like what we

1028
00:41:39,818 --> 00:41:43,960
see in the mutant so here's our normal

1029
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:46,209
seat bones with high very building space

1030
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,980
and time if we reduce the variability in

1031
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,568
space and that means making each of

1032
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,298
these spots bigger so that's what you're

1033
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:54,608
seeing here bigger spots so reduced

1034
00:41:52,298 --> 00:41:56,469
variability then we get more irregular

1035
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:58,480
sepals you can see these are not as

1036
00:41:56,469 --> 00:42:00,489
regular got different slightly different

1037
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,769
sizes and different shapes so that is

1038
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:04,389
much more like the mutant so just

1039
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:07,050
reducing variability in space can

1040
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:13,500
produce more like mutant phenotype

1041
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:17,100
and so then we asked how do you go from

1042
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,710
cellular variability to Oregon regular

1043
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:21,630
organ morphology with the southern

1044
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:23,490
variability of space and time and leland

1045
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:26,250
looked at the principal direction of

1046
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:27,869
growth which is the main direction cells

1047
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:30,210
growing in so if you take this green

1048
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:31,949
cell and it grows to be this red cell

1049
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,630
it's growing mostly in this direction so

1050
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:35,730
we've got a little line here indicating

1051
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,550
that that's shown by the white lines

1052
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:40,199
here on each cell and so over each

1053
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,880
24-hour period you can see there's quite

1054
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:43,649
a bit of variability in growth direction

1055
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,740
that's what we expect we see a ton of

1056
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:49,079
variability but what's remarkable is if

1057
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:51,929
we look over the whole 48 hour interval

1058
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:55,139
at the growth we see that now suddenly

1059
00:42:51,929 --> 00:42:57,480
it's aligning most of these growth

1060
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:59,369
directions of these cells over 48 hours

1061
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,349
have a line and so that the sepal is

1062
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:03,869
growing much more normally over a long

1063
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:06,960
time you can see how this happens this

1064
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:08,670
cells pointing a little bit to the right

1065
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,070
then it's pointing a little bit to the

1066
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:14,460
left and that averages out to point with

1067
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:15,930
this overall growth of the seat Bowl so

1068
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,730
cellular variability is undergoing

1069
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:20,519
spatial temporal averaging this is a

1070
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:22,710
concept from physics that we're now

1071
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:23,929
seeing in biology to produce organ

1072
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:25,900
regularity

1073
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:29,149
so what about the mutant the mutants

1074
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:31,849
variable and variable but it doesn't do

1075
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:35,119
this spatial-temporal averaging after 48

1076
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:37,010
hours the directions are still highly

1077
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,380
variable and it if you go longer it

1078
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:41,420
still does an average so this cell is

1079
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:43,460
growing quite to the right it's still

1080
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,048
growing a bit to the right and it over

1081
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,798
48 hours it's growing a bit to the right

1082
00:43:45,048 --> 00:43:50,239
so it's not average incurring so what

1083
00:43:48,798 --> 00:43:53,588
causes the failure or spatial temporal

1084
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:55,759
averaging in fds h4 immunes we like used

1085
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:57,469
positional cloning clone the gene and

1086
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,690
found much to our surprise it's a

1087
00:43:57,469 --> 00:44:02,088
mitochondrial protease

1088
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:04,730
so this prettiest has a ATPase domain

1089
00:44:02,088 --> 00:44:06,288
and a Proteus domain and it sits in the

1090
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,559
inner membrane of the mitochondria and

1091
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:11,240
it's a bit of a garbage collector it's

1092
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,730
degrading unfolded proteins particularly

1093
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:15,858
in the ox vas pathway it can also help

1094
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:21,769
proteins fold so it's it's doing both

1095
00:44:15,858 --> 00:44:23,420
sides of quality control and it really

1096
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:24,980
mutates to this variable organ size

1097
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,470
phenotype Leyland pulled out six

1098
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:31,909
different alleles in our screen in this

1099
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:32,808
gene FGS h4 is highly conserved across

1100
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:38,239
kingdoms

1101
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:41,210
so it's here's the conservation from a

1102
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:42,919
rabbit OPS's to human to yeast to e.coli

1103
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:45,349
and you can see in the Proteus domain

1104
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,789
underlined in red and the sorry the

1105
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:49,400
ATPase domain underlined in red and the

1106
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:54,140
Proteus domain in green that it's highly

1107
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:56,000
conserved so how do we go from this FD s

1108
00:44:54,139 --> 00:44:57,288
h4 mutation generates mitochondrial

1109
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,838
defects to reduce spacial temporal

1110
00:44:57,289 --> 00:45:01,369
averaging well one possibility is

1111
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,889
increased reactive oxygen species

1112
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:05,510
mitochondrial defects often include it

1113
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:07,779
caused the accumulation of reactive

1114
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:10,570
oxygen species particularly super ox

1115
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:13,060
hydrogen peroxide so lean on stain

1116
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:15,519
looking for reactive oxygen species and

1117
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:17,920
she found greatly increased super ah

1118
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:19,300
sorry hydrogen peroxide accumulation you

1119
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,119
can see it's very darkly stained

1120
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,650
compared to wild-type and she also saw

1121
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,239
superoxide accumulation

1122
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:27,250
so here's wild-type that's got a little

1123
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:29,199
bit and here's the mutant to see it it's

1124
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:31,300
gotten very early and very much

1125
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:32,829
increased in fairly variable superoxide

1126
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:36,730
some sepals are very darkly stained

1127
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:38,710
while others are not so if it's the

1128
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:42,039
reactive oxygen species in the mutant

1129
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:43,900
causing the phenotype then we should be

1130
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,309
able to reproduce the phenotype by

1131
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,619
treating plants with hydrogen peroxide

1132
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:50,079
and that's in fact exactly what happened

1133
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:51,849
when Leland dips wild-type plant in

1134
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,769
hydrogen peroxide she can get out

1135
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:57,279
variable sepal size particularly these

1136
00:45:53,769 --> 00:45:59,349
smaller sepals just like the mutant now

1137
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,730
conversely if it's really the reactive

1138
00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:02,679
oxygen species we should be able to

1139
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:05,619
remove reactive oxygen species from the

1140
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:07,960
mutants and rescue it and that's what

1141
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:09,849
happens so if she over expresses

1142
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,869
catalase which degrades hydrogen

1143
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:15,009
peroxide she can rescue normal see full

1144
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:17,529
development and I'll just give you a

1145
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:21,490
hint these sepals look even larger than

1146
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:23,590
wild-type so how is Ross doing this

1147
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:25,089
Ross affects a whole lot of signal

1148
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,890
transduction mechanisms so it's probably

1149
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:28,390
doing a bunch of different things but

1150
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:30,250
one thing that it could be doing is

1151
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:33,309
causing cross-linking of the cell wall

1152
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:37,360
and so we looked at stiffness of the

1153
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:39,190
cell wall and we find that in fact the

1154
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:42,210
mutant cell walls are in general stiffer

1155
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:44,220
so here's a

1156
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:47,039
heatmap again where we've got stiff and

1157
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:49,379
red and soft and blue you can see that

1158
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:53,460
the mutant is overall stiffer than

1159
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:55,380
wild-type so this makes us ask do

1160
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:57,509
reactive oxygen species actually

1161
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,499
regulate wild-type CL development and

1162
00:46:57,509 --> 00:47:02,849
when I looked at this I was really

1163
00:46:58,498 --> 00:47:04,618
excited because I saw that reactive

1164
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:05,220
oxygen species were accumulating in the

1165
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:08,579
wild-type

1166
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:12,209
in a tip to base gradient as the seafoam

1167
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:14,818
matures and that reminded me of the

1168
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:16,380
growth pattern so in young sepals

1169
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:18,329
they're growing rapidly throughout and

1170
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,759
then they start to slow from the tip if

1171
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:23,278
this blue slow growth and it descends

1172
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:27,318
toward the base very much reminiscent of

1173
00:47:23,278 --> 00:47:30,690
this pattern so we can ask is Ross a

1174
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:32,730
mechanism of maturation and to ask this

1175
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:35,548
what we should see in the mutant is that

1176
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:38,579
the mutant matures prematurely and

1177
00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:40,380
that's exactly what we see so we've got

1178
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:42,180
wild-type you can see that it's starting

1179
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,849
to mature from the tip just starting to

1180
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:46,528
whereas the mutant is blue pretty much

1181
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:50,099
throughout the sepal at these later time

1182
00:47:46,528 --> 00:47:51,960
points so it's occurring early so if

1183
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:53,700
Ross is really acting as the signal

1184
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,220
terminating growth in wild-type it

1185
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:59,368
should increase sepal size if we remove

1186
00:47:56,219 --> 00:48:02,038
the Ross in wild-type so we take our

1187
00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:05,430
wild type plants and overexpress either

1188
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:07,739
ascorbate oxidase or catalase and we can

1189
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:09,318
get larger sepals just by reducing the

1190
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:12,059
reactive oxygen species in wild-type

1191
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:14,818
whereas if we overexpress our Bo HD

1192
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:17,990
which is NADPH oxidase produces too much

1193
00:48:14,818 --> 00:48:20,820
Ross then we get smaller sepals

1194
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:22,859
so to conclude we found that variability

1195
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:25,080
produces regularity which is really kind

1196
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,120
of a remarkable thought so their

1197
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:29,279
variability undergoing spatial temporal

1198
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:32,069
averaging gives rise to organ regularity

1199
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,740
reactive oxygen species inhibit spatial

1200
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:36,600
temporal averaging and they seem to form

1201
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:38,599
a major signal inducing the maturation

1202
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:40,980
of the organ and termination of growth

1203
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:43,589
so Leyland published this in a beautiful

1204
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:45,539
paper and developmental cell and in the

1205
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:47,550
future we want to know how does Ross

1206
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:49,829
affect spatial temporal averaging at a

1207
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:52,740
more mechanistic level following up on

1208
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:54,690
the mechanics what mechanism produces

1209
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:57,959
Ross and wild-type to terminate siebel

1210
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:59,760
growth and what other genes contribute

1211
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,440
to sequel sighs regularity so Leland's

1212
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,910
pulled out additional mutants but

1213
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,920
variable organ size mutants and is

1214
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:06,210
following up on a bunch of them and I

1215
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,250
particularly might want to mention the

1216
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:10,199
variable organ size two mutant the

1217
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:12,360
encode gene encodes a mid domain

1218
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:14,819
transcription factor this is being

1219
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,950
worked on by menu N and this one is

1220
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:19,200
really interesting so here's wild-type

1221
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:20,789
with its four equal size evils here's

1222
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:23,099
the mutant you can see variable c full

1223
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:25,710
size it's really interesting because it

1224
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:27,809
is affecting the primordial formation so

1225
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:29,309
it's got defects where the primordium

1226
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:30,690
don't form normally the sequel

1227
00:49:29,309 --> 00:49:33,480
primordium so it's affecting the other

1228
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:36,030
end of the scale we saw fgs h4 is

1229
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,619
affecting termination and vastu is now

1230
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:41,670
picking initiation so we're hoping we

1231
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:43,859
can put this all together so just to

1232
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:45,930
summarize everything we've got our

1233
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:47,370
spatial temporal averaging of cellular

1234
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:50,309
ability to produce organ regularity

1235
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:52,529
we've found a new patterning mechanism

1236
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:55,049
where fluctuations in 18 will once or

1237
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:58,290
pass a threshold during g2 that triggers

1238
00:49:55,050 --> 00:50:00,960
end or duplication via Lego and that

1239
00:49:58,289 --> 00:50:03,210
leads to proper organ curvature

1240
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,309
and reactive oxygen species inhibit

1241
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,929
spatial-temporal averaging and induce a

1242
00:50:05,309 --> 00:50:10,790
maturation and termination of growth I

1243
00:50:06,929 --> 00:50:12,659
want to mention a few other

1244
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:15,659
collaborations going on with tips and

1245
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:17,509
future directions and so Dena is also

1246
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:20,399
looking at the relationship between

1247
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:22,440
ploidy polyploidy with whole genome

1248
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,358
duplication and endo polyploidy and how

1249
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,250
that relates to cell size and organ size

1250
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:27,929
and that that's really an extension of

1251
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:30,960
our work in a new direction and that's

1252
00:50:27,929 --> 00:50:32,699
in collaboration with Jeff Doyle and Jo

1253
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,470
is a joint graduate student with Mike

1254
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:37,009
Scanlon and he's looking at asymmetric

1255
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:39,389
division in the Moss apical cell and

1256
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:41,700
Leland's been working club meeting with

1257
00:50:39,389 --> 00:50:43,440
members of Jos roses lab looking at the

1258
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:44,549
dynamics of cuticle Ridge formation on

1259
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,519
the sepal and there's a paper in

1260
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,839
revision for a molecular plant and

1261
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:51,659
Leland's also worked with Thomas

1262
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:54,058
Bjorkman looking at Ross in broccoli and

1263
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:55,649
it looks very much like a rabbit ops

1264
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:59,579
assist accumulating the same way in the

1265
00:50:55,650 --> 00:51:03,389
sepals so I'd really like to thank the

1266
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:06,660
members of my lab in particular Leland

1267
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:09,379
did the work on organ size and Heather

1268
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:11,969
did the work on a team Owen fluctuations

1269
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:13,289
Sheehan was my first graduate student

1270
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:15,689
and did the work that I didn't have time

1271
00:51:13,289 --> 00:51:17,940
to talk about insect 24 and I've told

1272
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:21,000
you what Ming Ewan and Dana and Joe and

1273
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,369
Lila are doing this works been funded by

1274
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,280
the NSF and the human frontiers we have

1275
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:28,619
fantastic collaborators particularly

1276
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:32,339
henrik Johnson and James lock in their

1277
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:36,990
postdocs Josie and Pao and a

1278
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:39,029
Olivier Richard and Jim view Lee and so

1279
00:51:36,989 --> 00:51:41,848
I want to say that this is really the

1280
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:43,079
result of the hard work of my lab and

1281
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:45,550
the inspiration of their lab and their

1282
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:47,289
ideas all coming together

1283
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:48,580
and so here's my lab over time so I

1284
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:50,440
really want to thank my lab has been

1285
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:52,360
great working with you guys and I look

1286
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,139
forward to all the future results we're

1287
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,530
gonna have what you're gonna be

1288
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:58,389
spectacular and I also want to thank our

1289
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,370
collaborators these collaborations are

1290
00:51:58,389 --> 00:52:02,619
really intense we meet every two to

1291
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:04,389
three weeks on skype we email all the

1292
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,009
time these guys feel like lab members

1293
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:08,769
and we're always talking to each other

1294
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:11,680
we even meet in person this this one's

1295
00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:13,389
in Singapore and so it's been really

1296
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:15,309
great collaborations and it's allowed us

1297
00:52:13,389 --> 00:52:16,690
to do things that we couldn't do just as

1298
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:17,679
a lab by ourselves because we've got

1299
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:20,409
these different disciplinary

1300
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:22,329
perspectives coming together I'd like to

1301
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:24,670
just finish by thanking plant biology in

1302
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:26,650
the wild Institute for being my home for

1303
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:28,740
the last five years and hopefully the

1304
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:28,740
future

1305
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:33,039
thank you and I'd be happy to take any

1306
00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:33,039
questions

1307
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:53,929
this is you must be so we we have taken

1308
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:58,369
a small look at this and what we looked

1309
00:52:53,929 --> 00:52:59,779
at is a 20 second 24 promoter we looked

1310
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:02,239
at that because we have it available

1311
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:04,700
former secretary for work and it ain't

1312
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:08,089
no one definitely has more differences

1313
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:09,349
because it results in 24 now that's

1314
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,850
exactly what your viewers are not the

1315
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:12,440
student assistant look at different

1316
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:17,360
transcription factors and Heather it is

1317
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:19,070
currently growing but I think either way

1318
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,750
it comes out it's still interesting and

1319
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,750
maybe we found a little property

1320
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:59,330
so it the pack yeah so there's obviously

1321
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,739
a pattern in time of how many cells are

1322
00:53:59,329 --> 00:54:03,349
entering a very application and it is

1323
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:05,000
changing in time it's particularly

1324
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:06,380
complicated by the fact that at the end

1325
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,670
we've got to model with all that

1326
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,230
happening and those cells are not

1327
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:11,720
inherited locating it also extract

1328
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:14,659
undergo a second so this is actually a

1329
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:17,329
key point is that Giants the vagina cell

1330
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:18,829
forms a serrano cell cannot form because

1331
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:21,159
it takes an assault out of the poverty

1332
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:24,730
process

1333
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:29,849
the rate does change in time we've got

1334
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:29,849
some clarification of that yeah

1335
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:37,110
does the periodicity of this I'll say

1336
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:40,449
will change or giant cells versus

1337
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:42,849
regular self

1338
00:54:40,449 --> 00:54:44,019
so we don't actually know the answer to

1339
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:45,579
that question it's something I'd really

1340
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:47,440
like to know because one of the

1341
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:52,150
hypotheses is that under duplicating

1342
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,920
cells make cycle faster the problem is

1343
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:56,680
we need a good soft cycle marker that

1344
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:01,769
still cycles in dendritic cells the same

1345
00:54:56,679 --> 00:55:03,969
as in the case of ourselves and we don't

1346
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:05,900
you don't get have that but we might

1347
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:09,019
have looking

1348
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:12,230
so yeah okay so the first question will

1349
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:14,389
do question first question is do other

1350
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:17,809
mutants that have Ross accumulation also

1351
00:55:14,389 --> 00:55:22,909
lead to this variable phenotype and this

1352
00:55:17,809 --> 00:55:25,039
actually is a very interesting point fkc

1353
00:55:22,909 --> 00:55:27,199
explores particular variable because PRS

1354
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:28,940
accumulation is also variable and that

1355
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,069
leaves what we've seen is that that

1356
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:34,030
means the variability that size in

1357
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:36,920
particular but just Ross accumulation

1358
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:39,590
leads to much more variability in shape

1359
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:42,980
so in for example when we overexpress

1360
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:44,390
the NADPH oxidase and priests

1361
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,610
accumulation of Ross we tend to get

1362
00:55:44,389 --> 00:55:49,489
equally smaller sepals but they have

1363
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:50,930
much more variability of shape and for

1364
00:55:49,489 --> 00:55:53,539
something that I didn't mention in the

1365
00:55:50,929 --> 00:55:56,239
model when we decrease spatial-temporal

1366
00:55:53,539 --> 00:55:59,869
averaging by decreasing variability we

1367
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:02,989
get we get more variable shape of

1368
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:05,059
particulars so it fits with this facial

1369
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:09,109
typography they're having a key role in

1370
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:12,320
shaping smaller on the one side so it is

1371
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:14,180
slightly more complex yes so the

1372
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,210
question is is it necessary to have the

1373
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:19,159
downstream target also have a threshold

1374
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:21,019
we propose a downstream target because

1375
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:22,328
it's a transcription factor having

1376
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:25,900
something

1377
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:27,309
I don't know that it's necessary for the

1378
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,259
target have a threshold but it really

1379
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:30,880
does give us nice dynamics that look

1380
00:56:29,259 --> 00:56:32,739
very much like our data with the soft

1381
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,729
threshold of a table one and that's

1382
00:56:32,739 --> 00:56:35,228
really something we're going to have to

1383
00:56:33,728 --> 00:56:37,239
test for the future particularly whether

1384
00:56:35,228 --> 00:56:39,399
it Lego has some kind of harder

1385
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:40,778
threshold like this or not and the

1386
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,699
question is really is like you're the

1387
00:56:40,778 --> 00:56:45,409
target or is that something else and are

1388
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:49,450
there basically

1389
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:49,449
we do know genetically like accessory

1390
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:59,810
is it possible than the FT Sh for Ross

1391
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:00,530
effect is actually regulating 1801 as

1392
00:56:59,809 --> 00:57:02,809
well

1393
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:05,000
I noticed that a female one has this

1394
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:07,299
start going

1395
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,440
which usually binds cholesterol an

1396
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:11,269
oxidation of cholesterol is well

1397
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,750
characterized and I wonderful break leg

1398
00:57:11,269 --> 00:57:17,710
active on the transcription factor

1399
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:21,519
so the question is as Ross regulating it

1400
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:25,840
tomorrow on very interesting hypothesis

1401
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:28,329
so far we don't see any obvious defects

1402
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,280
in giant cells and fth or beautiful

1403
00:57:28,329 --> 00:57:32,199
parts of Hurricane Ike Roscoe we don't

1404
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,210
we don't see a connection of the

1405
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:36,368
patterning there the start domain is

1406
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:38,380
fascinating because yet as you say in

1407
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:41,530
animals the optimal blind cholesterol

1408
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,940
and we don't know what it's actually

1409
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:44,260
doing in plants except that it's

1410
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:48,090
important have been a lot of people

1411
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,090
trying to figure it out and I'm hoping

1412
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:07,150
that's another interesting question is

1413
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:09,639
Ross an intracellular signal or not

1414
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:12,170
what's thought is that how your

1415
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:14,719
approximately superoxide can also

1416
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:17,000
produce it's very interesting ideas we

1417
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:18,098
have not yet tested that you also see

1418
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,239
people in her

1419
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:25,599
and one of you says we're going to do

1420
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:27,039
the flat reveal but I do think there is

1421
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,479
something interesting going on there how

1422
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:30,220
much are each of these different species

1423
00:58:28,478 --> 00:58:32,518
moving in those that contributed to

1424
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:32,518
things

1425
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:44,670
okay well thank you very much this has

1426
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:50,389
been a production of Cornell University

1427
