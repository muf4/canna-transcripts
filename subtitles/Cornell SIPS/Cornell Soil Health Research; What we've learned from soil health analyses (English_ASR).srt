1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:15,048
all right good morning again beautiful

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,780
day I think a little warmer remember

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:19,189
yesterday when we were out in in front

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,740
of the building back field we've got

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,599
pots come with the landscaping in a lot

8
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:26,959
all that and actually this area right

9
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:30,618
outside man library here was part of a

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,560
project that was led by Nina basak I

11
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:35,990
miss her earlier seats the she directs

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,750
the Urban horticulture initiative and

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:42,079
she has a class and in her class they

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,759
they take on a little project like right

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,549
in front of the library or in front of

16
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,530
another building and a amend the soil

17
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:51,099
like I said they bring in the compost

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,420
and the and the mulch and all that and

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,570
and then she's been doing that for I

20
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,609
know 1215 years and some point times had

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,530
had a grad student who make that a

22
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:04,640
project and then looked at the long-term

23
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:06,618
impact of the sort of remediation but

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,629
you can just do an you know anecdotal

25
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:10,969
assessment maybe when you have a few

26
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:13,640
minutes and on the break-ins walk out

27
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:16,819
here and see how how nice the vegetation

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:22,849
looks it really is all right so I'm

29
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:25,099
gonna talk about but some of the

30
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:28,640
research results so we you've seen the

31
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:31,250
our soil health testing or analysis

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,750
infrastructure and we over the years

33
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,209
we've done some research for that and I

34
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,329
wanted to show you the results of that

35
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:41,689
and give you some insights so one set of

36
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:44,870
experiments involve different tillage

37
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:48,439
treatments and we Bob and I started an

38
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:53,540
experiment 24 over 25 years ago

39
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:55,849
and we kept it going and so typically

40
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,400
when you go to a no-till or strip till

41
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:01,250
type system where you don't disturb the

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,170
soil you tend to see kind of an

43
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,299
improvement of soil health I mean just

44
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,689
generically speaking soil health as

45
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:11,629
measured by different indicators if you

46
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:15,318
do cover cropping you tend to see a

47
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:18,378
quicker response because you know when

48
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:20,589
you do no-till you just you don't you

49
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:20,590
don't

50
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,390
you slowly improve the soil by not

51
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,489
disturbing it when you you use a cover

52
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:31,979
crop or you apply manure compost you

53
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:35,340
more quickly because you're getting an

54
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:38,068
injection basically of biological

55
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,800
organic material to typically have a

56
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:43,619
faster response right at least that's

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,830
what we hypothesized and so we started

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,019
to include cover crops about five years

59
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,480
ago after we hired a new colleague Matt

60
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:54,120
Ryan who was an expert on that and he

61
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,879
has an interceder or to use that so one

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,900
of the hypotheses was if you combine

63
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,068
practices do you get more impact more

64
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,079
positive impact

65
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:05,848
are they really additive right can you

66
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:08,670
can you say that so that was our

67
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:10,348
hypothesis and so we did a whole bunch

68
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:12,568
of analysis using our sort of help test

69
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:15,389
and I won't go into too much detail but

70
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:17,399
let's first see what is the effect of no

71
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:19,768
tilling versus flowering and this is

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,530
more or less in continuous corn which is

73
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,819
really not an ideal system but we see

74
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,579
that for example aggregate stability

75
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:28,108
active carbon and protein we see a

76
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,750
fairly significant increase especially

77
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:32,850
with aggregate stability we saw a 92%

78
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,219
increase that's really good

79
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:37,310
if you don't disturb the soil and

80
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:41,599
especially you have a benefit with a

81
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:46,079
disability but also with these more

82
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:53,189
labile organic matter indicators active

83
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:55,290
carbon than air yes in question I would

84
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,509
say that works on just about every type

85
00:03:55,289 --> 00:04:00,090
of soil yeah and this one will always

86
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:06,419
see their benefit from no-till so you

87
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:09,239
know with the special increases if you

88
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,949
yes yes if you do it right now you may

89
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,370
have some real challenges with no-till

90
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:17,009
on say more clay high clay content soil

91
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,418
and say sandy sort of but you'll see in

92
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:20,548
terms of sort of health you'll see

93
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,680
consistent benefits in fact we we had

94
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:24,989
some other experiments so this is a

95
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,740
lonely soil silt loam and we also had

96
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:31,889
experiments on clay loam soil and and in

97
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,629
sandy soil and we basically saw same

98
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:33,979
effect that we can maybe Joseph we

99
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:35,540
should

100
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,930
with some of those papers on the on the

101
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:43,129
box so yeah you do see those those

102
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:46,250
benefits now again if you if you go into

103
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:50,259
a no-till system you typically see it's

104
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:54,199
certainly a lot easier to do that on a

105
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:56,209
more sandy horse textured soil right so

106
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,250
for example that's on the Delmarva

107
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:00,500
Peninsula you see very high adoption of

108
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,639
no tell because the soils are really

109
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,959
quite amenable to that so let's so we

110
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,819
looked at they get an effective tillage

111
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:10,069
and now we have till it's plus cover

112
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:13,579
crops all right so this is plow Hill no

113
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:15,589
cover crop with cover crop and no-till

114
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,949
no cover crop and auto with cover crop

115
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:20,989
and you see that even after three years

116
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,779
we see that the there's an additive

117
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:29,780
effect of the benefits of the cover crop

118
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:31,579
so reducing tillage gives you an are

119
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:33,709
your stability organic matter but you

120
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,629
know by adding a cover crop you seen

121
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,609
this additional benefit which is really

122
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:40,339
nice you know because when we think

123
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:43,160
about my first presentation yesterday

124
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:45,229
where we're talking about some of these

125
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,300
cropping systems exporting a lot of the

126
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,069
carbon and the nutrients and so how do

127
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,530
you make up for that how do you how do

128
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:54,170
you keep that system sustainable well

129
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:57,589
reducing tillage bring in a cover crop

130
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,540
seems to be helping you maintain some of

131
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:01,969
that soil health now these are not

132
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,770
always significant but you know the

133
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,590
trend is definitely there and it was

134
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:09,649
only after a few years so I think that's

135
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:11,599
kind of good news right here's another

136
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:14,029
study this is working with the

137
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,580
announcement and North Carolina State

138
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:20,409
University they had a number of long

139
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:22,969
term till its trials like 26 years and

140
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:26,320
did some sampling sent the samples to

141
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:29,450
our lab and and things got analyzed and

142
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,480
this is was a very interesting study in

143
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:34,219
terms of the conclusions because one of

144
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,280
the real challenges with Sorrell house

145
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:40,130
is can you demonstrate that it increases

146
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,859
yields right because ultimately a farmer

147
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:45,589
might say yes oral health that's great

148
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,150
but how does it help me because there

149
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:47,659
may be some input cost you know cover

150
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:50,239
cropping

151
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:54,050
cost you money maybe cost you $30 an

152
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,600
acre right or going to no-till requires

153
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,550
investment in equipment so does it

154
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,610
increase the bottom line so I here this

155
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,079
graph shows you that the three different

156
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:07,100
tillage systems that were being used

157
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:08,659
conventional plowing no-till or it's

158
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,810
actually a minimum till you might say

159
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,750
and then chisel which is kind of an

160
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,790
in-between practice so what does this

161
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,889
graph show you here and shows you the

162
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:22,610
relationship between protein so one of

163
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:26,060
the indicators and tell us and you can

164
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:28,250
see that as you reduce tillage you

165
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,490
increase the protein content of the soil

166
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:34,220
based on ignore this for now so you get

167
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,250
more protein if you reduce tillage so so

168
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,500
it seems to be unfavorable in terms of

169
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,790
the protein content the second thing

170
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:46,850
that you see here is as Tillis increases

171
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:50,870
protein it also is associated with

172
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:53,450
higher yield right and these are quite

173
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,629
significant I mean the yields are is the

174
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:58,219
70% higher in the minimum till system

175
00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:00,439
and it's also associated with higher

176
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,710
protein it doesn't mean that if you

177
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:05,750
throw a lot of protein on the soil like

178
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:08,089
whatever some waste material so that you

179
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,680
necessarily get higher yield but there's

180
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,709
in this experiment there's an

181
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,900
association between those now this is

182
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:16,939
just a tillage experiment so there's no

183
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:20,149
compost applied or manure or anything

184
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:21,769
else just tillage but we're starting to

185
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:25,159
learn that there are these associations

186
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:28,819
so it apparently matters okay now the

187
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:32,810
next slide will show many of these

188
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:35,299
things around in differents so the same

189
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:38,959
graph it's the relationship so this one

190
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:41,809
is the same mister as the previous one

191
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,550
the bars here are the variation in

192
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:44,629
yields and so it was a huge variation

193
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:46,969
from year to year

194
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:49,659
but there was a dry year or wet year in

195
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:53,120
North Carolina they kind of have that

196
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:55,159
and then these are the other indicators

197
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,889
active carbon manganese respiration

198
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:01,549
admissibility postures Megan magnesium

199
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:04,338
and organic matter so and I

200
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:06,919
ranked them right the one with the best

201
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:09,470
correlation was protein the one of that

202
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:12,949
showed before the second best is active

203
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:15,170
Carboni r-squared of 0.85 then manganese

204
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:18,379
and respiration at your stability and

205
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:19,909
organic matter so and these were the

206
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:22,759
indicators that were significant the

207
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:24,730
rest of them were not significant well

208
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:27,230
there's a couple of points here one

209
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,320
organic matter actually had a fairly

210
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:32,690
weak relationship with yield this is

211
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,790
with me Neil by the way while protein an

212
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,220
act of carbon so these kind of new

213
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:40,250
indicators have a much better

214
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,720
correlation with yield alright so that's

215
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,809
pretty significant so we're learning

216
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,870
that it's these labile organic matter

217
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:49,879
compounds in the soil that seem to be

218
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:53,778
more associated with increases in yield

219
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:57,559
and and we see those changes because we

220
00:09:53,778 --> 00:10:01,429
have different toe systems and so Adam

221
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:03,619
gets the book so these three are these

222
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:05,739
biological new biological indicators and

223
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,509
they are the strongest relationship

224
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,320
manganese you might ask why manganese

225
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:14,809
right well manganese is involved in the

226
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,420
decomposition of organic matter it's an

227
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:19,849
electron exchange manganese 2 plus 3

228
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:22,370
plus it's an it's an it's a biochemical

229
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,200
process so basically manganese although

230
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:28,820
it's a chemical indicator it actually is

231
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:32,329
also so a green stability is the first

232
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,829
physical indicator with still a good

233
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:36,109
correlation but of course we know what a

234
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:38,239
magnetic facility is very much related

235
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,579
to these other labile organic matter

236
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,100
contents right and then we have these

237
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:45,769
other ones so this is a very interesting

238
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,690
experiment and we learned a lot one

239
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:49,009
we've we've been able to establish the

240
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,079
relationship between soil health

241
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:53,889
indicators and yield and we've been able

242
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:57,109
to establish that these labile indicate

243
00:10:53,889 --> 00:11:00,620
indicator of labile organic matter seem

244
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:03,379
to be more important than organic the

245
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:07,549
total organic matter very interesting

246
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:10,909
right so here's actually these other

247
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:13,879
r-squared values what you see here was a

248
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:15,230
corn and soybean experiment here are the

249
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:19,340
r-squared values

250
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:21,110
or for the corn yields right then you

251
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,389
see the protein was good respiration

252
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,440
active carbon and manganese right that's

253
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:28,730
the one I reported for soybean yield a

254
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,620
lot of protein is actually quite weak

255
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,909
it's primarily the respiration and the

256
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,039
act of carbon so why is that why is soy

257
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:41,120
bean yield not as strongly related to

258
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,740
protein while corn yield is yeah it's

259
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
the whole because it's a legume and the

260
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,539
nitrogen and all that in protein

261
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,830
contains a lot of an agent so that gives

262
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:51,799
you some confidence that yeah that

263
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:54,830
actually makes sense all right but in

264
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:56,599
this case you see active carbon the mean

265
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:00,379
yields has a correlation coefficient or

266
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,779
0.93 right that's pretty high and it

267
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:05,149
actually was really quite high with the

268
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:07,309
corn as well there's the second highest

269
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:10,579
so active carbon appears to be a really

270
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:13,039
good indicator that correlates with

271
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,250
yield overall protein seems to be very

272
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:24,769
good correlator with yields of probably

273
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:27,500
grasses or non legumes yes that's what

274
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:30,860
we think yes I mean it makes sense right

275
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,139
yeah all right so here's another study

276
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:36,950
and Joseph alluded to it yesterday

277
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:41,389
briefly Wow

278
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:43,940
so we had quite a few samples analyzed a

279
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:45,319
few years ago over 3000 and now we have

280
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,340
a lot more and we'll show some more data

281
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,820
on that and I had a grad student I'll be

282
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,310
fine

283
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,530
and I said well let's make a comparison

284
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:56,059
between these three regions the

285
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:58,699
Northeast the mid-atlantic and the

286
00:12:56,059 --> 00:13:01,129
Midwest so in a portion of Midwest we

287
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:04,060
have a lot of these grassland soils and

288
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:07,879
you know best soils in the world etc and

289
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:10,309
and so we were thinking oh we will just

290
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,169
have great soils there but let's make

291
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:14,599
these measurements of these soil health

292
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:17,949
indicators and then see how the numbers

293
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,200
come out and where where you see the

294
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,940
great box that means that for that

295
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,350
region that was the highest value or the

296
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,940
most favorable value okay so what you

297
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,879
see now let's take

298
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,800
right you see that the Northeast it's

299
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:36,460
about four minute line Achatz little

300
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:38,839
over four Midwest was only three

301
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,480
Midwestern soil on the average had 1%

302
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,889
less organic matter then the then

303
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,560
Searles in the northeast or mid-atlantic

304
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:50,299
and it's basically across-the-board

305
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:54,589
active carbon lowest in the Midwest

306
00:13:50,299 --> 00:14:00,829
protein less than half right

307
00:13:54,590 --> 00:14:03,200
respiration penetration resistance is a

308
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,150
higher number so it's less favorable so

309
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,670
this is really very surprising to us

310
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:09,230
that the source that we regard or the

311
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:11,990
region that we regard as having the best

312
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,940
soils turned out not to be so the

313
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,549
question was well why is this these were

314
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,750
the samples that we got into our lab so

315
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:19,929
we didn't really have a lot of back

316
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:23,029
problem but it seems like on the average

317
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:25,729
because in this region there's so much

318
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,860
export of carbon emissions like what I

319
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:31,220
talked about yesterday well in our

320
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,980
region we have a lot more dairy farms a

321
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,110
lot more organic farms but more

322
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,970
application of manure and compost and

323
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,919
things like that but on the average we

324
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,470
see that our soils actually for the top

325
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:45,979
six inches or actually better and it's

326
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:48,019
the same with the mid-atlantic right so

327
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,210
that's how some of our thinking came

328
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:52,220
about well we have to think about where

329
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,620
the carbon in the nutrients go if you're

330
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,440
in a corn soybean rotation it's row

331
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,000
crops and you export most of the carbon

332
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,570
and nutrients and it goes to China or

333
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,970
Mexico or Europe or place like that that

334
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,129
seems to be having a long-term impact

335
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,529
right so that got our thinking going on

336
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:11,539
this and actually Dave and I have been

337
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:13,669
talking about you know what that means

338
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:15,469
for new york with soil health and maybe

339
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:18,469
getting some of this carbon nutrients

340
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:21,410
from the excess farms like the dairy

341
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,629
farms to some of the other farms right

342
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:26,509
and jeana's gonna kind of talk about how

343
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:29,649
how we can do some of those things okay

344
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:32,629
so that's that was very interesting

345
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:34,159
since then joseph has been and I'm

346
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:36,279
presenting the data here but really he's

347
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,409
done all the work

348
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:41,279
on the credit for that so we now had

349
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:43,569
this is actually now already a year ago

350
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,549
we had a lot of samples from different

351
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,870
places and you can see some of the

352
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:48,519
states in New York of course we have a

353
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:53,110
lot of samples but we also from the

354
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:54,850
Midwest Iowa Indiana we have lots of

355
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,639
sample so even though we don't

356
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,250
necessarily have all the details around

357
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:01,809
you know the farms we have such large

358
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,320
numbers of samples that you can start

359
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:07,629
doing some interesting analyses and like

360
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,360
like I said especially for New York we

361
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:12,279
have you know many many samples that so

362
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,919
we can start doing some work on that and

363
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:18,339
we got some funding from the state of

364
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:20,919
New York that they've leads and so we

365
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:23,620
decided that we were going to do a more

366
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:27,129
in-depth analysis of New York soils and

367
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,019
try to relate that also to the different

368
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:33,789
cropping systems can we see some of that

369
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:36,819
out okay so this is what Joseph did so

370
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:40,719
we have we basically wanted to tease out

371
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,760
sort of a genetic difference in soils so

372
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,420
is it a clay loam versus a silt loam

373
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:49,929
forces along nice and and then the

374
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:51,519
management aspects and and so joseph

375
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:53,649
separated out five different systems

376
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,139
because we could do that based on the

377
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:59,019
crop code that came with the sample

378
00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:00,970
submission so very faster mixed

379
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:05,170
vegetable processing vegetable and

380
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:08,170
annual crop right so processing

381
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,970
vegetable and annual crops tend to be

382
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,100
more conventional systems where a lot of

383
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,980
the carbon and nutrients is harvested

384
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:19,000
and exported off the farm dairy of

385
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,588
course tends to have an excess of carbon

386
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,559
and nutrients because not only do they

387
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:26,049
cycle the crops on the farm nose are

388
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:28,990
they harvest alfalfa and the corn silage

389
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:33,970
they also bring typically feed in from

390
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:35,529
other places last year is a system where

391
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,299
of course you have a lot of cycling of

392
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:40,450
nutrients and carbon and you don't

393
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:43,180
disturb the soil right and then the

394
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:46,390
mixed vegetable is a lot of those cases

395
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:48,070
that tend to be smaller farms typically

396
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,920
organic farms where they grow a lot of

397
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:52,849
crops

398
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,890
typically for farm stands or maybe they

399
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:58,259
sell it in New York City for restaurants

400
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,180
or places like that so and these are

401
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:03,210
typically organic so they use a lot of

402
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:06,269
compost especially compost and cover

403
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:08,250
crops to basically sustain the nutrients

404
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:10,799
and the carbon on their farm so they

405
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:13,289
typically have they they're typically a

406
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,509
scenario where they bring in carbon and

407
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:18,920
nutrients you know from compost from

408
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:21,049
other places okay so let's first see

409
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:25,170
what the differences are between

410
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:27,509
different textual classes right and so

411
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,910
we kind of you know because a lot of the

412
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:32,129
soils are used in kind of medium texture

413
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,440
we just have coarse two types of medium

414
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,050
and then fine and you see that this

415
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,480
organic matter for example for coarse

416
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:41,519
textured soil is only ogress 22.4 and

417
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,589
then it goes all the way up for a fine

418
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,889
Texas twelve to four point four why is

419
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:52,459
that why do fine textured soils have

420
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:55,050
more organic matter or anybody remember

421
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,850
yeah they have these bonds these are the

422
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:58,829
mineral bonds with the organic matter

423
00:18:56,849 --> 00:19:03,149
right so the more clay you have the more

424
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:05,429
potential for for bonding with organic

425
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,470
matter and so it basically kind of seals

426
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,900
in the organic matter so we kind of know

427
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,610
that and that makes sense and we see the

428
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,130
same for active carbon more or less

429
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:17,490
protein and respiration we see that

430
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:19,920
basically as the texture is finer more

431
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,049
more clay you see higher values that's

432
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,570
why we interpret them differently that's

433
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:28,049
what Bob talked about yesterday in after

434
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:31,079
lunch so now let's look at the effects

435
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:33,869
of different cropping systems right and

436
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:35,339
let's start again with organic matter so

437
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:38,479
the processing vegetables have the

438
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:41,699
lowest percentage of organic matter and

439
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,360
then annual crop I'm more or less the

440
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:47,279
same number dairy farms had on the

441
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,250
average higher organic matter there's a

442
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,049
lot of manure that's being recycled and

443
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,230
all that but they also tend to do quite

444
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:57,089
a bit of tillage on these dairy friends

445
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,829
because they have to get the manure in

446
00:19:57,089 --> 00:20:00,779
the ground and all that and mixed

447
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:02,839
vegetables those are the cases where

448
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:07,619
typically they bring compo

449
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:09,480
and then pastors was the highest right

450
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:11,789
and so these numbers so you're you're

451
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,769
talking you know almost you know but is

452
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:17,609
that eighty percent more organic matter

453
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:18,960
in the pastors than in D sorry I'm kind

454
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:21,149
of in the way there then the further

455
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,329
than the then the crops where you

456
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,860
removed most of the carbon and nutrients

457
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:28,589
so how is that for active carbon well

458
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:33,859
more or less similar numbers protein

459
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:36,929
yeah similar respiration okay doubling

460
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:39,029
available water capacity not as much

461
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,820
change you go from one point to two

462
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:44,119
point two five but I missed ability a

463
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:46,200
lot of change you almost triple the

464
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:49,289
stability of the aggregates in a pasture

465
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:54,090
system why is that you have cycling of

466
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:57,539
carbon and and no-tillage right so the

467
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:59,909
two things that that impacts the agnes

468
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:02,490
the most when you tell it it's bad for

469
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:04,320
aggregates and when you don't cycle

470
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,120
carbon it's bad for the aggregates all

471
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,210
right so that's really quite quite

472
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:13,469
interesting so if you see that you know

473
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:15,860
if you say you know somewhat a farmer is

474
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,720
in a say corn soybean rotation your

475
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:22,500
expectation of this of the health of

476
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,319
their soil should be different right and

477
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:32,309
so you can't necessarily so for a dairy

478
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:34,950
farmer if there was a matter for saying

479
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:37,619
oh that's sort of average right but for

480
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:39,509
processing vegetable if they're at four

481
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:44,069
that would be great because they're well

482
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:45,900
above average right so here's another

483
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,339
thing that we looked at and this is a

484
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,769
little bit of a statistical trick it's

485
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,599
called variance component analysis where

486
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:53,940
you basically say how much of the

487
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,730
variance is associated with the inherent

488
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,940
properties the texture how much is

489
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:02,279
associated with the management or the

490
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,430
cropping system right because that would

491
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:08,069
be interesting to know so so this these

492
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,390
numbers add up to a hundred so you're

493
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:12,779
looking at the total variability in the

494
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:15,870
system and for some organic matter about

495
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:16,470
an equal amount of the variation is

496
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:20,729
associated

497
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,900
next year for coffee system right so

498
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,730
that tells you something because when

499
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,130
you for example when we're doing soil

500
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:28,220
mapping you know we're mapping these

501
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,720
inherent we were talking about that this

502
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,419
yesterday morning these inherent soil

503
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,669
properties that we have to consider what

504
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:38,480
kind of a cropping system is that soil

505
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:41,309
in because it's just as important right

506
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,169
about to say for an active carbon I give

507
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:46,558
them a similar color

508
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:48,000
now for these labile organic matter

509
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,250
indicators protein respiration and

510
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,380
higher stability most of the variation

511
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:57,808
was associated with cropping system not

512
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,150
as much the inherent differences in soil

513
00:22:57,808 --> 00:23:03,629
type from texture but more how is that

514
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:05,850
Cyril managed and remember from the

515
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:09,840
North Carolina study these indicators

516
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:12,379
were very strongly related to yield the

517
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:15,298
most of all those other indicators now

518
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:18,659
available water capacity is primarily

519
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:19,798
defined by texture that's the so is the

520
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:22,230
clays the sand

521
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:25,259
yeah maybe how you manage it is not all

522
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,460
that much impacted or doesn't all that

523
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:29,429
much the impact that available water

524
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,579
capacity so the point of this is is

525
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:34,080
maybe to one we're learning a lot about

526
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:38,250
soil health and what impacts our health

527
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:41,428
to is this issue of we have to think of

528
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,619
the anthropogenic impacts on soils from

529
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:46,350
cropping systems as being a very

530
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:48,899
important factor that when we think of a

531
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:50,579
sorta land we look at a soil map at

532
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,309
least a way to survive currently it's we

533
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:56,460
don't have all the information yet

534
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:58,889
because a Honeoye silt loam which is the

535
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,870
state soil for New York on a dairy farm

536
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,909
is not going to be the same as a honey

537
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:05,788
or so long on a kind of grain operation

538
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:09,650
or a mixed vegetable operation okay so

539
00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:13,500
we have to start right it's like saying

540
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:15,000
humans you're you're human but you're

541
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,730
not sort of recognizing the

542
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,829
individuality of each person right so

543
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:25,169
you it's just general so the other thing

544
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:26,939
then that Joseph and I kind of worked on

545
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:29,810
and said well you know one thing maybe

546
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,539
that we can start doing is the set

547
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:35,000
goals called aspirational sort of health

548
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:37,700
goals so if we know what kind of a

549
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,089
cropping system you're in right we can

550
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:44,569
say for example if you're an annual crop

551
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:46,879
that you know you should be able to

552
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:50,119
achieve 3.2 percent organic matter

553
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,780
because that's actually the 75th

554
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:58,189
percentile of the distribution so we can

555
00:24:53,779 --> 00:25:02,269
we can say you know this is a health

556
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:04,220
goal that you can access by them but

557
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:05,900
that health goal will be different for a

558
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,690
cash grain operation than a dairy

559
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,550
operation or a mixed vegetable operation

560
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,470
but we're we're saying if you are below

561
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:15,470
if you're a corn soybean farmer in New

562
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,539
York and you're below 3.2 percent you

563
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,370
can do better

564
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:21,619
we're not saying you should become 5%

565
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:24,799
because that would be unrealistic that

566
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:26,839
may be okay for miss Peck successful

567
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,119
operation but if you are a cash train

568
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,639
operation you should be able to reach

569
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,829
that point right so this is really

570
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,750
important from our perspective because

571
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:38,659
we do the same with water quality and

572
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:41,539
air quality we set these goals we said

573
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,400
you know nitrating ground water right

574
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:45,529
ten parts per million that's the

575
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,019
standard we say if you're above that

576
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:50,119
that's we consider them to be a problem

577
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:53,420
whatever the regulatory implications are

578
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:56,299
so we need to start saying okay if

579
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,620
you're this kind of a farmer and you get

580
00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:01,430
this kind of a sort of Health Report

581
00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:04,009
this is where we think you could be okay

582
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,630
like maybe your potassium level in your

583
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:08,420
blood or cholesterol level you could say

584
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:11,800
you know this is a reasonable point for

585
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:15,500
you to reach okay so that gets is

586
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:16,460
actually to another point and that's you

587
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,009
know there's a lot of interest around

588
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,170
Carbon Farming and actually in New York

589
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:25,490
there's people in Albany and our capital

590
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:26,960
or they're talking about it and so so

591
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,910
we're saying what we're starting to look

592
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,110
at with our data is to say look there

593
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:35,060
are certain soils that that have a very

594
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:37,149
little carbon right now and you may see

595
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:40,129
that as the glass more or less empty

596
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:42,759
right so maybe one of those corn and

597
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:46,059
soybean operations that have

598
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:48,819
maybe let's say 2.7 percent organic

599
00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:50,798
matter you say well you have quite a bit

600
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:53,319
of opportunity to bring out that organic

601
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,929
matter level right so because the

602
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:59,470
storage capacity in the soil is own is

603
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:01,840
mostly on or close to us well this is

604
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,960
maybe more severely graded environment

605
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,699
maybe in Africa or someplace like that

606
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,960
so this is maybe a cash grain farm where

607
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,940
you say yeah there's there's some

608
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,039
organic matter in it but you still have

609
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,200
you can still fill up the glass more so

610
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:17,109
if you want to do carbon farming and you

611
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,679
want to sequester carbon into the soil

612
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:22,990
and and so that we can solve this the

613
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:24,960
greenhouse gas problem then going to a

614
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:27,759
cash wave farm would probably be good

615
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,039
right because if for some reason you can

616
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,169
get compost or manure on it it will stay

617
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:35,440
in the soil but many of the livestock

618
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:38,049
farms they basically already have very

619
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,240
high organic matter levels and there may

620
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:43,058
be exceeding the storage capacity of the

621
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,370
soil the glass is half-full you can put

622
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:47,829
more manure or compost onto the soils

623
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:50,409
but you're gonna lose it because the

624
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:53,099
glass is already full but it's just been

625
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:55,808
the organic matter mostly gonna just be

626
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:57,219
going off as carbon dioxide and the

627
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:59,349
nutrients are just going to accumulate

628
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,839
all right so if you're saying oh we're

629
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:05,079
gonna have a program Carbon Farming here

630
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,789
in New York you should think about you

631
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:10,089
know what kind of soils and cropping

632
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:12,009
system you're in so so that you know

633
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:14,319
that you don't say oh I'm gonna start

634
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:16,480
subsidizing dairy farmers to to do

635
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:18,909
Carbon Farming no because they already

636
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,910
have too much carbon on their glass is

637
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:25,470
already full now focus on these farms or

638
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:29,798
maybe even those farms so so here's

639
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:31,960
dosage analysis of you know we can look

640
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:33,910
at what is the carbon saturation level

641
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,058
for these different five different

642
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:40,840
cropping systems from our Cyril database

643
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:42,548
and so you can see that the annual crops

644
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:45,009
the corn soybean wheat and the

645
00:28:42,548 --> 00:28:47,619
processing regular most of them are well

646
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:52,419
below that saturation point is the glass

647
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:54,189
half-empty scenario so if you were to

648
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:56,840
apply more compost or manure onto the

649
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,460
soils that would be great right because

650
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:01,308
the soils can take it they can store it

651
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:04,009
but you can see that the pastures the

652
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:06,158
mixed vegetables some of those farms

653
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:09,349
already are saturated with carbon and

654
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,690
nutrients typically so we shouldn't be

655
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:13,339
spending money on encouraging those

656
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:16,820
people to do carbon farming because they

657
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:18,649
can't they are already at capacity right

658
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:20,778
in this fight away is the equation that

659
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:23,750
we're using which is sort of the one

660
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:25,700
that most people use so so the ability

661
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,579
of the soil to store carbon is related

662
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:33,500
to the sand to the silt and clay content

663
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:39,439
okay maybe Joseph should I maybe stop or

664
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:42,288
I'm gonna skip this one okay yeah I'm

665
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,730
gonna skip print arrows work I think so

666
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:46,158
one of the things that we also were

667
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,120
interested in is can we make ourselves

668
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,010
better

669
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,398
we've been doing it and we actually had

670
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:54,259
been improving it for many years so one

671
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:55,788
of the things is if he if you develop a

672
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,929
simple sort of health test and Bob

673
00:29:55,788 --> 00:29:59,950
talked about that a little bit yesterday

674
00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:02,149
what are the most informative indicators

675
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,558
right which ones have we just already

676
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:06,349
learned about this morning which were

677
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:08,139
really good indicators like the ones

678
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:10,908
that are related to yield and all that

679
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,309
back to the carbon protein and all that

680
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:20,149
right so so we already have some some

681
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:23,599
ideas also maybe this but you know can

682
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:24,979
we estimate one indicator if we're you

683
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:26,389
know from the other indicators if we're

684
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,700
already measuring the other indicators

685
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:32,059
do we have - can we estimate one from

686
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,798
the other and then also can we use

687
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:38,599
reflectance spectroscopy this is one of

688
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:40,009
Dave's PhD students so what we did is we

689
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:42,349
did what's called the best subsurface

690
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:44,690
analysis we said if you measure only one

691
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:47,119
indicator which one is the most

692
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:51,259
informative and it turned out to be

693
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:52,639
active carbon alright so you can if you

694
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:54,230
look at all the indicators that we

695
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,538
measure and the overall sort of house

696
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:58,370
score did you get from that if you

697
00:30:56,538 --> 00:31:01,158
already measured active carbon you

698
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:03,109
capture 60% of the variability that's

699
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,730
pretty good okay it's only one

700
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:06,889
measurement and it's a really easy

701
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,558
measurement to make you saw it yesterday

702
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,610
pretty cheap like what is it maybe about

703
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:13,670
$1,500

704
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:15,199
equipment maybe $2,000 and you know

705
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,120
pretty pretty quickly done so that's

706
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,590
really good news and we know that there

707
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,019
was a really good correlation with yield

708
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:24,019
as well so it's like that's a real

709
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:27,109
winner right if you say okay I'm willing

710
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:28,609
to measure two indicators active carbon

711
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:31,339
and organic matter would be best

712
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:32,928
Nick you know better prediction if you

713
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:34,849
say I'm willing to measure three

714
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:36,920
indicators active carbon organic matter

715
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:39,740
and respiration so these are all sort of

716
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:42,200
biological indicators labile organic

717
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,779
matter and total organic matter and then

718
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,190
four indicators then aggregate stability

719
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:49,009
comes in to that as well

720
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:51,730
so in a way this is good news if you

721
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:54,319
just want to do a really quick and

722
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:56,120
inexpensive sort of health test you can

723
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,079
measure active carbon and you can

724
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:59,889
actually get a lot of good information

725
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:03,109
all right so that's kind of good news

726
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:05,750
the other thing that that doors have

727
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:09,769
worked on you know we said have you guys

728
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:11,690
seen the AWC yet or not okay so

729
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:15,079
available water capacity requires these

730
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:19,400
pressure plates and it's about a $50,000

731
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:21,259
investment we had in my lab because I'm

732
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,090
sort of physicist and you have to have

733
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:24,940
that but it's really if you set up a

734
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:27,798
sort of health lot you know and here's

735
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:31,029
$50,000 active carbon is two thousand

736
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:34,700
dollars right so and it's kind of a

737
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:38,058
lengthy procedure it takes what we knew

738
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,340
about a week I think Bob forty and so

739
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:42,889
it's kind of a painting behind kind of

740
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:45,589
you know measurement and we also see

741
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:48,410
that it doesn't seem to relate all that

742
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:53,899
well to cropping systems or management

743
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:55,340
it's mostly defined by texture so random

744
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,030
forest analysis which is a machine

745
00:32:55,339 --> 00:33:01,369
learning methodology and he was able to

746
00:32:58,029 --> 00:33:05,660
predict available what capacity really

747
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:07,308
well with very low variability as long

748
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,950
as we measured these other things send

749
00:33:07,308 --> 00:33:13,369
silt organic matter clay protein

750
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:15,679
respiration etc okay and so the ones

751
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:16,969
that are on top like sand silt and

752
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,480
organic matter and clay

753
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:22,759
and they were the best predictors so we

754
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,400
basically now said look we don't need to

755
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:26,349
measure

756
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,060
available work capacity more we can

757
00:33:26,349 --> 00:33:29,769
basically estimate it from everything

758
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:31,480
else that we measure and we save

759
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:33,519
ourselves a lot of time so we basically

760
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,680
implemented that there's still a few

761
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,079
clients who insist on us using the

762
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,390
pressure plates but for everybody else I

763
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,369
think Bob we now put on the report we

764
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:46,870
say estimated or something like that

765
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:48,819
right yeah so so that was really useful

766
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:52,929
information for us you know it's saving

767
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:56,109
us a lot of money to always have also

768
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:58,570
looked into a grid stability and found

769
00:33:56,109 --> 00:34:01,209
you know maybe somewhat similar result

770
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:04,720
not quite as good and you see that

771
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:06,759
protein aces protein and then organic

772
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,090
matter and clay and in respiration were

773
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:12,699
sort of the the biggest indicators we

774
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:14,169
decided not to estimate aggregate

775
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:16,509
stability we're still actually measuring

776
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:19,960
it with the the rainfall simulator set

777
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:22,480
up okay but you could if you if you say

778
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,220
really wanted to save money and have a

779
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,329
really streamlined sort of health

780
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:33,129
assessment you could actually estimate

781
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:36,099
your stability so this is this is Sonam

782
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:39,610
Sherpa who was a PhD student with Dave

783
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:42,630
here who actually worked with the the

784
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:45,929
Kellogg soil lab in RCS soil lab in

785
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:49,269
Lincoln Nebraska they had a lot of good

786
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:51,070
data using mid-infrared reflectance it's

787
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:53,110
it it's you're not actually doing any

788
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,490
wet chemistry you're just measuring the

789
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:56,740
reflectance properties the light

790
00:34:54,489 --> 00:35:00,519
reflectance properties right so you can

791
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:04,389
like the colors but you go in to

792
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:06,269
actually remain ready and so and it's a

793
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:08,980
very interesting work in terms of

794
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:10,690
comparing the errors that you have with

795
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,179
this technique versus the errors that

796
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,829
you get with laboratory techniques and

797
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:17,469
basically found that especially for

798
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:21,069
carbon and nitrogen and clay content as

799
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:23,259
well you could do just as well doing a

800
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:25,809
very rapid infrared reflectance

801
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,610
measurement as actually measuring it in

802
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:30,369
the lab right so that's another

803
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:34,450
opportunity to speed up the assessment

804
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:36,730
so very interesting all right and I

805
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:38,588
think then that's that's it so a couple

806
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:41,949
of conclusions

807
00:35:38,588 --> 00:35:44,769
overall maybe so one thing I really want

808
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:47,078
to I don't want you to take away is that

809
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:50,349
these anthropogenic spatial processes

810
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:51,519
whether we bring in manure compost from

811
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:54,309
one place to another

812
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,829
or whether we export you know grain from

813
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:59,679
a corn soybean operation out of China or

814
00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:03,220
Mexico that actually does have an impact

815
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:06,129
on sort of health so and we've now

816
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:07,919
learned a lot about you know by by doing

817
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,789
these measurements and especially using

818
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,619
experiments we're really getting a lot

819
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:13,079
of insights in terms of what's important

820
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:18,849
it's our house

821
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:21,490
the first set of tools so we we also and

822
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:25,079
this is maybe something a little further

823
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:28,299
out so if we have these differences say

824
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,339
between livestock farms like a dairy

825
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,710
farm in New York and a new cast grain

826
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:34,179
operation on corn and soybeans wheat you

827
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,039
know then that means that those soils

828
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:37,838
are different and then when we start to

829
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:39,730
do agronomic research if we want to

830
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:43,000
learn about what kind of medicine

831
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:44,829
response you get or what kind of tillage

832
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,659
response you get they are different

833
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:48,760
soils we have to start taking that into

834
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:51,848
account you can't necessarily generalize

835
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,240
and say you your research on our

836
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:57,789
research farm here you know near the

837
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:59,979
campus and that never where you'll never

838
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:02,529
received manure and say oh we can really

839
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:05,199
just translate that to a field on a

840
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:07,450
dairy farm or a field on a mixed

841
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,358
vegetable operation that receives a lot

842
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:12,779
of compost right so we have to start to

843
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:31,509
become a little bit more nuanced about

844
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:36,690
the type of research that we do okay my

845
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:36,690
question is this is just this

846
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:47,108
environment effect and we encourage of

847
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:49,440
precipitations another day on the soil

848
00:37:47,108 --> 00:37:49,440
health

849
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:57,019
so questions what what sort of

850
00:37:53,829 --> 00:38:00,079
environmental circumstances impacts oral

851
00:37:57,018 --> 00:38:04,429
health that's it's it's a good question

852
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:07,130
so we have this you know sort of health

853
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:10,940
differences due to climate through the

854
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:13,099
vegetation due to topography where on

855
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:18,190
the landscape er are you in a confluence

856
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:21,349
own are you you know on a hillside

857
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:24,920
temperature force makes a big difference

858
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:28,039
parent material so in this area here of

859
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,960
course we had a lot of we had glaciation

860
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,028
also an upstate New York and we had a

861
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,759
lot of you know impact from that in

862
00:38:32,028 --> 00:38:37,518
terms of the minerals in the soil so

863
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:40,969
those are and we call it corpse right

864
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:42,939
climate landscape position or organisms

865
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:44,959
you know what kind of vegetation

866
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:48,980
precipitation and temperature something

867
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,929
like that so that's that's that defines

868
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,358
the initial qualities are the natural

869
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:56,379
quality of the soil and now we basically

870
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:59,900
see that under agricultural development

871
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:03,950
that additional factor comes in if

872
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:06,048
you're on a livestock operation you tend

873
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:08,358
to maintain or maybe even go up a little

874
00:39:06,048 --> 00:39:10,489
bit but if you're in a cash grain

875
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:13,028
operation and row crop production you're

876
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:16,518
going to go down so it's this complex

877
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:18,079
interaction but it does mean that you

878
00:39:16,518 --> 00:39:22,429
know if we interpret sort of health data

879
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:24,859
that you know a soil in say Alabama it's

880
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:28,250
not the same as a soil in Iowa to start

881
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:31,460
with right now you could make an Alabama

882
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:34,068
soil better than an Iowa soil but that

883
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,960
would be difficult right you can make

884
00:39:34,068 --> 00:39:37,400
them you can really degrade in Iowa soil

885
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,528
and you can make an Alabama so much

886
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,630
better but only average of course the

887
00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:44,380
Alabama soils will be different than say

888
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:44,380
the Iowa soil

889
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:09,429
you know but we're working on that so

890
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:13,000
we're actually we didn't really have

891
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:16,269
enough data to do that so we started out

892
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,980
with you know just one set of scoring

893
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:20,289
functions that we use to interpret the

894
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,929
numbers and then based on this study we

895
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:24,639
said well we need different

896
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:27,250
interpretations for a Midwestern soils

897
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:29,079
than the mid-atlantic and and so in our

898
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:31,449
paper actually those numbers are in

899
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:34,239
there now because we've collected the

900
00:40:31,449 --> 00:40:35,379
samples from all over the country we're

901
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,109
gonna be able to say you know

902
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,960
southeastern soils need this kind of an

903
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:42,490
interpretation northwestern soils need

904
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,940
that kind of an implementation so we're

905
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:48,489
in the process of doing that

906
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:52,510
yeah one thing that NRCS has may be

907
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:56,199
aware of is major land resource area and

908
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:57,220
regions for example a region are up in

909
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:01,419
the Northeast

910
00:40:57,219 --> 00:41:04,269
it covers parts of Northwest and

911
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:07,599
northeast Pennsylvania that rating your

912
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:11,670
innovation and they have similar climate

913
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:14,579
similar soil similar agricultural

914
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:17,980
practices right really that would be a

915
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:20,650
better way I believe to stratify this

916
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:23,949
instead of just you know the state line

917
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:28,180
these oils don't change right so if you

918
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:31,629
use these mlra regions their broader

919
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:35,379
still but yet have similar soils and

920
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:37,240
climates so that would be a way to look

921
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,820
thank you for saying that because we're

922
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:42,669
that's exactly what we're doing right

923
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:47,050
now so we're looking at the EM these

924
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:49,599
major land resource areas or the beyond

925
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:52,390
the llrs dealio Landry so yeah that's

926
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:56,319
the higher higher level yeah actually

927
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:58,900
that's how our soils when we're looking

928
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:03,600
at as a soil science on a major land

929
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:07,210
resource area soil scientists we cover

930
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:10,989
the glaciated Allegheny plateau and then

931
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:12,530
the glaciated Lake Erie Plateau so we're

932
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:16,639
our way the

933
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:19,519
we manage sales now and is based on

934
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:22,400
these mor aims right right so yeah

935
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:33,590
exactly we're completely aligned on that

936
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:40,070
maybe one more quick question yes well

937
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:44,390
we with no leads but less tillage we had

938
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:46,660
higher protein levels right so now keep

939
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:49,549
in mind it's an association it's not a

940
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:51,739
cause we're not saying that it's

941
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:53,539
necessary well I mean we have higher

942
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:55,849
protein levels when we reduce toilets

943
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:59,599
that's all we can say at this point in

944
00:42:55,849 --> 00:43:02,139
time why I don't quite know yet I think

945
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:06,409
I have a pretty good idea because

946
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:08,440
proteins are a very labile important

947
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:12,319
organic matter that is they very easily

948
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:15,470
decompose as opposed to say lignin which

949
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:18,500
is very difficult to decompose so when

950
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:21,199
you till the soil then these these

951
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:23,179
readily decomposable organic materials

952
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,519
are going to be decomposed more quickly

953
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:28,819
right so in a way it makes sense that if

954
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:31,070
you don't tell you protect more of that

955
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:33,650
protein in the soil that's the

956
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,970
hypothesis that we have but you know

957
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:37,400
that would be an interesting thing to

958
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:39,679
study further you know at this point in

959
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,180
time we're just learning so much this

960
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:43,429
thing's that we'd never measured before

961
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:49,389
and then you say like wow that's really

962
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:49,389
interesting ok I endorse it back to you

963
00:43:52,360 --> 00:44:01,240
this has been a production of Cornell

964
