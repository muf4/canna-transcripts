um greetings everybody uh we are this is

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:17,759
the recorded version of the equipment

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:19,618
webinar for the beginning Farmers 120 uh

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,140
if you are listening to it that means

8
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,600

for a little more than eight years

23
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:08,640
um he is the person that we Crystal and

24
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,640
I turn to all the time for

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,299
information about equipment he's also a

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,118
specialist with Vine crops and potatoes

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,360
and he has his own small farm

28
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:24,420
so I'm going to just let Chuck take it

29
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,259
from here and I really appreciate his

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,259
effort on this

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,880
thank you Laura I appreciate it thanks

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,259
for having me on the webinar tonight

33
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:36,839
sorry that I could not be with you live

34
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,859
but as Laura said my wife and I are

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:46,379
expecting our first child uh at any

36
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:47,340
moment now so I had a a pre-existing uh

37
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:50,339
I guess

38
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,380
thing to get to so anyway uh Crystal and

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,500
Laura asked me to kind of go over some

40
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:58,938
of the basics on what a beginning or

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,519
small farmer might need for equipment

42
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:06,658
and as you can see equipment comes in

43
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:08,159
all shapes and sizes and colors and I

44
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,659
just wanted to take a little bit of time

45
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,780
tonight to just go through some of the

46
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:14,818
things that I think are important when

47
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,818
you start to look at purchasing

48
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:19,500
equipment and whatnot so we're just

49
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:21,719
gonna

50
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,900
started here

51
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,280
so where do we start I think the first

52
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,700
question that we all have to ask

53
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,039
ourselves is

54
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:34,079
what kind of scale are we looking at to

55
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:37,620
farm are you going to be a half acre

56
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,840
five acres you know 25 acres it all

57
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,239
makes a difference

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,598
especially as you start to increase your

59
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,039
acreage your your equipment needs are

60
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,439
going to change and it's meant mostly

61
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,179
for an efficiency Factor

62
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,098
um you know where

63
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,420
that's just for example and we'll talk

64
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:56,219
about this in a little bit but you know

65
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:59,399
a two bottom plow worked great for two

66
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:01,318
acres it may not work as well for five

67
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,120
acres it just takes you so much longer

68
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:04,919
to so you may need to go to a four

69
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,539
bottom

70
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,238
I think the other thing we have to ask

71
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,699
ourselves is how much labor do you have

72
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,939
and not only how much labor or time do

73
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:18,899
you have but also what quality

74
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:21,900
do you have uh if you have

75
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,819
you know in my case I have a an ant

76
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,680
that's 83 years old that you know Works

77
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:27,419
quite a bit with me but

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,580
um obviously she can't do as much as

79
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,079
let's say a 33 year old so I think you

80
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,659
have to kind of keep that in mind as

81
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,920
well

82
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:39,719
uh you know

83
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:41,759
back to that scale of size do you have a

84
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,799
lot of hand labor crops you know things

85
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,899
like greens that that may take a little

86
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,180
bit longer or you're going to rely on

87
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,239
more mechanization more equipment

88
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,060
uh long ago it was drummed into me by my

89
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,099
dad to work smarter and not harder

90
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,739
so again you know if you can mechanize

91
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:01,199
something and it's not going to cost you

92
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,819
an outrageous amount of money why not do

93
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,979
it it just makes your life a lot easier

94
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:06,419
improves your quality of life and it

95
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:08,039
could also improve the quality of your

96
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,539
product as well

97
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,158
uh and then I think you have to ask

98
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,500
yourself what do you already have for

99
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,899
equipment uh you know did you inherit

100
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,579
equipment or are you starting from

101
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:23,600
scratch and if you are in a neighborhood

102
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:27,600
where there's other Farms close to you

103
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,699
what might you be able to hire out or

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,419
you know to have somebody else do for

105
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,419
you

106
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:35,039
and you know things like getting Fields

107
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:36,959
ready for planning and things like that

108
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,600
if you don't have the equipment it might

109
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,599
be as easy for someone to just come and

110
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,120
do it for you and pay them or rent

111
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,620
Machinery from those folks especially if

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,639
you know if they're local enough and

113
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,639
they don't mind doing that

114
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,379
the other thought that I like to think

115
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,460
about is is have a system

116
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,079
um

117
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:00,959
it

118
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,659
it just makes your life a lot easier and

119
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,859
really it's on all ends whether it's

120
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:10,919
preparing ground whether it's planting

121
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,780
if you for for example know that you

122
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,899
want to take this three acre field and

123
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:19,019
break it into three one acre blocks

124
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:21,120
and within those blocks you know how

125
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,399
many beds or how many rows you're going

126
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,500
to have at certain spacing

127
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,719
um this really allows you to make some

128
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,699
decisions about equipment size of

129
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,780
equipment

130
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:36,000
spacing of equipment things like that

131
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:37,198
and I think for me I'm I'm kind of one

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,220
of those guys that likes to learn

133
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,139
visually

134
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,440
and so I put this little kind of this

135
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:47,280
little diagram together

136
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:50,699
you know if this was a a One Hole Field

137
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:53,879
so this whole Big Blue Block is one feel

138
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:56,939
but within those within that one big

139
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:59,819
field you know that you want

140
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,160
to have eight rows in each one of those

141
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,079
blocks

142
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,820
that are

143
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:08,159
or eight beds I guess is the best way to

144
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:10,459
say it so if each one of these black

145
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,639
lines represents a bed

146
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:16,500
that's 48 inches wide and from the

147
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,379
center of this bed to the center of this

148
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,779
bed is exactly eight feet every time

149
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,279
you know exactly how many row feet you

150
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:26,339
have or how many bed feet you have in

151
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,258
that block so that you can

152
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,119
do a lot of things you can you know make

153
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,780
sure that you have the right number of

154
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,699
plants the right uh spacing all of those

155
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:37,500
things can be answered

156
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:40,680
I also like the idea of putting in

157
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,519
permanent driveways between my fields

158
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,918
um

159
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,339
it helps not only just to get product in

160
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:49,019
and out and and field work but

161
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,939
actually it keeps a lot of soil

162
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,038
compaction out of your your actual

163
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,560
fields too because if you can Harvest

164
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,219
from these four rows and bring it to the

165
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,379
driveway and put it on a trailer

166
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:03,419
obviously that is one less tractor pass

167
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:06,000
across that field it puts all the the

168
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:08,639
traffic right in that driveway

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,620
the other thing too that you need to

170
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,680
keep in mind that and this goes back to

171
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:17,220
equipment is if this bed is is

172
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,538
too wide you may not find a tractor that

173
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,759
can go wide enough

174
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:23,818
and for example there are a lot of

175
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,660
tractors will not go any wider the wheel

176
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:29,960
spacing any wider than 60 inches

177
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:33,599
and that that can actually

178
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:35,339
play into a certain bed spacing that you

179
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,038
might not be able to use

180
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:41,579
if you want to go wider than 60 inches

181
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:43,740
then you have to find somebody that can

182
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,339
a good machinist that can actually weld

183
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,340
things for you

184
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:54,060
okay so the the question I think that

185
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,860
probably comes up first is is what size

186
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,079
tractor

187
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,960
um especially for a small farmer

188
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,000
beginning farmer and as I said earlier

189
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,899
they come in all different shapes all

190
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,459
different sizes uh all different colors

191
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:13,279
um I I think that predominantly my my

192
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:16,439
two favorites are probably

193
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:20,239
the John Deere series and also the

194
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:22,319
Kubota series and not that I'm

195
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,360
promoting either one but I just think

196
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,280
that in terms of Versatility I think

197
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,020
they have the widest range of of

198
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,019
tractors that you can select from

199
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:35,579
so there there are there are a couple

200
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,759
thoughts on tractors

201
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,940
um and keep in mind that this is is a

202
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,918
little bit of my opinion in this as well

203
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,360
but most Growers that start off would

204
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,360
probably recommend

205
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,360
well one tractor that can do a lot of

206
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,039
things but two two tractors that are are

207
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,778
very different

208
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,759
um one tractor would be the one that

209
00:08:54,778 --> 00:09:00,360
performs the what we call the manual

210
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:02,458
labor okay so it's a tractor that does a

211
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,320
lot of the plowing and field fitting and

212
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,539
hauls a lot of the heavy implements and

213
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,778
whatnot and the second one is more of

214
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:11,639
the what I call the Finesse tractor so

215
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:13,980
once things are established this might

216
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,139
be used to to cultivate or it might be

217
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,039
used to hill or somewhere along those

218
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,879
lines not every Farm needs two tractors

219
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,500
the other nice thing about having

220
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,778
multiple tractors is that you might be

221
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,519
able to leave uh you know a certain

222
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:28,019
Implement that you use a lot you might

223
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,000
be able to leave right on one tractor

224
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:33,060
for a long time and instead of having to

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,379
take it on and off all the time

226
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:36,299
so

227
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,159
um the utility tractor

228
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:40,379
which is going to be the bigger tractor

229
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,278
or what I call the grunt

230
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,720
um

231
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,879
again you need to know what you're going

232
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,459
to do with it are you going to be mobile

233
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,679
or plowing rototilling are you going to

234
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:51,179
be carrying a disc over it and we'll

235
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,639
talk all about those pieces of

236
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,079
implements here in a few minutes but

237
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,360
I just wanted to give you an idea of

238
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,060
what we're talking about I think in

239
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,620
general you know anybody that's probably

240
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:08,039
an acre to 10 acres we'll do fine with a

241
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,919
35 to 40 horsepower tractor especially

242
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,419
if it's four-wheel drive

243
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,278
and there's a lot of reasons why I like

244
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:17,579
a four-wheel drive tractor as opposed to

245
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:20,220
a two-wheel drive tractor one of the one

246
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,920
is that it takes a lot less horsepower

247
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,820
to do the same job as a two-wheel

248
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,299
tractor

249
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,339
so four-wheel drive tractors just make

250
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:31,559
work a lot easier doesn't take as much

251
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,140
out on that on that tractor if it it's

252
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,719
four wheel compared to two wheel

253
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:39,559
for certain equipment like bed Shapers

254
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,560
and other things you have more control

255
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:45,479
the you're able to actually steer when

256
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,699
you have a Implement on the back rather

257
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,100
than just kind of hoping that you're

258
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,000
going in the right direction

259
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,820
um

260
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,458
and really what it also boils down to is

261
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,740
you need to know what kind of horsepower

262
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:00,018
is needed for those implements that

263
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,639
you're purchasing

264
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:06,060
and you know the the best thing to do is

265
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:08,100
you really need to talk to

266
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,599
if you're buying it from you know a

267
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,240
dealership you talk to the dealership

268
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,278
and and they have all the specs on on

269
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,379
how many horsepower a certain unit takes

270
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:17,879
and if you tell them what tractor they

271
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:20,458
have usually they can find you that

272
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:22,019
Implement to match it if you're looking

273
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,059
to buy it

274
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,759
um used and you're going through a want

275
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:28,439
to digest or something you may still

276
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,700
want to talk to a dealer and just get

277
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,440
his thoughts on whether or not your

278
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,220
tractor can pull that Implement that

279
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,220
you're interested in

280
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:41,220
okay and and the the best example I can

281
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:45,300
give you uh again is

282
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:48,480
if you have a 30 horsepower tractor and

283
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:50,759
you buy a five bottom plow

284
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,860
um you're not going to pull that five

285
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,480
bottom plow with a 30 horsepower tractor

286
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,459
whether it's four-wheel drive or

287
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,379
two-wheel drive it's not going to happen

288
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:00,000
and we'll we're going to go into that

289
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:02,838
here in a minute when I talk about more

290
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,839
board plows

291
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,500
the other thing that I'd like to have on

292
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,519
on one of those tractors is a loader

293
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,500
frame

294
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:15,959
um and you know that's that's for

295
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:19,200
a a bucket loader or a set of pallet

296
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:21,899
Forks either one become very very useful

297
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,660
on any farm and it's even better if it

298
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,120
can be what we call a quick touch bucket

299
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:30,559
or frame

300
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:33,360
where these frames have their own

301
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,518
stands for the most part and you pull

302
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,620
this pin right here and then you can

303
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,078
unhook the hoses and back right off of

304
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,120
the whole loader makes it pretty

305
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,679
convenient and then pull right back in

306
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,100
and hook right back up if you need to

307
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,859
and again these pallet Forks can be very

308
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,420
useful especially if you start doing

309
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,399
some um

310
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:55,679
growing of some Vine crops or other

311
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,019
things like that

312
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,879
um that you can actually just put a

313
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,560
cardboard tub on here with a pallet and

314
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,019
move it right through the field and and

315
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,578
load it onto a wagon or unload it when

316
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,500
you get back to the shop

317
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:09,859
so the pallet Forks come in very very

318
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,860
handy

319
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:18,600
the other thing is with any of this

320
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:20,519
Machinery inevitably it will break down

321
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,100
more than likely it'll break down when

322
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,220
you probably need it at the most

323
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:29,639
um so what I I tell guys is to find a a

324
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:34,079
good local mechanic if you can

325
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:36,360
uh and this goes for especially used

326
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,919
equipment that you purchase so that

327
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,680
there may not be any support there from

328
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,319
a dealer or you just don't know how that

329
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,299
equipment was used and

330
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,980
you know if the if the grower that had

331
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,500
it before you took good care of it you

332
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,700
might not have a problem but more likely

333
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,100
you're going to end up with something

334
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,620
breaking at some point in time and the

335
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,180
other thing is if if that that mechanic

336
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,740
or if you can find somebody else that's

337
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:02,278
a machinist

338
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:04,700
there are certain certain pieces of

339
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:07,559
equipment that may need some tweaking

340
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,500
just to fit your certain operation and

341
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:13,439
if you can find a good machinist early

342
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,519
on in your farming career and a good

343
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,800
mechanic you're going to be a lot

344
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,720
happier because they can really

345
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,359
um

346
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:25,320
Make It or Break It sometimes uh

347
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,720
when it comes to fixing equipment

348
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,940
so I'm gonna just start going over just

349
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,040
a couple Basics uh components of

350
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,959
tractors that that are pretty important

351
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,980
in my opinion

352
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,219
um you're going to hear the term

353
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,459
three-point hitch used an awful lot and

354
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,500
when you're you're talking about smaller

355
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:46,500
acreages most of your equipment is going

356
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,360
to be three-point hitched and what a

357
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,179
three-point hitch is really it's just

358
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,759
primarily used for lifting implements

359
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:55,019
that are pulled behind the tractor

360
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,819
uh

361
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:01,679
there are three main what I call three

362
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:04,379
main pieces okay uh there's these two

363
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,838
lift arms right here

364
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:08,899
okay and then there is this top link

365
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,639
piece right here

366
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:15,419
and if you're you if you purchase an

367
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:18,180
older tractor you may be required to add

368
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:20,360
something called sway bars or stabilizer

369
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:23,759
bars as they're sometimes called

370
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,500
which again they they

371
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,778
predominantly mount underneath right

372
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,519
here

373
00:15:26,778 --> 00:15:31,799
and and are the same length as your lift

374
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,139
arm but it just keeps the

375
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,659
uh two lift arms from from wanting to

376
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:40,500
separate and wobble for the most part

377
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:42,179
a lot of the newer tractors have this

378
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,419
turnbuckle system

379
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:48,299
or they have a pin system which is a lot

380
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:52,219
so they don't need a standalone set of

381
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:52,219
sway bars which is kind of nice

382
00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:00,659
um so just a this is a very detailed

383
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:04,679
schematic of all the different

384
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:07,740
components of the of a three-point hitch

385
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:10,138
and I think it's also important that I

386
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,459
point out that there are several

387
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,940
different

388
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:16,799
sizes of three-point hitches uh and this

389
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,579
correlates to

390
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,198
um equipment so something like a small

391
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:23,698
lawn tractor that has a three-point

392
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,278
hitch would be considered a category

393
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:31,919
zero

394
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:35,100
and something that is really large a big

395
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,019
piece of heavy machinery takes a larger

396
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,899
because it's heavier it takes a larger

397
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:43,259
set of arms and what not to lift it has

398
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:46,159
a completely different uh set of pins

399
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:49,139
and whatnot so that it's a lot larger

400
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,439
most of the Machinery that we deal with

401
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,759
Falls between the category one and two

402
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,120
especially if you for for smaller

403
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,120
Growers

404
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:01,979
now so a typical again and and I just

405
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:05,338
wanted to give you another little bit of

406
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,919
a schematic and and how these things fit

407
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:10,500
but

408
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:13,380
this is a brush hog

409
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:17,338
so you have these uh what they call link

410
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:19,140
pins on either side okay of of your

411
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:21,899
three-point hitch implement

412
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,419
and what happens is

413
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,519
these well let me go back to the next

414
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,980
one

415
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:31,879
these arms right here

416
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,200
slip right over those pins

417
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,760
and then you have another what we call a

418
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,038
little linchpin that goes right through

419
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,220
and secures

420
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:43,980
that

421
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:48,120
link pin within that lift arm so it

422
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:51,240
can't slide off okay and then that top

423
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:53,219
link arm slips right in there and you go

424
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,259
ahead and you put a a pin right through

425
00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:00,720
there and lock that in

426
00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:02,160
and what that top link does is it's on a

427
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,019
uh it

428
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,220
it's on threads so it helps you

429
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:11,339
adjust the

430
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,900
pitch so to speak of your Implement so

431
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:15,839
whether you want to tip it forward or

432
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:20,160
backwards it it lets you adjust your um

433
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:22,019
your pitch that way and these draw arms

434
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,380
uh

435
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:27,119
are what really help you raise and lower

436
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,820
that piece of equipment and set your

437
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:33,079
depth for the most part

438
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:33,079
oop going the wrong way

439
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:41,460
one of the things that I really like uh

440
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,740
and they're not very expensive they've

441
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,079
gotten a lot cheaper over over the last

442
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,380
couple years is called a quick hitch

443
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,199
and so this uh piece of machine this

444
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,059
little piece of Machinery right here

445
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,640
hooks on to your three-point hitch

446
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:58,139
okay and it's permanent it stays right

447
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,820
on there so it's hooked right onto your

448
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,179
tractor all the time

449
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:05,759
and what's really nice is that as you go

450
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,019
to hook up a piece of three-point hitch

451
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,079
equipment

452
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:14,940
essentially you just back rate to it you

453
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:17,220
back under it and those link pins fall

454
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,400
right into place there

455
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,798
and your top link you leave a bolt in

456
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,798
the piece of Machinery so your your top

457
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:28,440
link fits right in there and then you

458
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,119
just get in and you you lock these

459
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,259
handles down and it keeps that Implement

460
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:38,038
from from coming off so it's it's it's a

461
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:40,558
really convenient and Safe Way of

462
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:41,579
hooking up a piece of three-point hitch

463
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,339
equipment

464
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,960
I'm going to tell you that it is can be

465
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:49,079
very frustrating sometimes hooking up

466
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,460
three-point hitch implements because no

467
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,319
matter what you do you just can't seem

468
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,880
to get things lined up and you're on and

469
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,839
off that tractor

470
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,179
um

471
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,220
five or six different times sometimes

472
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:01,440
just to finally get that thing lined up

473
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,759
and get it hooked on and what's nice

474
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,640
again about this three-point hitch is

475
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,259
that takes all of that right out of the

476
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,900
equation lets you hook right up back

477
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:12,319
right up get onto it and and take rate

478
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,320
off again

479
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:18,119
so the other piece um especially if

480
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,339
you're going to use a

481
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:23,099
a lot of different Machinery will take

482
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:27,240
what we call a power takeoff or a PTO

483
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:30,000
Shaft or drive and that is what makes

484
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,038
things work it makes makes

485
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,279
rototiller blades go around it makes

486
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:37,019
brush eye blades blades turn

487
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:39,839
makes Baler Motors run the whole nine

488
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:43,259
yards but

489
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:46,619
they are very dangerous

490
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:48,919
this so this is what this is the spline

491
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:53,279
end of your tractor

492
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:55,620
and this is the shaft from your piece of

493
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,079
equipment which slips right over that

494
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:00,719
spline so it looks something like this

495
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,240
right here is your PTO shaft

496
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,380
and then this spins at a pretty high

497
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,140
speed

498
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:11,400
and you have to be very careful when

499
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:13,340
you're working around a PTO that's it's

500
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,519
engaged or running

501
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:20,599
because loose clothing can get caught on

502
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:26,160
this and it can wrap around that shaft

503
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:26,819
and literally spin you right into

504
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,058
um

505
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:33,259
the spin you right into the PTO shaft

506
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:33,259
and you do not want that

507
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,579
so

508
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,500
what we're going to just kind of start

509
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:44,220
from from scratch here we'll talk about

510
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,200
what I call primary tillage or it's the

511
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,538
very first tillage that that you may

512
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,100
have to do to prepare a field and in

513
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:52,440
this case I'm going to refer mostly to

514
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:55,079
what we call moldboard plowing

515
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,720
and again primary tillage is done to

516
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,939
prepare that seed bed or prepare ground

517
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,700
for shaping and trans for transplanting

518
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,519
later on we may want to incorporate

519
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:09,080
residue whether it's crop residue a

520
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:12,298
cover crop or even compost in some cases

521
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:15,119
uh it may be used to help level out a

522
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:17,220
field uh and then also we use it as a

523
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,178
means of disease and insect control as

524
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,860
well

525
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:22,740
so there's a lot of reasons why we do

526
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:24,899
primary tillage

527
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,359
um so you've heard me talk about this a

528
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,100
couple times but this is what we call a

529
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,740
moldboard plow

530
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:34,019
and when we say moldboard this is what

531
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:40,380
we refer to right here as a mole board

532
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:41,879
okay they come in all color shapes sizes

533
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,640
um

534
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,679
and

535
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,340
widths and this is pretty important

536
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:52,980
because depending on on how much of a

537
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:53,759
what we call a swath or

538
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,419
um

539
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:59,220
how wide this this portion is right here

540
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,200
it it's going to vary on how many

541
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,259
horsepower so it takes a lot less

542
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,840
horsepower to pull a 14 inch wide

543
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:10,500
moldboard than it does compared to a 20

544
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:12,298
inch mole board okay again as I said

545
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,940
they come in all shapes and sizes you

546
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:17,099
can get them in from one bottom and this

547
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:21,298
whole thing right here is considered a

548
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:24,599
one bottom or a two bottom which this is

549
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:27,779
or three bottoms all the way up to 20

550
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:29,699
bottoms so there's uh they can get very

551
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:30,538
big

552
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,120
um

553
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:36,019
I tend to recommend sets that have these

554
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:39,298
Trash Wheels or sod cutters

555
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:40,918
it just makes a much cleaner cut when

556
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:44,038
you go into the soil

557
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,280
doesn't it and it lets that in this case

558
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:49,319
over here if you look it lets this sod

559
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,000
roll under really nicely and and get

560
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:54,000
Incorporated

561
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,019
the other thing too is they can come in

562
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,279
manual or automatic resets

563
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:02,639
so as you're going along and if you hit

564
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,918
a big rock these things don't if these

565
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,080
these these mobile boards didn't have

566
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,480
any give to them they would just snap

567
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:12,599
off or they would stall your tractor so

568
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,519
what happens lots of times is that um a

569
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:17,219
manual reset these will just there's a

570
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,538
big spring in here these will come up

571
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,120
uh

572
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:24,440
and then you have to get over whatever

573
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:26,639
it was a rock or hard pan or tree stump

574
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:30,058
you get over it and then you just back

575
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,000
up and it just resets this uh moldboard

576
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:36,720
to where it was supposed to be

577
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,339
the fancier ones uh are and more

578
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,679
expensive ones are these automatic

579
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:43,319
resets where you just don't stop you

580
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,840
these are again two big compression

581
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:47,939
springs the whole thing just kind of

582
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,678
pushes up and then the Springs force it

583
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,140
right back down into the ground

584
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,360
okay where the rest of these are all

585
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,880
manual resets

586
00:24:54,359 --> 00:25:00,119
so just some terminology that you may

587
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,120
hear again

588
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:05,819
that's your moldboard

589
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:08,100
that is your plow point and that's what

590
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:09,779
takes most of the abuse it's very

591
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:10,859
abrasive when you're pulling through

592
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:12,658
that soil

593
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:14,479
here's your side cutter

594
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:17,340
and then on the back side

595
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,620
is something that we call a landslide

596
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:22,558
and there's also a shin what we call a

597
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:26,399
shin there too but it's these landslides

598
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,678
and these plow points that we end up

599
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,240
replacing

600
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,519
depending on how many acres you do and

601
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,019
depending on your soil type but usually

602
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:37,019
they need to be replaced every one or

603
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:37,740
two years if you let these

604
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:40,859
um

605
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:43,019
these shins this upper piece here or you

606
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:44,240
let these landslides or the plow points

607
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:47,940
get wore down

608
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:51,599
then it starts to erode into your mole

609
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:53,460
board and I would much rather pay the

610
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,000
fifteen dollars to replace this little

611
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:59,100
piece here as opposed to the 150 it

612
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,579
costs to replace this big moleboard

613
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,579
piece

614
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:05,819
so just keep that in in the back your

615
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:08,480
mind as we go as you you think about

616
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:08,480
plows

617
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:13,379
it it takes a real knack to learn how to

618
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:14,099
moldboard plow

619
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,520
um

620
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:19,079
it's taken me probably a lot of hours

621
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,940
sitting on the tractor with my father

622
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,918
and my brothers to learn how to how to

623
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,558
move board and some days I'm not even

624
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,140
sure I'm still doing it correctly but

625
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:30,720
um I think it's important

626
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,759
just to to think about again it goes

627
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,940
back to what kind of system or develop a

628
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,740
system for for your fields and I think

629
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,038
the easiest system is to just break

630
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,200
those fields into smaller blocks

631
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,819
um and then plow moldboard plow in One

632
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,080
Direction

633
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:48,839
um

634
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:51,178
and what that does is it it just kind of

635
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:54,119
keeps the field on a on a Level Playing

636
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:56,278
uh over as you keep going

637
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,199
um and again I'm going to tell you that

638
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:00,359
your first pass is your most important

639
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,000
because that sets the tone for the rest

640
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,798
of your passes try to keep it as

641
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,319
straight as possible

642
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,639
because once you get a little cockeyed

643
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:09,899
whether

644
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,240
um

645
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,860
you know yeah yeah don't pay attention

646
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,140
and you start steering away around

647
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:18,058
something or you get off a little bit

648
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,278
once you get crooked it's hard to

649
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:21,839
straighten that pass up until you're all

650
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:25,079
done and then you might be able to clean

651
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,240
it up later with some other tillage

652
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,519
um

653
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,919
and so what happens is

654
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,200
um so this this guy has has made his

655
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,140
first pass on this field

656
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,278
um so he's driving this way coming

657
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,000
towards you

658
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:44,220
and he's flipping soil uh this side so

659
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,700
what he's going to do is he's going to

660
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,620
pick this plow up he is gonna then just

661
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,640
drive all the way back down here with

662
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:52,500
the up

663
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,659
and he's going to put his front tire

664
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,000
right here

665
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:59,580
and he's going to drop that plow in the

666
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,339
ground so he's got one tire his front

667
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:04,678
one front tires in this furrow

668
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:06,000
okay and his other tires up here on the

669
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,679
grass he's going to drop the plow and

670
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,079
then he's just gonna make us next pass

671
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,538
and he's just going to keep making that

672
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,899
until he is all the way over to the

673
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:14,900
other side

674
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,038
so again

675
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:22,038
um

676
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:29,460
this this guy right here you can see

677
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,259
he's going right along and it may not

678
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,679
look like it but his front tire is

679
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:36,179
actually right here in the pass that he

680
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,759
made previously

681
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:40,620
um so he's gonna go right along so that

682
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:44,658
same front tire right there will be

683
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:44,658
right here when he comes back through

684
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:49,079
um now

685
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,600
so over here he threw soil on the side

686
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:53,519
but when he gets over to the end of this

687
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,139
field he's going to have something that

688
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,960
looks like this which we call a dead

689
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,960
furrow and

690
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,220
you really it's it's important and this

691
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,620
is the other reason why I like to plow

692
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,259
one way is that

693
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:09,000
every time you plow whether it's once a

694
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:10,200
year or twice a year

695
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,619
um

696
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,900
move this dead Furrow so if this year

697
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:18,119
the dead furrows on this side

698
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,919
next year you're going to start to plow

699
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:21,778
you're going to actually start on this

700
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,700
side and what happens is it helps fill

701
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:25,619
this in a little bit and leave the dead

702
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,120
Furrow on the other side and then the

703
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:29,939
year after that you're going to reverse

704
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,339
it and just and just keep going back and

705
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,679
forth and that will

706
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:38,038
um keep you from from really making any

707
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:40,880
ditches on either side of your field it

708
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:40,879
keeps it nice and level

709
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,240
so secondary tillage so after you get

710
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:50,460
through and you you go ahead and you

711
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:54,620
moldboard plow I guess I should mention

712
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:57,860
too I'll just go back here real quick

713
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:57,859
excuse me

714
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,480
these moldboards can cost

715
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:05,038
um

716
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,399
they're all over the place depending on

717
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,019
on how War they are how many bottoms

718
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,459
there are

719
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:13,440
um I would say on average you're

720
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:18,419
probably going to end up about 100 to

721
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:21,240
150 dollars a bottom for manual resets

722
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:24,059
and probably more in the range of two

723
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,038
two fifty three hundred dollars for

724
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:29,220
those that are automatic resets

725
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:31,379
so they can be uh they can become quite

726
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,058
costly and again you know depends on

727
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,220
what kind of shape the the whole frame

728
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:38,700
and whatnot is in

729
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:42,000
um so just an idea of what it might cost

730
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,399
you for a mole board

731
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,419
so again secondary secondary tillage as

732
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:46,859
I started

733
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,299
um so once we go through with our mobile

734
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:50,879
boards

735
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:53,099
um we still don't really have

736
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,440
a seed bed that that we could plan into

737
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:57,359
so we come through with some type of

738
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,240
secondary tillage where we break up

739
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:03,119
those clods and clumps level it a little

740
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,798
bit and then and then that allows for

741
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,898
our Cedars and transplanters to move

742
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,298
through or are betters for that matter

743
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:11,099
uh to move through a lot easier and

744
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:12,839
there are lots and lots of tools out

745
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:14,459
there

746
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:15,959
probably the most

747
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,798
um

748
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,940
widely or common uh secondary tillage

749
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:27,298
tool is a is a what we call a disk or

750
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:30,480
disc arrow and again it's just these

751
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:33,480
Round Disc that they as they go through

752
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,919
the soil they chew up and they level out

753
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,360
a little bit and they break up all those

754
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,399
clods

755
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:43,619
uh and what's really nice is that these

756
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:47,099
are they're easy to use they come in a a

757
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:48,538
lot of different widths so you can you

758
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:51,119
know find them anywhere like right here

759
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:53,940
which is about a four footer you know up

760
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:56,639
to this one which is a 14-footer

761
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,740
but just keep in mind that with that

762
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,880
extra width you have to keep increasing

763
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,500
your horsepower every time

764
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:07,080
so you know something like this

765
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,880
three-point hitch one right here you can

766
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,038
pull with as little as you know 30

767
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,679
horsepower without really making the

768
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,119
tractor work

769
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:16,559
whereas this one up here you know you're

770
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:20,579
looking at really a 90 horsepower

771
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:22,460
tractor to pull that comfortably uh the

772
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,778
other thing too is is you get bigger

773
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,120
they no longer become three-point hitch

774
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:28,919
but they become hydraulic so where the

775
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,379
Z2 or three point hitch

776
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,778
so it needs those that lift arms that we

777
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,539
talked about in the back earlier this

778
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:38,880
one does not it actually

779
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:40,500
has a hydraulic cylinder right here

780
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,080
and there's hoses that hook to the back

781
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,500
of your tractor and it actually lifts on

782
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:48,658
these uh this set of wheels right here

783
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,980
but again that's uh you're talking about

784
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:56,460
a much larger piece of machinery

785
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,079
and these disc arrows again price ranges

786
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,319
all over the place depending on if

787
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:04,158
they're new or used and with and what

788
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:04,158
kind of shape they're in

789
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,159
my favorite secondary tillage tool is

790
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:13,200
something called a perfecta Harrow

791
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,500
I think it it pulls a little easier than

792
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,740
disk so it's it's this toolbar and it's

793
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:23,519
got these what we call Danish s times

794
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:25,859
and then these sweeps on on the end of

795
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,798
them so as this goes through the field

796
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:31,439
it it actually kind of starts to fill in

797
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,538
those um

798
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,419
uh

799
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:37,798
voids made by the the discs or made by

800
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,640
the moldboards that you went through

801
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:40,859
with

802
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,038
and breaks up some of the clumps and

803
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:46,019
then this right here is a leveler bar

804
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:47,519
and then this is a rolling Basket in the

805
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,159
back which really helps break up those

806
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,558
clouds and clumps

807
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:54,299
and really just does a super nice job of

808
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,658
preparing a seed bed

809
00:33:54,298 --> 00:34:00,538
and as you see right here anywhere

810
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:04,200
between uh one and a half to three and a

811
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:06,778
half horsepower per s-tine and that it

812
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,240
varies because of um

813
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:12,539
the width of these sweeps that you put

814
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:15,000
on there it takes a lot more horsepower

815
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:17,820
to pull a a three inch wide sweep than

816
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,139
it does just a one inch sweep as you can

817
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,000
imagine

818
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,159
and again what's nice is they come in

819
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,719
varying

820
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,378
widths you can go anywhere from six to

821
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:33,480
thirty six feet to 30 feet wide

822
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:35,098
um and just a very good tool and a tool

823
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,960
that I think at some point in time every

824
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:39,139
Farm

825
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,139
does need

826
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:47,279
another one is are these three-point

827
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:51,118
hitch rototillers and they are fine for

828
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:54,179
growing very fine seeded crops they

829
00:34:51,119 --> 00:35:00,559
prepare a really super fine seed bed

830
00:34:54,179 --> 00:35:00,559
however uh there are some issues

831
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,579
they they can be very slow

832
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,980
uh because if you are into something

833
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:10,440
that's got a lot of sod

834
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,559
um it it may actually take you two or

835
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,780
three passes to get a bed

836
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:17,759
like you want it

837
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,160
um they are not really made to go very

838
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,740
deep so they're really just like a you

839
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,539
know that three inch tillage depth which

840
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:27,118
for some crops is fine but for others

841
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:29,338
they like it a little deeper

842
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,420
they can require a fair amount of

843
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:35,699
horsepower again because you are

844
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,280
you know not using three-point hitch but

845
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:40,098
also the PTO the power takeoff which is

846
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,019
going to draw some extra power

847
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:45,599
and they can be expensive

848
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:47,159
um you know nine 9 900 for a very narrow

849
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,099
one that's probably about a four footer

850
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:53,159
up to three thousand dollars on a six

851
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:55,320
footer and again there are many

852
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:57,960
manufacturers out there

853
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,960
um which is the guy on the bottom

854
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,699
here probably being one of the higher

855
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,900
end

856
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:04,980
rototillers in my opinion one a very

857
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,920
nice unit

858
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,900
the other thing that uh I don't

859
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,800
particularly care for about rototillers

860
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:17,000
is that they pretty much destroy

861
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:20,339
a good chunk of your soil structure

862
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,780
they break this this this soil up so

863
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:24,119
fine

864
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:26,880
um that uh you can run into some

865
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,260
problems with some soil tilt later later

866
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,099
on

867
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:32,460
um

868
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:36,680
but uh I think that's a whole nother

869
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,679
talk discussion for another time

870
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,180
this is a piece of Machinery which I

871
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:44,160
don't expect a lot of new Farmers to

872
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:46,379
have it's grown in popularity the last

873
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:49,618
couple years it's called a Spader

874
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:52,500
and as you can see it's got these what

875
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:53,338
we call while they call them Spader

876
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,059
teeth

877
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:59,578
but they look like giant tines with big

878
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:02,460
sweeps at them or points

879
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,599
and essentially what they do is they

880
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,179
um

881
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,240
They Don't Really till soil but they

882
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:11,578
just kind of mix it up and stir it and

883
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:14,338
then there's there's this kind of this

884
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:16,800
leveler unit here in the back which

885
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:18,480
helps break up some clumps push clumps

886
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,579
down in the ground and also just kind of

887
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,480
give you a little bit of a level

888
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:24,960
um

889
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,539
they again are they're quite slow

890
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,539
because you need to take your time to in

891
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:33,300
order to to get uh enough of those

892
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:36,059
Spader knives to go down into the soil

893
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:39,240
and they are expensive and you need a

894
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:40,559
large horsepower tractor uh to run it

895
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:43,679
comfortably

896
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,539
but if you want to see how these work uh

897
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,399
there's a good website with some good

898
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:50,759
videos right here that you can go ahead

899
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,639
and take a look at and see how those

900
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,880
units work again I think for beginning

901
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:57,719
Farmers this is a little bit of Overkill

902
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,579
um

903
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:01,379
and as I said they had gained popularity

904
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:03,060
but um

905
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,800
there are a couple folks that I know

906
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:06,179
that have them that actually have parked

907
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,920
them

908
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:10,440
um because they were just taking too

909
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,300
much time to prepare their fields with

910
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,000
them

911
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:17,640
the the advantage again is that they are

912
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,039
not as hard on your soil as a rototiller

913
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,139
so they maintain a little bit of your

914
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,179
soil structure for you

915
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:26,639
um and they are actually very good

916
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:30,980
incorporators of organic matter too

917
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:30,980
which is which is kind of convenient

918
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:39,780
again for smaller acreage I love this

919
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:41,879
unit this is a what they call a BCS

920
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,560
tiller

921
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,980
um and they don't even call they they

922
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:49,980
they call these units tractors

923
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,019
um as you can see right here this is the

924
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:55,679
base unit right here

925
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:58,320
and what I love about it uh is the

926
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:00,480
handle and this is what this

927
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,900
is supposed to be depicting but those

928
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,639
handles rotate uh essentially 180

929
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,639
degrees

930
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:11,578
so that you can have either rear mounted

931
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:14,279
equipment attachments or front mounted

932
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:15,240
attachments depending on what it might

933
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,579
be

934
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:21,319
and the price range you know for the

935
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:24,859
versatility of these units is not bad

936
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,859
as you can see

937
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:31,740
the uh the price for these base units

938
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:34,020
and probably one accessory

939
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:35,519
um can vary quite widely is depending on

940
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:37,320
what what you're looking for horsepower

941
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:39,300
wise

942
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,519
and just to show you the versatility of

943
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,800
these units

944
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:46,338
these are just all of the different

945
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:50,760
attachments that they make

946
00:39:46,338 --> 00:39:53,338
for these tractor units and again that

947
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,839
you know things can be rear mounted or

948
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:58,400
front mounted depending on how you

949
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:58,400
swivel the the handles

950
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:03,599
and one other feature that I like about

951
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,960
this unit is this is actually what they

952
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,960
call their power healer attachment

953
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,599
and I think in circumstances where you

954
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,059
guys might have high tunnels or unheated

955
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,400
greenhouses and you want to make some

956
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:18,619
raised beds and you don't want to do it

957
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,500
by hand

958
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:24,960
I think these power healer attachment

959
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,599
units on the BCS tractors could actually

960
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,699
do a very good job so again you know

961
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,820
these are very versatile they'd be great

962
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:34,139
for smaller acreages

963
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:37,099
and especially if you're you're going to

964
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:37,098
have some high tunnels

965
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,118
I think if you're going to be a

966
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:44,460
vegetable or small fruit grower

967
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:46,640
especially vegetables I think you're

968
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,199
gonna you're gonna wanna look at using

969
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:52,319
plastic mulches

970
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,059
and in order to really get the benefit

971
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,780
out of a plastic mulch you're going to

972
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:59,420
want a a really good

973
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,579
bed

974
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:05,039
shaper or actually a mulch layer

975
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:06,720
okay and here's just a couple different

976
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,139
models now these are what we call

977
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:11,118
flatbed mulch layers okay are they

978
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,139
pretty much

979
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,960
just lay

980
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:20,039
that piece of plastic

981
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,019
rate on a level pretty much with the

982
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:25,619
soil surface maybe just a little tiny

983
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:27,900
bit of a bed but for the most part it is

984
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:31,380
um just going to be

985
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,760
right on the soil surface

986
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:38,220
um

987
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:40,740
there this is a buckeye tractor unit uh

988
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:42,838
where is my pointer

989
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:44,879
that's right here so this is one without

990
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:47,460
plastic and here you can see them laying

991
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,220
this nice row of plastic

992
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,480
this green unit right here is a rain

993
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:54,000
flow unit

994
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:57,240
and

995
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,059
four I think the larger operations the

996
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:00,919
rain flow unit is where I would steer

997
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:04,559
you

998
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,780
for a couple acres these Buckeye units

999
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:10,259
really do a nice job and they're they're

1000
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:14,099
a little less expensive

1001
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:17,520
than uh than some of the rain flow

1002
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:19,680
models again rain flow is a company out

1003
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,119
of Pennsylvania that makes a lot of

1004
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,519
different equipment a lot of nice

1005
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,760
vegetable equipment it's it's built well

1006
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:28,619
it's heavy duty and rugged and I highly

1007
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,500
would would recommend you talking to

1008
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,760
those folks if you're interested in some

1009
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,519
of these

1010
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,500
bed shapers

1011
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,960
the other option is you can do it by

1012
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,539
hand however I'm going to tell you that

1013
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:45,720
to get the biggest benefit out of out of

1014
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:48,960
this plastic mulch you want a nice tight

1015
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:52,618
bed as tight as you can get it otherwise

1016
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,139
if it's if it's loose and floppy you

1017
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:57,660
don't you don't get the maximum benefit

1018
00:42:55,139 --> 00:43:00,358
out of a piece of plastic

1019
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:04,338
so but if if it's all you've got for the

1020
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:04,338
first couple years it can be done

1021
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:09,000
this is just another flatbed model this

1022
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,940
is um one made by mechanical

1023
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,818
transplanter company

1024
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:17,519
and again you know all of these models

1025
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:19,920
most of them I should say can come in

1026
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:21,780
various widths anywhere from as you see

1027
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,159
here a three foot wide to a six foot

1028
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,180
wide

1029
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:26,879
um

1030
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:29,759
plastic roll it can accommodate so again

1031
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,220
you can have beds that are you know 28

1032
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,839
inches wide to you know almost almost

1033
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:39,799
five feet depending on on how big you

1034
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:39,799
want your beds to be

1035
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,800
I as you

1036
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:51,660
continue to expand maybe your farm uh I

1037
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,400
really think it it starts to make sense

1038
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:57,299
to look at what we call raised bed

1039
00:43:53,400 --> 00:44:01,139
plastic mulch layers okay and again

1040
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:03,539
um I would steer you to rain flow

1041
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:06,480
um probably they're they're model 2550

1042
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:08,099
is one of their most popular models or

1043
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,599
2600

1044
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:14,880
and these units they look big and they

1045
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:17,818
and fairly aggressive and they are

1046
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,920
so you're looking at um you know

1047
00:44:17,818 --> 00:44:22,460
comfortably probably a 70 horsepower

1048
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,460
tractor

1049
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:28,880
um preferably with four-wheel drive

1050
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:31,618
to really do a good job at at

1051
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,800
using this Machinery so what you see

1052
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:35,940
right here this is what actually gathers

1053
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,980
the soil

1054
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,380
to make the bed

1055
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:43,199
this particular unit is set up to

1056
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:46,380
actually apply a liquid fertilizer

1057
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:48,960
underneath and also drip irrigation tape

1058
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,780
or drip tape

1059
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,539
okay so you can see that you know right

1060
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:59,519
here these units can make anywhere from

1061
00:44:54,539 --> 00:45:02,460
a two inch to a six inch high raised bed

1062
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,420
um and again depending on what

1063
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,740
attachments and accessories that you get

1064
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,680
they can be anywhere from thirty three

1065
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:12,838
hundred to five thousand dollars

1066
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:13,980
um so again something that you're you're

1067
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:16,318
probably going to think about once you

1068
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:19,199
get established and uh and start to

1069
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:22,980
increase your acreage and these raised

1070
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,779
beds are where you really start to gain

1071
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,760
um

1072
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:29,940
some of your production you know your

1073
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:32,700
yield increases earliness

1074
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,619
um and drainage too especially if you're

1075
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:36,539
going to be on heavy heavy soils that

1076
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:38,460
tend to stay wet

1077
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:40,380
um you you may definitely want to think

1078
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,039
about one of these raised bed Shapers at

1079
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,039
some point in time

1080
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,200
once you get everything made you get

1081
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,579
your Fields plowed and fitted and you if

1082
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:52,318
you're using plastic you get your

1083
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:53,579
plastic lid you need to get your plants

1084
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:57,300
planted

1085
00:45:53,579 --> 00:46:01,019
and again I I gotta tell you that rain

1086
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:03,920
flow irrigation makes what we call a

1087
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:07,559
water wheel transplanter

1088
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,539
and what this does essentially is

1089
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:11,519
I've got a better picture of it here in

1090
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:14,519
a second but I'll just explain it these

1091
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,139
two tanks are full of water

1092
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:18,719
um and there is a hose that comes down

1093
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:20,578
into what we call a wheel which has

1094
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,838
these spikes onto it

1095
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:27,240
and as you travel down the field

1096
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:30,239
these spikes roll and they punch holes

1097
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:32,879
in the plastic at whatever spacing you

1098
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:35,159
choose you know the wheels all come in

1099
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,099
different spacing so you choose what

1100
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:39,559
size wheel fits the crop needs for that

1101
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:43,079
particular crop

1102
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:44,699
and as that that little steel Spike goes

1103
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:46,380
into the soil it actually fills it up

1104
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:48,659
with water

1105
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:51,780
and so when you take these plants and

1106
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:54,000
you put them in the hole they are being

1107
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,839
put right into

1108
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,699
um

1109
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:58,699
a transplant hole that's full of water

1110
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:04,500
so here's a this is a different unit

1111
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:07,019
this again is is Buckeye and I Buckeye

1112
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:09,960
makes a great piece of Machinery

1113
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:11,460
um don't don't get me wrong rain flow is

1114
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,500
not the only ones on the market these

1115
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,358
guys do a very nice job and they

1116
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,818
actually do a very nice job for smaller

1117
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:20,219
scale Growers so these pieces of

1118
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:22,318
Machinery from Buckeye are they're heavy

1119
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:22,980
duty but they are not

1120
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:25,019
um

1121
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,240
tremendously overbuilt but they're very

1122
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:29,699
durable and here again this is a good

1123
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:31,679
picture of that water wheel that I just

1124
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:33,899
talked about and you can see these

1125
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:34,919
spikes right here are what makes the

1126
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,599
holes

1127
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,300
and

1128
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:41,039
uh this doesn't have a spike on it but

1129
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,720
underneath this Spike if you were to see

1130
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:45,420
it would be this hole right there which

1131
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:47,279
lets the water Escape into the hole

1132
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,420
so that's a complete water wheel unit

1133
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,079
right there

1134
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:53,240
they also you can also just purchase

1135
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:57,180
from Buckeye

1136
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:59,219
just the dry wheel punch so after your

1137
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:01,019
beds are all made or even in bare soil

1138
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:03,179
they don't have to have plastic on them

1139
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:05,759
you can actually take and run this unit

1140
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:07,259
over and it'll punch the holes into the

1141
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,359
plastic or into your soil at your

1142
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,599
desired spacing and then you come back

1143
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:16,440
through and you can plant it by hand

1144
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:18,660
so again you know pretty economical for

1145
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,940
you know 600 bucks or so to uh to

1146
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:22,078
purchase this unit and the other thing

1147
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,760
too is that this is a pretty nice

1148
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,260
toolbar

1149
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,700
that you can actually hang some other

1150
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:30,079
stuff off of

1151
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:30,078
um later on as well

1152
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:36,539
again um

1153
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,699
mechanical transplanter they also have

1154
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:42,659
their version of a raised bed maker

1155
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:44,960
right here as you can see it's a lot

1156
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:49,139
simpler not as many parts

1157
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:52,500
but and not as heavy but

1158
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:54,659
you need very very light soils for this

1159
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,858
kind of unit to work really well and

1160
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:57,480
that's another reason why I like the

1161
00:48:55,858 --> 00:48:59,400
rain flow units is they work in just

1162
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,760
about every soil type

1163
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,880
and do a very consistent job in in all

1164
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:08,880
those soil types

1165
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,318
mechanical also makes a transplanting

1166
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,460
unit

1167
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:14,219
um

1168
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:17,760
this is a mulch planner or pop planner

1169
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:19,318
model 900 that you see right here uh and

1170
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,280
essentially what happens is as you drive

1171
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:24,960
through this is ground driven

1172
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,599
these spikes that you see right here

1173
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,159
these yellow ones rotate around

1174
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,960
and the guy that's sitting here just

1175
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:32,879
puts the plant right there in that Spike

1176
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,420
and then as it comes around

1177
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:39,260
it pushes into the plastic the the spike

1178
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:42,720
or the cup actually opens up

1179
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:44,700
lets the plan out and then right here

1180
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:47,000
there are what we call pack wheels and

1181
00:49:44,699 --> 00:49:49,500
that pushes the plant into the ground

1182
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,480
this is dry so there's no water or

1183
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,338
anything involved they do make them with

1184
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,780
water attachments

1185
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:56,759
um

1186
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,540
very expensive

1187
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,119
um

1188
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:02,759
lots of moving parts

1189
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:05,160
Nana is forgiving on transplant height

1190
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,680
they have to be just the right those

1191
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:11,399
transplants have to be the right size if

1192
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,659
they're too big what happens is this cup

1193
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,720
actually

1194
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:17,338
that's that little hinge unit right

1195
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:19,559
there will close back onto it before

1196
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:20,880
it's off of the plant and it pulls it

1197
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:21,659
right back out

1198
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,818
um

1199
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:26,279
I see where they actually tear plastic

1200
00:50:23,818 --> 00:50:31,380
more I think and and end up you end up

1201
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:34,079
with more problems later in in later on

1202
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:36,838
um so you know you can find these out

1203
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:39,180
there fairly inexpensive used ones that

1204
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:42,119
are in decent shape and again you know

1205
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:45,719
is a good place to start although

1206
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:48,480
um I think you can buy a water wheel for

1207
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:51,000
probably still less money and and it's

1208
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,780
much more versatile than one of these

1209
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,780
mulch planners

1210
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,319
so we've talked about transplants

1211
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,818
um

1212
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:01,079
probably one of the things you'll do

1213
00:50:59,818 --> 00:51:04,679
first before you do a lot of

1214
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:06,599
transplanting is some direct seeding so

1215
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:09,058
in terms of

1216
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:10,800
direct seeding units for smaller Growers

1217
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:13,319
there's there's a fair amount of them

1218
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:16,079
out there this particular unit right

1219
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:19,800
here is what we call an earth way uh

1220
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:23,818
it's made by the company called earthway

1221
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:26,640
um you really need a a good seed bed so

1222
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:28,980
that the unit pushes easily this is what

1223
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:29,818
we call plate planner so you can see

1224
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:32,460
that

1225
00:51:29,818 --> 00:51:34,679
um there's all these different inserts

1226
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:38,460
that go into this Hopper right here

1227
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:41,159
which determines what what you plant and

1228
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,740
these push seeders are really good for

1229
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:45,659
beans

1230
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:48,000
corn and squash

1231
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:49,739
they are knotted on so on the larger

1232
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,480
sheeted stuff they do a good job but

1233
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:55,799
when you get to the finer seated things

1234
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:58,199
like beets and carrots and lettuces they

1235
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,119
don't do as good a job

1236
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:02,039
you get uh

1237
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:03,660
you get a they're either too thick or

1238
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:06,199
they're they're too far apart it's hard

1239
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:11,118
to fine tune where

1240
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:11,118
you want those seeds to drop

1241
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:18,180
uh cold Planet Junior they have been

1242
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:21,659
around for a very very long time

1243
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:23,940
they are very durable again this is a

1244
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:26,058
hand seeder but you can also purchase

1245
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,338
these units to go on a toolbar

1246
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:30,960
so this is a

1247
00:52:28,338 --> 00:52:33,179
three row bed that that they're planning

1248
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,780
and it could be to lettuce or carrots or

1249
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:39,899
beets they do a much better job

1250
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:42,599
more accurate job than the earth way I

1251
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:44,099
just showed you and they they actually

1252
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:47,039
don't have plates in there there's

1253
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:49,740
actually a little Sizer gauge

1254
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:52,800
um and right on the side there you kind

1255
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:56,219
of dial in what your crop is

1256
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:59,039
and it sets that little trapdoor to let

1257
00:52:56,219 --> 00:53:01,019
just the right amount of seed through so

1258
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:03,779
they do a good job again they're a

1259
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:05,400
little more durable a little they you

1260
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,839
need a good seed bed but probably not as

1261
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,260
good as a seed bed you need for that

1262
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:09,259
Earth way

1263
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:16,618
um as you start to increase uh in the

1264
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:18,859
amount of uh what you want to pay you

1265
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:22,200
know they The Cedars get better

1266
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:25,679
these are what we call Belt seaters and

1267
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:27,960
you can see that uh all these

1268
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:31,500
different belts are all made for

1269
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,400
different size seed different spacings

1270
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,679
um

1271
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,579
they can be Standalone push units like

1272
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:41,639
this or again mounted on a toolbar

1273
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:44,339
they are very precise they're very good

1274
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:46,739
um but again they are fairly expensive

1275
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:48,420
you know fifteen hundred dollars

1276
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:50,219
um

1277
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:52,559
just for the base unit and then you have

1278
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:54,838
to buy all the individual belts as well

1279
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,780
but again you know if you're looking at

1280
00:53:54,838 --> 00:54:00,719
doing a lot of greens a lot of small

1281
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,119
fine seeded things carrots beets onions

1282
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:07,639
direct seeded onions these do a very

1283
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,640
nice job very precise job on those crops

1284
00:54:07,818 --> 00:54:11,519
this is a fairly new Cedar it's only

1285
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:14,480
been on the market for a couple years

1286
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:16,739
it's called a Yang clean Cedar

1287
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,139
again it's sold by mechanical

1288
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:20,939
transplanter company so the same guys

1289
00:54:19,139 --> 00:54:22,500
that made those transplanters I talked

1290
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:25,440
about a few minutes ago

1291
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:27,599
uh it doesn't use plates or belts but

1292
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,880
instead uses this roller design right

1293
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,859
here or right here as you see and what

1294
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,440
happens is that they just take these

1295
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:38,460
rollers they drill them out to the

1296
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:40,559
appropriate seed size and spacing that

1297
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,639
you wish for

1298
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,519
um

1299
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:45,960
and again you know they can be

1300
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:47,039
individual mounted push seaters like

1301
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,400
this

1302
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:51,079
mounted in a gang like that

1303
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,240
um

1304
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:56,640
and you know moderately priced you know

1305
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:58,919
for a single unit push unit

1306
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:02,639
um you know 400 bucks is not bad they

1307
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,200
are fairly accurate and fairly easy to

1308
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:05,940
to change as well and that that's

1309
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:08,098
another key component of some of these

1310
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:10,858
units is how long does it take you to

1311
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:12,300
clean seed out and and switch out if

1312
00:55:10,858 --> 00:55:13,259
you're doing multiple varieties of

1313
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,839
something

1314
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,619
so these do a very good job

1315
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:19,799
um

1316
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:22,260
I know Johnny selected seeds is a is a

1317
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,420
local distributor here of this of these

1318
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:28,020
units so you can find them in your in

1319
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:32,039
the Johnny selected Seed Catalog

1320
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:33,059
I think um these are always pretty neat

1321
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:35,579
um

1322
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:37,559
this is a company out of uh Pennsylvania

1323
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:40,318
that builds this what they call two

1324
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:43,859
different versions of a stand-in plant

1325
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:45,719
um so this is uh

1326
00:55:43,858 --> 00:55:48,179
essentially what you could use for

1327
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:49,739
transplanting uh Peppers

1328
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:52,139
um they have to be fairly small of

1329
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:53,338
course tomatoes eggplant things like

1330
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:55,440
that

1331
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:57,779
um you know not a lot it's just by hand

1332
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,940
it's there's not a lot of moving parts

1333
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,099
you know you slip the plant in

1334
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:04,318
push it into the ground pull the handle

1335
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:05,818
and and pull it out and there's your

1336
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:07,679
transplant right there

1337
00:56:05,818 --> 00:56:10,019
and then they have this planet stick

1338
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,879
which you can use for direct seeded

1339
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:13,739
stuff

1340
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,300
essentially you uh you jab it in the

1341
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:18,838
ground and you drop your seeds in right

1342
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:20,640
in the top and pulled out and um keep

1343
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:22,558
walking right on down the row so it's

1344
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:23,699
inexpensive

1345
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,579
um

1346
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:29,338
and uh and can do quite a bit of work

1347
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:32,640
talk a little tiny bit about um

1348
00:56:29,338 --> 00:56:35,460
some other implements that will probably

1349
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:37,379
be used or could be used especially if

1350
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:39,539
you're thinking about doing a lot of um

1351
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,039
not as much mechanization but a lot of

1352
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:42,300
hand labor

1353
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:44,519
um

1354
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:48,900
and I'm going to tell you I have done an

1355
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:48,900
awful lot of hoeing in my life and

1356
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:54,058
there's a couple units that come in

1357
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:55,920
pretty handy this is um part of a what

1358
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:57,680
we call a wheel hoe and I'll talk a

1359
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,980
little bit about a wheel hoe in a minute

1360
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:04,139
an earlier version was again

1361
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:05,818
Planet Junior used to make they were the

1362
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:08,159
first ones to really come out with this

1363
00:57:05,818 --> 00:57:09,960
type of wheel hoe you won't find this

1364
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:12,058
anymore unless you go to an antique

1365
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,920
place but you will find these new

1366
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:16,260
versions right here

1367
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,119
and then of course there's your hand

1368
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:19,700
hose

1369
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:23,099
stir pose

1370
00:57:19,699 --> 00:57:25,919
sometimes they call these potatoes and a

1371
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:30,440
prong ho and

1372
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,440
of course your old-fashioned Spade hoe

1373
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:36,719
so again talk a little bit about wheel

1374
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:40,079
hose for cultivating uh you know weeding

1375
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:42,118
right here these work well even to do a

1376
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,318
little bit of hilling or if you want to

1377
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:44,838
you know make a Furrow to plant

1378
00:57:43,318 --> 00:57:48,420
something into

1379
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:50,519
these are pretty versatile units

1380
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:53,579
um and again that price range is three

1381
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:55,259
to four hundred dollars and you know you

1382
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:57,300
can get down through some tight places

1383
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:58,859
so if you're putting you know a couple

1384
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,920
beds of something

1385
00:57:58,858 --> 00:58:04,739
a couple rows of of lettuce or carrots

1386
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,180
or something on a on a one bed

1387
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:07,318
um if you space it right you might be

1388
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:09,779
able to get right down through there

1389
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:11,279
with one of these um with a wheel hoe

1390
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,839
with one of these

1391
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,119
um

1392
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:18,679
stir pose right on it do a very good job

1393
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,680
of uh cultivating

1394
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:23,640
I think crop sprayers is something that

1395
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,039
we sometimes Overlook and there's a lot

1396
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:28,500
of a lot of variations if you want to

1397
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:30,539
have the highest quality product whether

1398
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:34,500
it's conventionally grown organically

1399
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:35,759
grown you know there are some some

1400
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:38,880
uh

1401
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,920
pesticides out there that are you know

1402
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,539
things like copper so fungicide which

1403
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,460
has been around for a long time still

1404
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:45,179
does a good job

1405
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,559
um

1406
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:52,159
and just to to be able to improve that

1407
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:54,420
crop quality I think is very important

1408
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:56,519
and there's a lot of versions you can go

1409
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:59,940
very simple with a backpack or handheld

1410
00:58:56,519 --> 00:59:05,639
sprayer like the solo unit right here

1411
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:09,059
or you can get a you know 15 20 gallon

1412
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:11,759
um ATV mounted unit that's got an

1413
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:14,460
electric pump or even Mount this in a in

1414
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,859
the trailer of a small you know pull

1415
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:20,460
behind lawn tractor

1416
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:22,500
or you can as you get bigger and you

1417
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:24,000
need to cover a little more territory a

1418
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,280
little quicker you can go to a

1419
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,798
three-point hitch unit

1420
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,359
um that usually has a PTO driven pump

1421
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,759
but you can also stay with an electric

1422
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:36,420
pump uh and that are anywhere between

1423
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,579
three and 200 gallons and again you know

1424
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,740
the prices range all over the place

1425
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:41,880
90 bucks for this little solo backpack

1426
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:45,959
sprayer

1427
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:46,920
100 150 for the ATV sprayers and then

1428
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,780
um

1429
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,000
you know you can spend

1430
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:53,099
upwards of three four thousand dollars

1431
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,480
on a three-point hitch unit you know a

1432
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:55,680
unit like you see right here in this

1433
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,260
picture is probably going to cost you

1434
00:59:55,679 --> 01:00:00,239
about 450 bucks

1435
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:02,280
um and then uh probably another 80 90

1436
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:03,779
bucks for the PTO pump or an electric

1437
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,760
pump if you decide to go with that

1438
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,260
version

1439
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,319
oh

1440
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:13,200
so you when I talked earlier I talked

1441
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:16,259
about a second tractor

1442
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:17,818
and this is kind of the Finesse tractor

1443
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:20,040
or the the

1444
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:22,199
and these are just a couple models

1445
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:22,739
there's there's a fair amount of

1446
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:24,659
um

1447
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:27,000
models that are out there

1448
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:30,298
all three that you see here are what we

1449
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,838
call off set

1450
01:00:30,298 --> 01:00:35,579
um so you are not looking you're not

1451
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:38,519
seated right in the center of the

1452
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:42,059
tractor but you are actually offset so

1453
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:43,739
that you get a good view of the crop

1454
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:45,059
that you're trying to cultivate so it's

1455
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:48,239
right down there

1456
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:51,298
there's various types of

1457
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:53,578
um cultivators uh all three of these

1458
01:00:51,298 --> 01:00:55,798
happen to be what we call Sweep

1459
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:56,519
cultivators

1460
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:58,519
um

1461
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:02,400
and mounted in all different

1462
01:00:58,519 --> 01:01:05,699
configurations the the key with um that

1463
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,079
second cultivating tractor or any

1464
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:08,219
tractor that you want to use for

1465
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:11,519
cultivating

1466
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:14,459
is the clearance or or the

1467
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:16,259
the amount of space that's between the

1468
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:18,599
belly of the tractor and the crop that

1469
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:19,980
you're trying to cultivate as you can

1470
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:21,838
see these are what these three right

1471
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:25,400
here what we call High clear instructors

1472
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:27,539
so there is a lot of distance between

1473
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:32,519
your crop

1474
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:33,900
and also the belly of your tractor and

1475
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:37,079
and you want that because you don't want

1476
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:38,818
to be really bending that crop over if

1477
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:41,760
you can avoid it

1478
01:01:38,818 --> 01:01:43,318
so again you know these these are our

1479
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,180
older units

1480
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:48,420
um you can find them out there they

1481
01:01:45,179 --> 01:01:52,259
range all over in prices

1482
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:53,519
um you can find a a cub High boy you may

1483
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:56,819
find one

1484
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:58,139
with cultivators for 1500 bucks that's

1485
01:01:56,818 --> 01:02:03,058
in decent shape

1486
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:05,759
up to this 274 diesel unit which you're

1487
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:08,700
looking at you know closer to four

1488
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,540
thousand forty five hundred dollars for

1489
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:12,779
um

1490
01:02:09,539 --> 01:02:15,659
uh but uh they are still out there and

1491
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:18,359
and still available

1492
01:02:15,659 --> 01:02:20,759
this is a little more of a a specialty

1493
01:02:18,358 --> 01:02:22,980
item we tend to see these a lot on

1494
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,880
Organic Farms where

1495
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,039
um

1496
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,200
you know cultivation especially for weed

1497
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:31,139
control is is pretty important and these

1498
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:32,879
are Alice chamber G Series

1499
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:34,739
um

1500
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,619
they are

1501
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:41,519
very they've been around for a very long

1502
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:43,140
time so that uh if you're looking for a

1503
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:44,579
newer version

1504
01:02:43,139 --> 01:02:46,558
um there is a newer version out there

1505
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:49,740
called the stockville

1506
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:51,298
uh and they do make um you know you can

1507
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:53,338
find those those are newer units they

1508
01:02:51,298 --> 01:02:55,199
look very similar to this but of course

1509
01:02:53,338 --> 01:02:59,099
have all the updates of power steering

1510
01:02:55,199 --> 01:03:01,139
and hydraulics uh and whatnot

1511
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:04,200
but you can still find these G units

1512
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:06,420
around again uh very versatile you know

1513
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:10,019
here's one that's set up with cultivator

1514
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:12,000
sweeps two different styles here's a

1515
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:15,900
unit that's been set up for hilling to

1516
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:19,440
make uh probably raised beds or to even

1517
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:20,940
make raised beds to lay plastic on and

1518
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,880
here's a unit that's even been set up

1519
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:24,539
for mobile board plowing

1520
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,838
um

1521
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:30,420
probably the the most

1522
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:33,119
sought after

1523
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:35,639
Implement for this for these G Series

1524
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:38,280
are this what we call a basket weeder

1525
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:38,879
and these are really good for

1526
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,460
um

1527
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:44,400
closely planted rows of things like

1528
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:46,079
lettuce beets carrots things like that

1529
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,240
they do a really nice job they don't

1530
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,980
move a lot of soil but they disturb

1531
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:51,838
enough to uh

1532
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:54,358
to do a good job of cultivating as long

1533
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:57,000
as the weeds are really really tiny

1534
01:03:54,358 --> 01:03:59,098
and that's the key with really any of

1535
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,260
the cultivators that you may see or hear

1536
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:04,079
about is

1537
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:06,420
the weeds need to be small to do to do a

1538
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:09,298
really good job

1539
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:12,000
this is another one um it's based on

1540
01:04:09,298 --> 01:04:13,679
an older implement

1541
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,798
um

1542
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:19,219
but uh they so they've updated it this

1543
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:22,440
is called the Hillside Cultivator

1544
01:04:19,219 --> 01:04:25,379
and these units have become popular in

1545
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:28,200
the last few years because as you can

1546
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:30,720
see here they are able to be used for

1547
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:31,739
cultivating between rows of plastic

1548
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,739
mulch

1549
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:38,399
and these things are their three-point

1550
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:41,159
hitch but they are hydraulic uh

1551
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:44,180
they have two cylinders up here which

1552
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:47,639
allow the operator to actually move

1553
01:04:44,179 --> 01:04:50,219
these units in and out depending on on

1554
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:52,259
how wide they need to go for to get

1555
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:54,358
across that row

1556
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:57,720
so very versatile very

1557
01:04:54,358 --> 01:05:00,719
um very useful not only for you know

1558
01:04:57,719 --> 01:05:02,818
plastic but also for Bare ground crops

1559
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:05,298
too they do a very good job of

1560
01:05:02,818 --> 01:05:05,298
cultivating

1561
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,720
you know something else that um you may

1562
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,460
you may need especially if you are

1563
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:17,480
thinking about having some animals on

1564
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:21,119
your farm or if you're going to be

1565
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:22,380
more on the organic side of things and

1566
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,460
you're going to be needing to spread

1567
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:29,519
compost our manure spreaders

1568
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:31,500
uh and again you know the key here is to

1569
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:33,179
match

1570
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,858
um the size of the Manure Spreader to

1571
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,779
your tractor to make sure that you're

1572
01:05:34,858 --> 01:05:38,639
not going to have a manure spreader

1573
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:41,940
that's way too big when you get it

1574
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:45,179
filled up uh to be able to pull and

1575
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:47,760
here's another example too of

1576
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:50,039
um a tractor having a tractor that's got

1577
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,559
a loader on it so that you can actually

1578
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:54,719
load

1579
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:57,059
these spreaders if you have a you know

1580
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:59,298
bulk load of compost delivered to your

1581
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:59,298
farm

1582
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:04,679
uh this is a drop spreader so we can use

1583
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:07,440
these for lime or fertilizer and they

1584
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:09,659
still make these units uh Market farm

1585
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,539
implements which uh is a website for you

1586
01:06:09,659 --> 01:06:14,338
here at the end makes a lot of these

1587
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:17,338
fertilizer drop units and they're really

1588
01:06:14,338 --> 01:06:19,920
good uh if you only want to fertilize

1589
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:22,679
um you know certain widths of beds for

1590
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:25,159
example they do a pretty good job pretty

1591
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:25,159
accurate

1592
01:06:26,338 --> 01:06:31,318
you know I'm not sure if you call this

1593
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,000
equipment I considered equipment I

1594
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:34,920
consider it a very important piece of

1595
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,480
equipment on your farm and that are

1596
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,760
Harvest containers

1597
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:42,358
if you've spent all your time and a lot

1598
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:44,420
of money to get a crop to harvest

1599
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:44,420
um

1600
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:49,858
I I think you want to maintain that that

1601
01:06:46,739 --> 01:06:54,058
quality as as far as you can and and

1602
01:06:49,858 --> 01:06:57,000
having uh good harvest containers but

1603
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:59,400
also uh containers that maybe can double

1604
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,798
for for marketing purposes like these

1605
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,660
shallow gray containers right here you

1606
01:07:01,798 --> 01:07:05,400
know for putting um you know a single

1607
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:06,960
layer of tomatoes in especially if

1608
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,338
you're growing some softer heirloom

1609
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,298
types

1610
01:07:08,338 --> 01:07:15,179
um or even these larger gray green units

1611
01:07:12,298 --> 01:07:17,099
these are great for greens especially if

1612
01:07:15,179 --> 01:07:18,779
you've got a harvest and then put them

1613
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:21,420
in the cooler to cool them down they do

1614
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:23,039
a great job but they're durable they're

1615
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:27,480
reusable just as long as you keep them

1616
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:32,780
clean and I think they just help provide

1617
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:32,780
a much higher quality crop in the end

1618
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:41,280
again you know these are that motto of

1619
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:44,098
of work smarter not harder uh and you

1620
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,440
know if if you only have a small you

1621
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:48,720
know Market Garden you know these little

1622
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:51,720
pull hand carts are great they got those

1623
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:53,038
big flotation tires so they move easy

1624
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:54,179
um the ones with sides are great because

1625
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,559
you can put some of those Harvest

1626
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:57,538
containers in there and not have to

1627
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:59,220
worry about them falling out

1628
01:07:57,539 --> 01:08:02,039
um but then also even just having a hand

1629
01:07:59,219 --> 01:08:03,659
truck to move stuff around is very

1630
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:05,700
useful especially if you're going to do

1631
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:08,338
some farmers markets and and you may

1632
01:08:05,699 --> 01:08:10,379
have to walk aways

1633
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:13,500
I think every Farm probably should also

1634
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:14,298
have some kind of

1635
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,880
um

1636
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:18,479
we call I call it a whirly gig spreader

1637
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,980
um

1638
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,979
there's a lot of different names out

1639
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:27,259
there but uh you can use them to spread

1640
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:31,139
fertilizer or cover crops you know or

1641
01:08:27,259 --> 01:08:32,759
in some instances even crop seed we

1642
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,539
actually use a cedar like this right

1643
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:36,000
here

1644
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:39,119
uh to plant turnips uh purple top

1645
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,579
turnips for root harvest in the fall and

1646
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:44,039
again it works pretty well and there's

1647
01:08:41,579 --> 01:08:46,559
all different versions again here's a

1648
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:51,060
pull type but then again you know here's

1649
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,620
a a hand seeder it's a sling type to a

1650
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:55,380
push type so there's there's all

1651
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:56,818
different levels of

1652
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:59,000
um of these spreaders that you can go

1653
01:08:56,819 --> 01:08:59,000
with

1654
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:05,399
you know flame leaders again uh if if

1655
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:08,399
you're growing crops that there are not

1656
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:10,500
a lot of uh herbicides labeled on or if

1657
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:12,420
you're going to be organic

1658
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,920
um having a flame weeder and this is a

1659
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:16,259
homemade unit

1660
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,719
um made by Michael Kilpatrick who's a

1661
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:21,779
grower up in Granville so here's his

1662
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:23,399
here's his little heat shield unit so

1663
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:25,739
all of his flame is coming out of these

1664
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:28,939
four ports right here and then he's got

1665
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:31,858
the propane tank right there on his back

1666
01:09:28,939 --> 01:09:34,318
does a very good job so again you know

1667
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:37,319
he's got this bed ready uh it's probably

1668
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:39,060
been ready for a couple days maybe he's

1669
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:41,759
got some seeds that have germinated some

1670
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:44,940
weed seeds so he's going to go through

1671
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:47,579
um hit it with the flame weeder uh

1672
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:50,399
if he's done it a couple times and maybe

1673
01:09:47,579 --> 01:09:52,380
he'll plant right into it or he may go

1674
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:55,920
through and stir this up a little bit

1675
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:57,659
again and come back through the weed uh

1676
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,279
with the flamer in a couple days just to

1677
01:09:57,659 --> 01:10:00,779
kill any more weeds that may have

1678
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:02,639
started

1679
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:05,099
so just another little

1680
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:08,000
um interesting piece of equipment that

1681
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,000
could be useful

1682
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:12,659
uh you know irrigation

1683
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:15,119
um if you're going to be a vegetable or

1684
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:18,359
small fruit grower you are going to at

1685
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:21,779
some point in time need an irrigation

1686
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:24,899
system whether it is an overhead system

1687
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:27,420
like these two okay

1688
01:10:24,899 --> 01:10:30,000
um where you're pumping it out to a reel

1689
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:32,940
here or if you're using drip irrigation

1690
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,300
you still need a pump to be able to get

1691
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:37,319
the water to those to those lines so

1692
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,360
again

1693
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:41,819
it may not be the very first thing that

1694
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:44,099
you think of but within the within a

1695
01:10:41,819 --> 01:10:45,779
couple years you're really going to need

1696
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:48,199
to think about some type of irrigation

1697
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:48,198
system

1698
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:55,079
so I this is obviously not a complete

1699
01:10:52,738 --> 01:10:57,119
list but this is a list of

1700
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:58,859
um places to look for Machinery that I

1701
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:00,599
often use

1702
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:03,319
um you know I think again I think a good

1703
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:05,760
spot to start might be with a local

1704
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:07,979
agricultural dealer you know like a John

1705
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,840
Deere New Holland or there there's a

1706
01:11:07,979 --> 01:11:10,738
bunch of them out there

1707
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,539
um

1708
01:11:10,738 --> 01:11:14,459
it's a good place to find tractors good

1709
01:11:12,539 --> 01:11:15,979
used tractors too but then also to have

1710
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:18,658
some support there

1711
01:11:15,979 --> 01:11:20,939
in terms of finding you know matching

1712
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:22,379
equipment with your tractor needs and

1713
01:11:20,939 --> 01:11:25,738
whatnot

1714
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:27,779
um want to digest or Craigslist uh could

1715
01:11:25,738 --> 01:11:31,939
be a place to find some machinery

1716
01:11:27,779 --> 01:11:31,939
going to auctions in the fall or spring

1717
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:35,279
there's a publication out there called

1718
01:11:33,899 --> 01:11:38,579
Fastline

1719
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:41,460
which I really like I subscribe to the

1720
01:11:38,579 --> 01:11:42,619
Northeast Regional Edition you can get

1721
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:45,840
it either

1722
01:11:42,619 --> 01:11:47,399
hard copy comes like well depends on if

1723
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,159
you want to pay for it or not

1724
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:53,579
You Can Get It Free and it comes once a

1725
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:55,738
month or you can get it you can pay for

1726
01:11:53,579 --> 01:11:58,559
it and it comes on a weekly but it's

1727
01:11:55,738 --> 01:12:00,859
essentially all the or a lot of the

1728
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:03,600
Agricultural equipment dealers

1729
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:07,198
everywhere from Maine all the way down

1730
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:09,380
to I think Virginia for the north

1731
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:11,639
Northeast Edition anyway

1732
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:14,940
so it could be a good place to at least

1733
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:16,640
locate some dealers maybe in your area

1734
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:19,460
of course there's websites

1735
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:22,260
tractorhouse.com is another good place

1736
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:24,719
wengers is a used equipment dealership

1737
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:27,300
in Pennsylvania they do a nice job good

1738
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:30,119
support same with rotors farm equipment

1739
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:31,800
out of Michigan and then I I mentioned

1740
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:34,500
them once already and that's Market Farm

1741
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:36,719
Company

1742
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,698
and the one that I did not put here

1743
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,859
would be rain flow but I've talked about

1744
01:12:38,698 --> 01:12:42,359
them several times

1745
01:12:40,859 --> 01:12:44,158
um and the other one is Buckeye

1746
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:47,939
equipment company

1747
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:50,279
um especially for those mulch layers or

1748
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:52,019
those transplanters water wheel in

1749
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:54,238
particular

1750
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:56,640
you know other places uh country folks

1751
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:59,419
grower and actually not just to look for

1752
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:01,500
equipment but maybe to get you

1753
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:02,539
accustomed to some of the industry in

1754
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:06,300
your area

1755
01:13:02,539 --> 01:13:09,600
they do a very good job with a diverse

1756
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:11,820
uh agricultural publication

1757
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,380
of course vegetable Growers news is

1758
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:15,059
another good way you can look in the

1759
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:17,460
classified ads for equipment but also

1760
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:19,800
get a good idea of what's going on in

1761
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:21,300
the the world of vegetables and then the

1762
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,219
other thing too is just get to meetings

1763
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,539
and talk to other Growers they're going

1764
01:13:23,219 --> 01:13:27,560
to be one of your best sources of

1765
01:13:24,539 --> 01:13:27,560
information I think

1766
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:33,899
um so again you know we've said this I

1767
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:35,940
think I think we've

1768
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:37,979
gone over this a little bit

1769
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:39,599
but I think you need to really have a

1770
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:43,019
good idea of what scale you want to farm

1771
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:45,360
and then put a system into place to make

1772
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:47,159
your life easier in determining um you

1773
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:49,859
know what what's going to be going in a

1774
01:13:47,158 --> 01:13:51,658
particular field for example

1775
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:55,500
I think you need to think about your

1776
01:13:51,658 --> 01:13:57,658
labor uh and mechanize where you can

1777
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,800
uh when you purchase equipment make sure

1778
01:13:57,658 --> 01:14:01,799
that

1779
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:04,619
it's appropriate for your size operation

1780
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:08,100
and also for your your current tractor

1781
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:10,198
that you have very important

1782
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:12,480
um you know don't don't purchase those

1783
01:14:10,198 --> 01:14:14,339
implements that obviously can't be

1784
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:16,619
handled um by your tractor if they're

1785
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:18,300
just way too big or too small for that

1786
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:19,800
matter and we have seen that happen

1787
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:22,380
where

1788
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,940
um you know you just that for whatever

1789
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:25,739
reason

1790
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:28,379
um it's just a piece of Machinery you

1791
01:14:25,738 --> 01:14:31,259
bought it's too small for your tractor

1792
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:33,119
um so you've got you know Tire hangover

1793
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,140
marks or could be a lot of different

1794
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:36,059
things

1795
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:37,920
and I think more importantly or most

1796
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:40,140
important is don't be afraid to ask

1797
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,699
questions about the equipment you're

1798
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:43,860
thinking of purchasing

1799
01:14:41,698 --> 01:14:45,178
you know though the the dealers

1800
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:47,339
um

1801
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:49,440
in my experience most of them are very

1802
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:50,940
good they know their equipment if they

1803
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:53,879
don't know it they can find out more

1804
01:14:50,939 --> 01:14:55,559
information about it and I I really do

1805
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:58,260
think that a good equipment salesman

1806
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:01,020
will follow through from start to finish

1807
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:03,480
and and even to the degree where if you

1808
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:05,820
buy that Machinery from somewhere else

1809
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:06,599
especially used

1810
01:15:05,819 --> 01:15:08,698
um

1811
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,380
you might be or you should be able to

1812
01:15:08,698 --> 01:15:11,339
still ask him questions

1813
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:13,079
um

1814
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,640
and you know the other thing and we

1815
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:18,238
didn't put it back in here but make sure

1816
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:20,880
you find a good mechanic and a machinist

1817
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:23,819
if you need one uh to to make your life

1818
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,359
a lot easier when it comes to repairs on
