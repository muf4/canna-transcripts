1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,440
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,039
University today thanks everyone I

3
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:15,480
really appreciate the invitation to talk

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:17,480
with you today what I'd like to focus on

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,039
is mitigating Wildlife damage and

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,600
cropping systems and I'll talk about

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,720
some basic principles of wildlife damage

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,400
management whether you're dealing with

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,399
birds or mammals uh I also want to go

10
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,079
through results of a survey uh we did a

11
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:31,439
few years ago to give you a sense of the

12
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,799
magnitude of the impacts that deer and

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,039
other wildlife caus in New York State uh

14
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:38,799
so we'll dive right into it I think

15
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,558
Dennis slate summarized integrated

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,640
Wildlife damage management pretty

17
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,119
clearly at a conference several years

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,079
ago and it comes down to a very simple

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,959
process you can kill them you can scare

20
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,520
them you can put up a barrier or you can

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,280
spray a chemical that may or may not

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,280
work and that's integrated Wildlife

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,120
damage management now we can all go home

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,679
so but it's really you don't have a lot

25
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,280
of options when you're dealing with most

26
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,000
of these Critters and they can cause

27
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,960
significant economic impacts there are

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,040
some keys I've seen over the years in

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,000
multiple species multiple cropping

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,680
system uh that tend to lead to success

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
in an integrated Wildlife Management

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,080
program first most important is timing

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,080
knowing when and where the damage is

34
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,280
going to occur and making sure you get

35
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,599
up your control strategies whatever you

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,960
choose to use out in a timely fashion

37
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,798
before the damage gets too severe once

38
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,759
Wildlife develop a feeding habit it's

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,520
really difficult to break that but if

40
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,519
you can sort of know that hey my

41
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,399
blueberries are starting to get uh

42
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,599
turnning color the sugar contents going

43
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,799
up I better get my netting on now before

44
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,599
those birds start feeding uh you can

45
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,680
have more success diversity is important

46
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,438
you got to know what different tools and

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,118
techniques are out there and sometime

48
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,919
combining tools work sometimes it

49
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,280
doesn't I'll share some data with you

50
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,879
about that persistence is really

51
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,920
important this is not something you do

52
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,039
once and walk away from to be successful

53
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,719
most of the uh tools and techniques we

54
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,239
have require continues often daily

55
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:06,478
attention in some cases to moving things

56
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,758
around filling gas generators to make

57
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,439
sure you've got electrical power uh to

58
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,119
electrical powered unit or making sure

59
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,000
your batteries are up on your solar

60
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,200
powered units and then monitoring you

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,080
got to know what's working when and

62
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,359
where and as what I'm paying for

63
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,480
wildlife control benefiting me is it

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,160
worth it a lot of times particularly

65
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:28,318
some bird data I'll show you uh later on

66
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,159
it probably doesn't pay for what most of

67
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,439
the Growers are doing for bird control

68
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,280
except in certain uh conditions where

69
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:37,159
you've got low crop

70
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,158
yields most Wildlife leaves sign to the

71
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,039
Presidents off often easy to identify

72
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:43,318
who the culprit is like for example you

73
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:47,158
can see the deer tracks up where in the

74
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:49,479
corners or deer damaged uh apple trees

75
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:52,079
or Nursery crops are really easy to

76
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:54,119
identify uh because deer have lower and

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
sizeer an upper hard pallet they don't

78
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,439
have upper and lower sizing like rodents

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,519
so they don't leave a clean bite when

80
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,439
they bite on something they leave this

81
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,360
ragged torn Edge so it's usually pretty

82
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,759
easy to identify deer damage versus

83
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,519
rodent

84
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,359
damage I mentioned the survey uh deer

85
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,120
damage to agriculture in New York state

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,360
I uh partnered with Tommy Brown and Dan

87
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,640
Decker folks with the experiment station

88
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,720
Farm Bureau a few years ago and we

89
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,279
wanted to estimate deer damage by crop

90
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,000
type in region we wanted to look at how

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,560
Growers were using uh DEC deer damage

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,840
permits that are available to help them

93
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,759
alleviate crop damage and we wanted to

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,080
compare what the magnitude of deer

95
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,359
damage is versus other Wildlife damage

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,879
that they're seeing on their Farms

97
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,319
across the state so we used the database

98
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:44,518
uh Farms maintained by EG markets uh New

99
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,438
York egg statistics service and

100
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,640
developed and implemented a male

101
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:52,000
questionnaire uh to

102
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:54,958
3,99 Farms across New York State uh we

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,280
targeted 500 per agricultural region we

104
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,158
ended up with 909 because there weren't

105
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,479
500 Farms on Long Island there were only

106
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,280
4

107
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,919
uh so we hit all the farms on Long

108
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,479
Island our sample pool was

109
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,518
2,497 Farms across the state and uh to

110
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,560
meet our criteria a farm had to have at

111
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,600
least $1,000 in reported sales and we

112
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,358
included all Farms that were not

113
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,639
exclusively like Bees and Honey

114
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,039
aquaculture in other words you had to

115
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,519
have a a field crop growing of some type

116
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,639
that Wildlife like deer could

117
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:31,399
potentially

118
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,439
damage we got a fantastic response rate

119
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:35,679
uh compared to most male surveys

120
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:39,120
nowadays with about a 50% response rate

121
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,478
we got 1927 questionaires return so we

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,399
think we've got really uh good data at

123
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:46,800
least old data what the impacts were uh

124
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,638
we also followed up with a phone call to

125
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,918
100 uh nonrespondents to look at uh did

126
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,400
their damage differ at all from those

127
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,959
50% of people who returned the surveys

128
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:59,719
and we found that by far the

129
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,319
non-respondents had less damage and

130
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:07,479
smaller acreages of farm so uh based on

131
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:09,279
a formula we down uh uh adjusted the raw

132
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:12,038
damage reports by

133
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,119
31.5% that account for the uh

134
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:16,719
non-respondent bias in the survey data

135
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,720
so again these are probably relatively

136
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,680
good statistics given the sample size

137
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,720
that we've

138
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,680
got probably familiar with all the New

139
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,319
York State egg regions in New York state

140
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,959
I'm going to show you a few tables and

141
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,240
so data are broken down by agricultural

142
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,120
region and you'll see there's some

143
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,360
patterns that

144
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,800
emerg terms of total number of farms and

145
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,120
sales again from that pool of

146
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,280
25,500 farms roughly 60% of the Farms

147
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,120
reported values in sales between 10 and

148
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,038
250,000 uh no big surprise there what

149
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,199
was interesting uh you look at the

150
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,800
proportion of farms that reported more

151
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,680
than

152
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,600
$250,000 in sales the highest percentage

153
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,360
by far was on Long Island with one in

154
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,759
five Farms reporting more than 250,000

155
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,520
in sales and the lowest percentage was

156
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,759
in the Southern Tier with only 8% of

157
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,240
farmers reporting more than 250,000

158
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,560
sales and the big farming regions are

159
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,400
Western New York uh Southern Tian

160
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,199
Central New York again no big surprise

161
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:18,918
there we looked at total estimated

162
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,400
damage uh by deer that was reported by

163
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:23,598
The Growers ended up being almost $59

164
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,879
million a year Statewide so we're

165
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:28,199
talking about a fairly substantial

166
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:31,598
economic impact to the the farm industry

167
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:34,800
in New York state by far uh in terms of

168
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:38,038
acreage and reported damage uh 23% of

169
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,079
that total was uh in Grain crops or 13.6

170
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:44,360
million in losses if you look combine Al

171
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,079
alfha and other hay crops you've got

172
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,840
another 24% another $4.5 million in

173
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,359
losses so if you take grain and hay crop

174
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,879
you're looking about half the total

175
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,598
damage in the state come from those

176
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,879
three crops so it's again a significant

177
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:00,399
economic impact for those farmers and

178
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,919
then you can even get down to the

179
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,560
specialty crops things like grapes and

180
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,279
berries are still you know1 to2 million

181
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,079
a year in losses from

182
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,318
Wildlife we look at it regionally break

183
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,800
down the statistics by Far Western New

184
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,000
York has the highest uh amount of damage

185
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,400
with over 20 million and then lower

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,560
Hudson Valley uh Southeastern New York

187
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,318
has the second highest percent loss with

188
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,000
a little over 145 million and again

189
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,240
those are our primary agricultural

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,120
regions in the state with some of the

191
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,199
better quality soils lot lots of farms

192
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,000
lots of uh cropping systems

193
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,680
there trying to relate that back to Deer

194
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,959
density it's a you got to take this a

195
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,800
little bit with a grain of salt but

196
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,079
generally in Western New York where the

197
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,960
highest damage is you see the highest

198
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:50,279
deer take uh a lot of these uh Wildlife

199
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:53,799
Management units are averaging nine to

200
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,279
16 deer taken per uh square mile in the

201
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,800
wildlife management unit so you got very

202
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,359
high deer densities here that overlap

203
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,639
with high crop densities and valuable

204
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,439
crops doesn't hold quite as true in

205
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,360
lower Hudson Valley a little bit lower

206
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,598
Harvest rate but the issue in the lower

207
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,319
Hudson Valley is you've got a lot of

208
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,158
suburban development even though there's

209
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,960
a pile of deer there and there's fair

210
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,519
amount of damage occurring a lot of

211
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,198
those deer aren't accessible to Hunters

212
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,399
because of suburban sprawl and Suburban

213
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,960
development so average deer take per

214
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,318
square mile lower but that doesn't mean

215
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,158
there's necessarily fewer deer there and

216
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,520
then not surprising the lowest deer

217
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:29,719
densities in the state or in the adarac

218
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,399
Eco region and so you tend to see more

219
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,320
lower levels of deer damage in Northern

220
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,918
New York because you're generally there

221
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,640
you're just you know maybe averaging uh

222
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,838
less than 10 deer per square mile in

223
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:43,319
some areas up

224
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,680
there we asked Growers on the survey uh

225
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,120
what species were what are the top three

226
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,199
species on your farm that are

227
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,200
responsible for wildlife damage and how

228
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,560
much is it costing you and 83% of The

229
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,560
Growers across the state listed deer in

230
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,759
their top three species and we

231
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,359
attributed almost half of the total

232
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,958
Wildlife damage damage that occurs

233
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,600
Statewide caused by deer so hence we put

234
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,399
a lot of focus on deer and deer

235
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,920
management in our program 30% of Growers

236
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:13,078
listed turkeys about 15% of the damage

237
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:16,240
was related to turkeys 21% listed geese

238
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:18,639
20 groundhog 15% raccoon so this sort of

239
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,039
The Hit List these are the species that

240
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,639
are responsible for most of the damage

241
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,399
in agricultural situation at list of

242
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,639
turkeys and geese specifically I'll talk

243
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,600
a bit more about birds in general in

244
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:33,000
sort of the second half of the

245
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,680
presentation so what does Department of

246
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,559
Environmental Conservation do they've

247
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,719
got responsibility and Authority for

248
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,838
deer management across New York State

249
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,320
unfortunately most of the laws and

250
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,519
regulations are written for managing

251
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,959
deer at broadscale landscape scale at

252
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,839
the state level or the wildlife

253
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,078
management unit that's Deer tags go tags

254
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,680
are issued based on an estimated number

255
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,799
of deer in a specific Wildlife

256
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,239
Management unit when it gets down to

257
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:02,679
farm level impact there's really only

258
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,440
two things that land owners have

259
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,919
available the deer management assistance

260
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,480
program and deer damage permits and

261
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:11,360
those are designed to be land owner run

262
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,440
programs and I'll talk a bit more about

263
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,680
each of those but uh by far and way most

264
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,279
of the effort in the state is at this

265
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,919
level which really may not help Growers

266
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,639
that are down at the individual property

267
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,159
level we ask Growers well do you allow

268
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,720
hunting on your farm and what type of

269
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,199
hunting do you allow and not no big

270
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,959
surprise 83% of Growers across state do

271
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,000
allow deer hunting on their Farm but uh

272
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,838
2/3 to 3/4 only allow family friends and

273
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,919
neighbors that they know that's been

274
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,480
very consistent in many state surveys

275
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,278
that people don't like strangers on

276
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,480
their property they want somebody that

277
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:47,278
they know and they trust if they're

278
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,000
hunting deer and that may not those

279
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,278
folks may not take enough deer to have

280
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,839
any real impact on crop damage only 30%

281
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:57,120
of farmers allow strangers to hunt uh

282
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,959
for the 177% of Growers that don't

283
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,839
provide any hunting access they cite a

284
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:04,439
problem with liability and past Hunter

285
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,120
Behavior most Farms don't restrict sex

286
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,800
of take of the deer taken and that's a

287
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,720
issue I think we've got for Education if

288
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:13,479
you're going to have impact on crop

289
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,480
damage if you're going to reduce deer

290
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,480
density you really got to harvest a lot

291
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,920
of female deer that's the growth

292
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,560
potential of the herd if you don't take

293
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:23,439
female deer and you just shoot buck that

294
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,799
herd's going to continue to grow because

295
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,639
the the do's are the ones that are

296
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,439
producing The Fawns every year only

297
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:33,320
about 9% of Growers require that some do

298
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,480
be taken on their farm and um opposite

299
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,079
that 6% of Growers only allow bucks

300
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,680
taken they don't want you to shoot do

301
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,078
which doesn't do a thing to help with

302
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:42,919
crop

303
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,719
damage we ask Growers are you aware of

304
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:46,719
the deer management assistance program

305
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,600
DEC has and have you ever used those

306
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,600
type of permits the way the deer

307
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,800
management assistance program works is a

308
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,800
farm land owners uh fill out an

309
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:58,240
application with DEC usually in

310
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:00,759
September and then DEC gives the land

311
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,120
owner additional dough tags antlerless

312
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:05,360
Deer tags for use by hunters on their

313
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,799
Farm during the regular open hunting

314
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,759
season so what they're doing is

315
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,159
encouraging Hunters to come on the farm

316
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,000
take more female deer hopefully reduce

317
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:16,198
population growth and hopefully

318
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,120
consequently deer damage only 31% of

319
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:20,039
Growers who one responded to our survey

320
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,560
were even aware that this program

321
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:26,559
existed and uh but of those that applied

322
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,879
for permits uh on average they got 7 and

323
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,879
a half permits per farm and killed 5.6

324
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,600
deer farm so again those folks that get

325
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,720
the permits do pretty well at filling

326
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,440
them and uh you'll see that Growers feel

327
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,360
that these do help some alleviating

328
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,800
damage the other type of permits what's

329
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,440
called a deer damage permits Growers

330
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:47,599
were more familiar with deer damage

331
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,519
permits 2third a day had heard of them

332
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,759
but only 12% applied for them uh deer

333
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:56,198
damage permits allow for a grower to

334
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:58,198
kill deer usually ant sometimes bucks

335
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:00,198
outside of the normal hunting season so

336
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:02,120
let's say you're a straw bra grower and

337
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:03,639
you've got deer coming in in June that's

338
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,759
just hammering your crop and you're

339
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,480
afraid you're not going to get your crop

340
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:10,198
out of the field you can apply to DEC

341
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,440
for a deer damage permit and shoot those

342
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:14,120
deer during June if you want to or any

343
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,760
any time of the year outside the normal

344
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,278
hunting season also with a damage permit

345
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,559
you can shoot at night you can use

346
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:22,120
lights you can use bait to attract here

347
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,278
to a safe shooting area you can do all

348
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,839
sorts of things that you can't do with

349
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:27,559
hunting that you can get written into a

350
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,560
deer damage permit we have been using

351
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,198
those the last three years here on

352
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:34,719
campus to try to alleviate some of our

353
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:36,679
problems uh 15 what is there

354
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,480
restrictions on allow

355
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:42,919
to uh you've got to be a licensed

356
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,839
Hunter passed a hunter certification

357
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:47,679
course and you have to be at least 21

358
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,600
years old those are the only two things

359
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,919
uh that you have to actually be a farmer

360
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,199
you don't have to be a farmer in fact

361
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,879
sometimes farmers will get the permit

362
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:57,958
you fill out a form of who your

363
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:00,159
designated agents are when you apply for

364
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,838
the permit and you can have non-farmers

365
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,480
hunters friends who are licensed and

366
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,920
meet the requirement come in and

367
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,079
actually do the removal on your farm you

368
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,559
don't have to be the land owner when the

369
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,120
application submitted you list your

370
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:13,239
agents that are going to do the shooting

371
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,600
most Farmers don't have time to do it a

372
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,120
lot don't do it themselves they use

373
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,159
their designated

374
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,240
agents on average again about eight and

375
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,480
a half DPS were obtained per applicant

376
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,360
in seven deer work kill so again most

377
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,240
people are filling these permits if they

378
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,959
apply for them and they feel they do

379
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,799
some good

380
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:35,000
so just sort of the summarize the survey

381
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:36,679
part of this uh deer damaged agriculture

382
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,519
in New York state is really important

383
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:41,399
it's a high economic impact particularly

384
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,159
in Western and Southeastern New York uh

385
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,159
grain and Nursery crops were the two

386
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:48,120
highest but if you had hay in there

387
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:50,919
you've got substantial Forge crop losses

388
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,600
most Growers allow hunting but uh most

389
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:54,198
Growers don't put any restriction on the

390
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,560
sex of deer and I think you know we're

391
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:58,399
talking with with Farm audiences and we

392
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,039
talk about deer damage we got to

393
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,159
encourage those those farm land owners

394
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:05,958
to to take more female deer uh The

395
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:08,159
Growers who used either the dmap or the

396
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:10,559
DDP program

397
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,120
79% of those growers in the survey said

398
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,518
they thought they were at least somewhat

399
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,600
successful in trying to reduce their

400
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,519
agriculture problem will they solve a

401
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,320
problem no they're not going to solve a

402
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,320
problem but it might uh get you through

403
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,519
a cropping season for example if you got

404
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,120
something like strawberry with a fair

405
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,720
very narrow Harvest window uh intensive

406
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,639
use of a deer damage permit for a week

407
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,800
or might get you through that Harvest

408
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,919
period where you can get your crop out

409
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,679
of the

410
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,399
field what do I recommend to Growers if

411
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:40,638
you've got perennial crops and you're in

412
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,720
a high deer damage area things like uh

413
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,720
tree fruits uh Nursery crops uh 8ot High

414
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,519
fencing is the only thing we know really

415
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,720
works well expensive six bucks a linear

416
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,480
foot installed on average so you can

417
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,160
spend thousands of dollars on a deer

418
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,920
proof fence but we know that works if

419
00:15:55,159 --> 00:16:00,958
it's done properly electric fences do

420
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,519
work in some situations I like to go

421
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:06,119
with a baited electric fence on a single

422
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,720
strand of poly tape or polywire get a

423
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,519
good high voltage deer charger something

424
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,879
that's going to put 7 to 10,000 line

425
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,440
volts out over the the line you can

426
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,919
either use the peanut aluminum foil tab

427
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,279
of peanut butter as a c attractant or I

428
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,078
prefer using claw strips with a deer

429
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,799
repellant some type of odor in addition

430
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:26,638
to the electric enhances the

431
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,078
effectiveness of the electric fence the

432
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,360
way the peanut butter works is a deer

433
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:32,719
smells that peanut butter when it

434
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,879
approaches the fence and it touches the

435
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,759
fence for the first time with its nose

436
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,919
or tongue and gets 7,000 bolts through

437
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,440
its nose that's a pretty good negative

438
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:43,000
conditioner they don't fool the fence

439
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,680
again after that happen usually and the

440
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,240
same thing with the repellent they start

441
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,278
to associate that repellent smell with

442
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,519
the electric fence and so sometimes oh

443
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,879
yeah I can smell that I'm not even going

444
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,318
near that thing uh but again the

445
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:58,399
limitation on electric fences is that

446
00:16:55,318 --> 00:17:00,399
they have acreage size limits they tend

447
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,639
to work pretty well for small Fields

448
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,880
small blocks under about 5 Acres inside

449
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,439
uh sometimes 5 to 10 acres are pretty

450
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,079
good but usually above 10 acres inside

451
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,600
deer will figure out that oh yeah I can

452
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,519
jump over that thing and if there's

453
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,879
something good to eat inside they'll

454
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,639
learn that behavior and the electric

455
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,160
fences will fail

456
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,959
eventually I'll talk about a bit about

457
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,279
bird management some general bird

458
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,439
management principle I was part of a

459
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:28,199
collaborative project with Katherine

460
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,440
Lindell from Michigan State University

461
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:34,240
in my grad student Heidi Hendrick we had

462
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,600
a USDA Nea specialy crop research initia

463
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,798
Project funding to look at multi-state

464
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:42,959
impacts of birds on fruit crops uh in

465
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:45,000
several States our partners again we're

466
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,480
Cornell and Michigan State we sort of

467
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,798
led the program and did uh the a lot of

468
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,919
the field work we have partner uh

469
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,400
universities in the Pacific Northwest in

470
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,000
their fruit growing region out there

471
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,880
with Oregon state Washington State and

472
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,839
Trinity Western and uh folks from the

473
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,440
USDA National Wildlife Research Center

474
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:05,119
in Colorado Fort Collins were involved

475
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,320
in some of the survey design and uh uh

476
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:11,079
discussions on on techniques to

477
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,759
use lots of different types of bird

478
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,839
deterrents out there everything from the

479
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:17,038
old scarecrow to the aluminum pie plate

480
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:20,359
you might see in somebody's backyard the

481
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,640
Raptor model scare ey balloons myar tape

482
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:25,119
all these things may or may not do any

483
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,400
good really depends on on your cropping

484
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,199
system but yet Growers depend a lot on

485
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,400
these type of devices to try to reduce

486
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,080
bird damage to

487
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,120
crops basically just sort of a general

488
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,119
rule of thumb my experience with the the

489
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,678
Haw and Al model that they tend not to

490
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,519
work at all I mean they just a given

491
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,000
that the birds really figure out pretty

492
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,558
quickly that these things are plastic

493
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,880
and they're no real

494
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:51,359
danger uh small areas we've seen some

495
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,039
success with bird distress collar

496
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,359
devices uh on small areas on certain

497
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:57,640
crops uh you'll see some of the data

498
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,678
I'll show you in a few minutes they're

499
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:03,799
not particularly encouraging but we uh

500
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,919
occasionally they work the myar flagging

501
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:08,279
in the upper right it's just a highly

502
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,280
reflective flagging that's tended to

503
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,079
work pretty well on some field crop

504
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:14,200
situations particularly with migrating

505
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,798
geese not so much with resident geese

506
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,200
they've sort of figured that out netting

507
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,038
some people consider a permanent fix I

508
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,480
have my question the way netting is done

509
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,519
how well that really works shooting can

510
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,319
be used in limited areas very sight

511
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,200
specific whether you can or can't and

512
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,240
the same thing goes for tra trapping say

513
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,840
starlings around a dairy farm where

514
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,279
they're causing contamination of food

515
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,480
and stuff sometime uh limited trapping

516
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,359
effort can do some

517
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,159
good our project objectives are looking

518
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:45,038
at things that influence an effective

519
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,679
bird damage management strategy and so

520
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,400
we had one uh group in the Pacific

521
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,679
Northwest and at the National Wildlife

522
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,280
Research Center that was looking at

523
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:55,880
economics to try to quantify cost of

524
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,399
bird damage producers consumers and how

525
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,400
it affects Regional economies we're

526
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,919
still sort of in the data analysis and

527
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,720
writing stages on that part we had

528
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,280
another group of social scientists that

529
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,679
was looking at consumer habits and

530
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,240
marketing again those data are still

531
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,519
being analyzed we hope to get a paper

532
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,159
out here on that fairly soon and then we

533
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,798
had a group of us looking at the

534
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,960
biological side of things uh landscape

535
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,558
and Edge effects bird species and

536
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,240
behavior and uh effectivess of different

537
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:25,399
management strategies and the last two

538
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,919
of the things that were farthest Along

539
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,480
on I want to share some data with you

540
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:32,320
today

541
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,558
we ask Growers as part of the uh survey

542
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:37,678
in all those uh states in the New York

543
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:39,319
Michigan and the Pacific Northwest what

544
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,400
works and what does it in your opinion

545
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,960
and you can see very clearly most

546
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,559
Growers feel that the only thing that

547
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,079
really works is netting the claim

548
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:50,759
netting is very to moderately effective

549
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:53,279
about 80% of the time everything else

550
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:56,000
along this access has Effectiveness

551
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,079
rates of 50% or below most Growers have

552
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,798
tried these things over several years

553
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,000
they really realiz well sometimes they

554
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:03,599
work sometimes they don't uh but they

555
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,919
continue to use them so again we wanted

556
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,759
to get some really hard data on how well

557
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,919
these different devices work for scaring

558
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:14,679
Birds we had uh field research sites in

559
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,759
New York 96 uh unique Farms where we

560
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:19,240
collected data in Central and Western

561
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:21,038
New York we did bird damage assessments

562
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,679
looking at percent damage of missing

563
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,798
fruit we looked at edges versus interior

564
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,960
blocks some Growers claim all all the

565
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,278
damag is on the edges well is that true

566
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,079
we took a look at that we did intensive

567
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:34,079
bird surveys to look at what species

568
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,720
were present what's their foraging

569
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,519
behavior and then we had 52 additional

570
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,600
farms in Michigan that did the exact

571
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:42,278
same protocol so we could combine data

572
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:44,759
from New York and Michigan on the same

573
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:46,319
crops same year same time and do

574
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,200
comparison to how things well things

575
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,918
worked in two different

576
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,319
states in terms of damage assessment we

577
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,840
broke each block or field up in the five

578
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:59,319
strata North southeast west edges and

579
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:01,278
then an interior stratum we select Ed

580
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:04,158
for trees or bushes in terms of

581
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:07,119
blueberry 12 randomly selected trees or

582
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,520
bushes per stratum one randomly selected

583
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,119
Branch per tree and then count it all

584
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,918
intact missing or damaged fruit uh and

585
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:17,000
we looked at sweet cherries honey Cris

586
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:21,120
apples

587
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,839
um uh blueberries and P Noir wine grapes

588
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,599
so we did four uh focal crops on grapes

589
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:28,519
because they're on trellises our setup

590
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:30,678
was a little different we had a ran

591
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:34,000
random height and a random position

592
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:36,360
along the vine we pick a a random height

593
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,759
and and position and then we pick the

594
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,199
cluster closest to wherever that random

595
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,919
height position fell out and we count

596
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,240
all the fruit on that cluster again

597
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,360
damage missing

598
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,319
intact additional data we took for each

599
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,119
Farm it's location or there are presence

600
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,759
of telephone wires nearby a lot of

601
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,158
Growers say well it's those darn wires

602
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,960
the birds get up there perch and then

603
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,640
they go down and they steal my crop we

604
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,120
wanted to look through telephone wires

605
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,159
have an impact other bird management

606
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:06,278
techniques surrounding land cover uh

607
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,240
some uh folks say is you know it's that

608
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:09,480
da Farm next door attracts all the

609
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,640
starlings and now they're over here

610
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,038
eating my blueberries well is that true

611
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,679
uh so we've got good data on the land

612
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,000
cover characteristics around that still

613
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,960
being analyzed and look at number of

614
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,759
plants each strata height and any

615
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,360
special additional data or notes we

616
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,919
wanted to take while we're in the field

617
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,119
terms of observations we use

618
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,480
standardized Point counts two observers

619
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:32,558
15 few minutes in the block counting all

620
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,319
the different bird species that they saw

621
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:37,480
we did it both on the interior of the

622
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:39,879
block and the exterior of the block we

623
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,360
did forging observations uh we did

624
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,960
started with stationary where positioned

625
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,038
The Observer where they could see on the

626
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,558
edge and in the block and just watch for

627
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:50,879
an hour what what birds do you see pick

628
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,079
a focal bird follow as long as you can

629
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,159
record all the fruit it touches eats

630
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:57,918
consumes and then we did uh moving

631
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,240
observations where sometimes it's

632
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,720
difficult to see what's going on in a

633
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,558
block particularly with tall cherry

634
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,839
trees and so we had Observer just walk

635
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:07,720
slowly find a focal bird followed as

636
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,439
long as he could uh when that Bird's

637
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,960
gone find the next bird follow it as

638
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,519
long as you could to get focal

639
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,519
observations on who what they're

640
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:16,798
actually eating and

641
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,679
damaging we look at the Sweet Cherry

642
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,599
data uh what really jumps out at you is

643
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,440
the percent fruit loss in both sweet

644
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:27,879
cherries and blueberries was highest in

645
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,798
2012 you guys remember what happened in

646
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,880
2012

647
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:37,000
what's that

648
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,000
NOP what else could affect

649
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,520
it frost yeah late spring Frost 90% of

650
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,839
the Cherry crop Sweet Cherry crop in New

651
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,278
York was lost in Spring 2012 a late

652
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,439
spring Frost and a big chunk of the

653
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:53,038
blueberry crop was lost so one of the

654
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,960
general principles is if you've got L

655
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,879
fruit on there because it's a bad year

656
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,519
for whatever reason drought late freeze

657
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,240
then those of the years you got to pay

658
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,480
attention to bird damage because when

659
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,519
you've got a low crop load the percent

660
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,079
fruit loss goes way up and we saw that

661
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:11,879
in 2012 in more normal cropping years

662
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,158
didn't see a whole lot very little

663
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,399
damage in apples even though apple G

664
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,679
were seeing the birds are eating our

665
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:18,278
fruit the birds are eating our fruit

666
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,798
when we go out there and measure it we

667
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:23,720
don't see a whole lot in fact uh we did

668
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,879
we only did three orchards in 2014 and

669
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,440
saw Zero damage we didn't see an ample

670
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,278
damage by a bird wine grapes tend tend

671
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,600
to be the most consistent you know we're

672
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:36,759
seeing about uh 3 to 4% loss per year in

673
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,678
Pino Noir wine grapes blueberries again

674
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:41,599
in sweet cherries you get good and bad

675
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:44,880
years again depends on the crop

676
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,678
load we looked at again the position uh

677
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,278
to see what Growers are saying is true

678
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,240
the edges get more damage in interior

679
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:55,319
and we definitely don't see that Trend

680
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,278
in any of the crops that looks like

681
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:59,599
inside and outside get damage pretty

682
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:02,200
much the same the only pattern that we

683
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,759
saw was interesting was we saw more

684
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,640
damage on the north and south end of

685
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:09,960
blocks and wine grapes so why would that

686
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,000
happen what's going on in wine grapes

687
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,079
that would increase bird damage on the

688
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,519
North and South

689
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:19,519
ends what's that orientation absolutely

690
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,558
it's the orientation of the trellises

691
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,398
most of The Vineyards are oriented north

692
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:25,200
south parallel to the finger legs

693
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:26,719
because they're on S slope that means

694
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,360
the open end of the roads are on the

695
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,038
north south side that's where you get

696
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:31,798
your most intense bird damage because

697
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:34,000
it's easier for them to get in the road

698
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:37,000
from the north and south end but besides

699
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,480
that we saw no pattern based on position

700
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,398
in the

701
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,120
orchard we looked at distress collar and

702
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:47,519
hot kites uh as an Effy uh WRA Refugee

703
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,839
these are very commonly used by Growers

704
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,519
throughout New York and Michigan uh they

705
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,439
think they do some good so we want to

706
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:57,798
see do they really do any good at all

707
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:01,038
what can we measure so we uh group uh uh

708
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:03,200
Farm into four clusters of four so in

709
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,519
that cluster of four you'd have a a

710
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,480
block say a sweet cherry block with a

711
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,639
distress collar a sweet cherry block

712
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,440
with a Haw heite a sweet cherry block

713
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,278
with both devices in the field and then

714
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:18,200
a control block and uh our criteria is

715
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:20,640
all those Farms had to be within 30

716
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,840
miles so in the same population of birds

717
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,720
because the birds are very mobile we

718
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:26,480
selected Farms based on the previous

719
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,079
year's damage so we tried to pick farms

720
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,159
to had about the same percent off and

721
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:34,038
similar block

722
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,278
sizes we set up the devices two to 3

723
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:38,720
weeks before Harvest and we position

724
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:41,038
them at least four rows into the block

725
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,278
and if we had both deterrents on a on a

726
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,599
block we set them up on opposite sides

727
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,159
from each other and so then we actually

728
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,359
collected data to see how well these

729
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,200
things worked we move also moved them

730
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,158
once a week some people say moving a

731
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,519
device adds an element a surprise and

732
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,600
increases Effectiveness so we switch

733
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:01,000
positions of devices once weekly

734
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:03,359
and what we found was uh these things

735
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,278
didn't make a bit of difference it was

736
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:09,798
unfortunate and in fact the damage was

737
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:11,839
highest where we Ed both devices so

738
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:13,599
again Growers think these things work

739
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,599
but they are wasting a lot of time and

740
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,959
money if you look at the control block

741
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:21,879
except for this one uh unusual uh New

742
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,360
York Farm actually the controls suffered

743
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,799
slightly less damage than the treated

744
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:28,639
blocks and uh there was no significant

745
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:31,158
difference uh when we did the stats test

746
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,320
across there it just made no difference

747
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:35,080
whatsoever putting these things up in in

748
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:37,558
uh sweet

749
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:39,359
cherries we also came across the idea of

750
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:41,119
using air dancers and you might have

751
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,158
seen these at the used car lots these

752
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,278
sort of silky things that are air

753
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,159
powered and wave around and we thought

754
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,880
that oh these things got motion they're

755
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,159
big maybe they'll scare birds better

756
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,000
than some of these other devices uh so

757
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:56,559
we set up sight pairs again with the

758
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,798
same criteria and we had uh one farm

759
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,918
with a dancer one farm with out a dancer

760
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,038
within 30 Mi based on the previous

761
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:05,320
year's damage and block size again two

762
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,919
to 3 weeks before Harvest and we move

763
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,960
the dancers every two to three days uh

764
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,720
around the field so you can see sort of

765
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,399
the pattering every couple days it be in

766
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,159
a new spot we had to either these are

767
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,278
electric powered fans you have to run

768
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,399
them by either electric cord which we

769
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:22,319
didn't have any many cases or a gas

770
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:23,918
generator which means that the grower

771
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,519
had to go out there every day and refill

772
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,919
the gas generator because the generators

773
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,679
had run about eight or nine hours and

774
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:31,640
then they'd run out of gas

775
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,840
uh but they Growers are willing to do

776
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,559
that we looked at Sweet Cherry damage

777
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:39,599
and what we saw with the dancers and

778
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:41,519
sweet cherries a slight benefit not

779
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,240
significantly different slightly less

780
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:48,079
damage you still see lots of farm the

781
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,720
farm uh variability and uh again that's

782
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,639
very typical with bird damage that's why

783
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,798
you got to do a lot of farm if you do

784
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,399
one or two Farms you're not going to

785
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,720
learn anything you got to be doing five

786
00:29:54,398 --> 00:30:00,038
10 Farm to get some sense of what works

787
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:03,440
and what doesn't blueberries again uh

788
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:06,759
slight difference uh uh with the dancers

789
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,399
had about 6% fruit loss uh on the dancer

790
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:11,879
plots a little over 8% controls we look

791
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:15,119
at berri's loss per day that was

792
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:18,159
marginally significant at 0.005 so again

793
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:19,879
slightly fewer loss but at those type of

794
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,159
differences it doesn't justify the cost

795
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,519
of running the things or putting it out

796
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:26,880
in the field and blueberries where we

797
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:29,798
did see a difference was wine grapes and

798
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,159
uh what we saw was a about half the

799
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:33,639
level of damage where we had daners and

800
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,240
wine grapes and it was significant at

801
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,840
the 0.01 level so these things appeared

802
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,880
to work relatively well in wine grapes

803
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,759
during the first two years still a lot

804
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,840
of farm to farm variability and it

805
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:47,038
doesn't work everywhere here you can see

806
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:48,720
on this Farm in Michigan the the dancer

807
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,960
plot actually had higher damage than the

808
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,360
control why said we don't know but again

809
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,278
you just see tons of variability in New

810
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:59,158
York we had more consistent results with

811
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,038
the air dancing and I think a lot of

812
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:04,200
that has to do with field size our

813
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:06,119
blocks uh where we were running this our

814
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,399
grape Vineyards are tended to be smaller

815
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:10,158
on average than they were in Michigan

816
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,079
our blueberry Fields also in New York

817
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,480
tend to be much smaller on average than

818
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:17,038
the typical Michigan Blueberry field so

819
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,319
where you have smaller blocks smaller

820
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,480
sites uh these devices are more likely

821
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:25,359
to benefit you in

822
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:28,240
work we uh did a a comparison between

823
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:31,079
dancers and control

824
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,440
and uh in 2014 and used two dances per

825
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,000
side you can see how highly

826
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,360
significantly different except for far a

827
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,759
everything was highly significantly

828
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:40,879
different so these devices really did

829
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,759
work on the wine grapes and The Growers

830
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,360
have talked about it we had one grower

831
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:47,440
had a naming contest for his device out

832
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,959
by his Vineyard and his customers named

833
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,360
him Mr penino and so that's what he

834
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,639
called his device he thought it was a

835
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,918
big deal a little bit of marketing with

836
00:31:53,638 --> 00:31:59,359
it we looked at other variables related

837
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:01,639
to bird damage and again the the

838
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:04,000
telephone wires kept coming up but we

839
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:05,759
couldn't see anything significant in

840
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,720
cherries or grapes and when we looked at

841
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,440
blueberries actually the blueberry

842
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,558
fields that were closest to the

843
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,519
telephone wires had less damage and the

844
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,558
reason we think is that those tended to

845
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,359
be much larger Fields so the damage was

846
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:21,158
more dispersed and so there was get no

847
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,398
strong relationship and again when we

848
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,440
looked at netting in paired plots where

849
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:28,599
we had dancers and no dancers and both

850
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,278
areas were netting there was uh no

851
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:32,839
significant difference and so what we're

852
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:36,000
seeing is birds are getting through this

853
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:37,678
netting with this larger mes size uh

854
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,200
we've seen that on Long Island for years

855
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,559
the birds are using the netting for a

856
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,840
perch and then they poke their heads

857
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,879
through and damage the grapes through

858
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:45,519
the netting so Growers are using a lot

859
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,159
of netting spending a lot of money on it

860
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,359
but we didn't see it significantly

861
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:50,360
really reduce the bird

862
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:56,319
damage so who are the culprits uh these

863
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:58,599
are the common bird species we see in in

864
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:00,278
fruit orchards in New York and Michigan

865
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:02,678
and one of the take-home messages I want

866
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:04,720
to leave with you just because you see a

867
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:06,759
bird there doesn't mean that's the bird

868
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,480
that's causing the damage and we've got

869
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:09,919
data to back that up now we look at

870
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,240
sweet cherries in

871
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,559
2014 the most frequent sighting by far

872
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,200
in terms of number of birds were

873
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:20,119
American Robins and European starlings

874
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,159
were number two we looked at Birds

875
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:25,000
taking and eating fruit American Robins

876
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:26,919
were number one and number of fruits

877
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,519
consumed American Robins were number one

878
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,679
that lines up pretty well well but when

879
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:32,278
we look at time spent eating fruit

880
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:34,159
European starlings even though they're

881
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,440
the second most frequent bird they don't

882
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,200
eat a lot of fruit and it was cedar

883
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,480
waxwings were number two in terms of

884
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,319
eating fruit and feeding on spent time

885
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,200
foraging on fruit but yet we see very

886
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,398
few zedar wax wings in The Vineyards but

887
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,360
they do a lot of damage so again Growers

888
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,398
may be missing the culprit in these

889
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:53,798
cases uh because they smaller less

890
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:56,518
visible

891
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:58,798
Birds we saw similar patterns in

892
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:01,200
blueberries again the most frequent bird

893
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,319
we saw on blueberry were American Robins

894
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,880
followed by Baltimore oror but when we

895
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:09,119
look at time spent eating fruit American

896
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,119
Robins ate very few fruits either time

897
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,960
or fruits consumed they were almost dead

898
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,480
last even though they were the most

899
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,559
common bird seen it was the Baltimore

900
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,240
orils and the Cedar Wax Wings again that

901
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:22,199
spent most of the time consuming the

902
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:24,118
fruit so I see this with Growers a lot

903
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,039
particularly with turkeys too they say

904
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,679
all the turkeys are damaging my my

905
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:31,239
Vineyards well we really didn't see

906
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,639
turkeys taking grapes just just because

907
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:34,078
they wander through and they're big and

908
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,358
visible the grower thinks that's what's

909
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,359
causing the problem and it may not

910
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:43,000
be what we found is that in our field

911
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,078
trials in New York and Michigan that the

912
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,599
Haw Kites and discust callers and even

913
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,519
the combination to really didn't do

914
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:51,200
anything and past studies had pretty

915
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:54,838
misre exols too we did find though that

916
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:57,039
the dancers showed some optimistic uh

917
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:58,679
results in grapes and in fact we had a

918
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,759
couple of our operating grap Growers

919
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,480
that wanted to buy the air dancers from

920
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,320
us after the end of the trial they were

921
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,880
they liked them so much uh they do take

922
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,559
intensive management you got to either

923
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,358
have electric power or you got to be out

924
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,320
there like I said moving them around

925
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:15,400
filling that gas generator every day to

926
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,920
keep the the wind sock up and running

927
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,480
Nets didn't significantly reduce bird

928
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,480
damage that we saw in the dancer site

929
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,119
Pairs and uh we actually saw slightly

930
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,320
lower bird damage uh with blueberries

931
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:30,559
related to the telephone wires but again

932
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,760
all the sites of wires tend to be larger

933
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,000
blocks I think they just had less damage

934
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,000
in general not nothing really related to

935
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,320
the

936
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,880
wires so I just go back to integrated

937
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,960
Wildlife Management when you're working

938
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,760
on farms or working with a farm owners

939
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,240
it's really important to assess

940
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,240
everything that's going on what are the

941
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,159
species causing damage which crops are

942
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,679
affected uh how many acres what time

943
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:56,440
what's the housing density what are your

944
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:59,358
neighbors like a lot of these sound

945
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,720
devices neighbors don't like them and uh

946
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,838
so again if your Farm's more rural you

947
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:05,399
might have more options available to you

948
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,440
and then you've got to go through you

949
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,440
know what can I afford and I would argue

950
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,519
that in most years for at least fruit

951
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,159
crops in New York doesn't pay to do any

952
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,318
of this stuff except for maybe air

953
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:18,318
dancers and wine grapes but if you get

954
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:20,719
that bad crop year where you've had a

955
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:23,119
late freeze or you've had a drought and

956
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:24,519
the yield is low you really need to do

957
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,519
something that's the area you want to do

958
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:28,318
your bird management because it's going

959
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:30,838
to have an impact on a percentage of

960
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:33,838
fruit that you might

961
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:36,799
save let's see it's important to

962
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:38,480
reassess too if things don't work why

963
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,839
what can I do differently are there

964
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,000
something else I haven't tried what

965
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,358
other options are available to me a lot

966
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,760
of these things The Growers put them in

967
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:46,440
the field and they walk away from them

968
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,400
and they just assume they're working but

969
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,079
if you don't assess you don't know and

970
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,079
very few Growers go to the trouble of

971
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,480
actually looking at fruit damage and and

972
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,160
actual

973
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,400
loss just want to share website with you

974
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:01,159
uh while life control. info there's

975
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,800
results of all sorts of extension

976
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:05,639
Publications for different species if

977
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,000
you're interested in that and also uh

978
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:09,639
we'll eventually get uh more data from

979
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,719
our research projects and links to

980
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,759
papers and stuff up as uh we get more of

981
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:15,480
it written up uh but I appreciate

982
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,760
everybody's attention and be glad to

983
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,760
answer questions folks might

984
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,599
have thanks a lot lot lot of good

985
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:29,239
information um you know your early maap

986
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,440
showing kind of where most of the

987
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:33,838
economic damage as you point out that

988
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,159
matches up with where the Farms are but

989
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:38,920
from a farmer's perspective you know I'm

990
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:42,279
just curious if you looked at the data

991
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:44,480
in terms of damage per Farm or per field

992
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,720
you know what I'm saying yeah we haven't

993
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,679
really looked at it all at all on a

994
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,879
damage for field basis or the way

995
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:53,879
Growers react to it obviously you know

996
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,240
if you getting a relatively small fields

997
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,599
that are high value and you a lot of

998
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,279
your income coming and if you've got

999
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,440
wild life damage could be more

1000
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,200
economically painful that's for sure uh

1001
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,800
but we really haven't looked at into

1002
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:07,519
that in any detail at all we looked at

1003
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,519
the sort of the broad Trends broad

1004
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:15,280
statistics um really interesting that

1005
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,280
the Dan meod Work

1006
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:28,118
Well certain that really

1007
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:34,079
yeah that's a really good question and

1008
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,920
we did try to collect bird species

1009
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,960
information for the grave but when we

1010
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,318
did our foraging observations both of

1011
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:44,720
stationary and mobile we found so few

1012
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:46,519
Birds foraging there we we saw Birds but

1013
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:49,000
we actually saw more fly overs than

1014
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:51,318
anything else birds that really never uh

1015
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,159
fed and so we had zero in terms of

1016
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:55,838
foraging observation in grapes uh so

1017
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,279
again the damage was relatively low

1018
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,759
compared to the other clout and that may

1019
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,119
be another reason why uh the air dancers

1020
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,119
tended to to work better

1021
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,119
there this kind not right on the

1022
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,920
agricultural ends but I see managing

1023
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:11,720
kened East up there and I know that's a

1024
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,358
real challenge for a lot of communities

1025
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:15,799
and fancy industrial complexes and

1026
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:17,759
everything else they seem to be hanging

1027
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,519
out more and more and more what's the

1028
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,079
like the elevator sound bite on the

1029
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,639
future of managing and whether they're

1030
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,079
going to just become more and more

1031
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,679
common year round or what you the what

1032
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,160
we call the resident or the local

1033
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:33,159
breeding Goose block uh it's plateaued

1034
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:36,318
now but it plateaued at a really high

1035
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:38,519
level I it's or tens of thousands of

1036
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:40,800
birds what we want above what we want in

1037
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:43,759
New York state currently uh if you go

1038
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,160
back a couple of decades there were more

1039
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,200
what we call the migratory geese the

1040
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:49,358
ones we all grew up with that breed in

1041
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,078
Canada winter in the Chesapeake North

1042
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:54,078
Carolina uh but about a decade and a

1043
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,720
half ago that flip-flopped and so now

1044
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,760
they're actually more resident birds in

1045
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:00,159
the Eastern flowy local breeding birds

1046
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,680
than migrants and they cause all sorts

1047
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:04,480
of problems and they are short distance

1048
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:06,239
migrants they do migrate but only when

1049
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,800
they have to so they're the ones that

1050
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,399
breed locally they're here pretty much

1051
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,240
year round as well they need two things

1052
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,599
they need open water which they have on

1053
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:14,759
cuga Lake year round and they need grass

1054
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,680
so the only thing that's going to drive

1055
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,839
them out of here is if we e enough deep

1056
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,919
persistent snow that they can't for then

1057
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,159
they force to go south until that snow

1058
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,960
melts so they're here most of the year

1059
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:27,480
we've got a pilot Goose project in

1060
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,159
Stewart park right now where we we've

1061
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,599
been using uh uh the uh town of Ithaca

1062
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:34,799
Goose committee wanted to use only

1063
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:36,559
non-lethal devices and I said told them

1064
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,160
right off they don't expect a whole lot

1065
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,039
from nonleaf Hit uh we were able to at

1066
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:43,639
least move birds out of Stuart Park

1067
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:46,519
using uh uh firecrackers and radio

1068
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:48,440
control cars we got them out of the park

1069
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:51,199
and uh but they didn't go far they went

1070
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,960
to the inlet and cast Park which we

1071
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,759
expected what's that it terrify all the

1072
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,480
it didn't terrify the park users we

1073
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,119
tried to do it at times a day for very

1074
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,480
early in the morning very late in the

1075
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,358
evening not during the middle of day

1076
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,039
when there are a lot of Park users and

1077
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:06,880
so we're be putting together a report

1078
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:08,199
for the uh city of itha here soon on the

1079
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,480
goose efforts they really need to start

1080
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:12,759
earlier in the year what we learned we

1081
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,480
banded 425 geese and collared 200 adults

1082
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,040
in Stewart Park this summer so if you

1083
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,880
see a goose waning around Stewart park

1084
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:20,719
with a big yellow collar that's one we

1085
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,358
put on and what we learned was that most

1086
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:25,399
the geese that caused the problem in

1087
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:28,000
Stewart Park in June and July are not

1088
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,960
local uh breeding birds we only found

1089
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,880
about 10 to 12 pairs that actually had

1090
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,800
goling a total of about 60 goling that

1091
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,440
were produced in and around the park the

1092
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,960
rest of them are what we call local mol

1093
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,000
mol migrants there's so much water and

1094
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,079
grass around Stuart Park it's a perfect

1095
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,679
molting area when they mol they drop

1096
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:47,519
their flight feathers for five weeks and

1097
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:49,318
they cannot fly so birds come in and

1098
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,480
they look for places like Stuart Park

1099
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:53,838
where they can fly in drop those flight

1100
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,880
feather just sort of hang out feed

1101
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,799
defecate everywhere create all sorts of

1102
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,358
Havoc for five or six weeks weeks till

1103
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,560
they regrow their flight feathers in

1104
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:03,679
Late July they're on off again somewhere

1105
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:05,639
else uh but we've got to live with the

1106
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:09,239
mess during that the midsummer when the

1107
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:11,358
parks got the highest use what the town

1108
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:13,279
and the city need to do is move those

1109
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:14,880
birds out before the Mt they didn't do

1110
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,519
it and so that's one of the

1111
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,079
recommendations going to be before they

1112
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:20,199
drop their flight feathers that's when

1113
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,720
you need to do the Intensive hazing and

1114
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:23,279
non-lethal stuff to try to get those

1115
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:24,959
birds out of there get them to Mt

1116
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,400
somewhere else and then instead of

1117
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,159
having 450 geese in Stuart Park and late

1118
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,000
June hopefully we can get it down to

1119
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:32,000
maybe 40 or

1120
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:36,719
50 any other questions PA I was going to

1121
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:39,279
ask a quick question about wild boar I

1122
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:41,279
know for a time we did have them in New

1123
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,720
York it looks like they're no longer

1124
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,519
here but can you say something about

1125
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,719
them because they can do a lot of damage

1126
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:50,119
yeah we're fortunate that uh DEC EG

1127
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:52,078
markets and USDA wildlife services saw

1128
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:54,680
the the wild boore issues starting to

1129
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,280
emerge and we did have some localized

1130
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:58,719
breeding population in New York there

1131
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,280
was of on courland on DOA county line

1132
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,799
one in tyoga County uh one up in Clinton

1133
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,559
County in Northeast New York and one on

1134
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,000
the Sullivan Delaware County border and

1135
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:10,960
uh uh USDA wildlife services staff got a

1136
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
contract to come in and do eradication

1137
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,838
and uh USDA and DEC staff really did a

1138
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,480
good job uh essentially we've eradicated

1139
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:20,400
breeding wild boards from New York they

1140
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,039
still get escapes every now and then and

1141
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,039
there's new legislation that's passed

1142
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:26,719
that uh Farmers can't keep Wild boore on

1143
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:28,679
their Farm I think it was as of last

1144
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,919
summer if I remember right and so

1145
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:32,679
hopefully that will eliminate chances of

1146
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,440
seeing wild boes in New York in the

1147
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:36,759
future uh Pennsylvania right across our

1148
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,440
border still has wild boards and

1149
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,119
shooting preserves and they escape that

1150
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,639
was the source of the tyoga County

1151
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,680
population so we're still going to have

1152
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:46,358
to deal with that

1153
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:50,279
occasionally any last question you

1154
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:54,519
mentioned a lot about what Farmers to

1155
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:58,200
prot are there any um State programs for

1156
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:58,199
example to

1157
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,719
I

1158
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,599
know yeah yeah we actually done research

1159
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:09,519
on campus with deer fertility control

1160
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,000
and sterilization and we found after

1161
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:14,119
about six seven years of effort the best

1162
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,639
we could do with sterilization even

1163
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,358
combining it with our campus deer

1164
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:20,159
hunting program was to stabilize the

1165
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:21,880
herd couldn't reduce it and so that's

1166
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,759
when we went to our deer damage permit

1167
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,800
and started actually removing animals at

1168
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,400
night over bait and we were able to cut

1169
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,800
the herd in about half in two years on a

1170
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,559
damage permit and other plac have seen

1171
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,920
that we did a just finishing up an

1172
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,519
experiment in the village of cuga

1173
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,680
heights this the fourth year the first

1174
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:40,759
two years they couldn't get approval for

1175
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:43,558
shooting uh so they hired in White

1176
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,440
Buffalo a contractor and uh we work with

1177
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:48,119
white buffalo and using Cornell

1178
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,519
veterinarians we sterilized 99% of the

1179
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,000
female deer in the village of cuga

1180
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,639
heights the first two years and what we

1181
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,159
found was that having that high

1182
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:58,838
proportion sterilize for two years the

1183
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,799
population dropped up by 30% there

1184
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:04,440
wasn't enough immigration uh to replace

1185
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,400
that lack of fonds and then the village

1186
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,240
got approval for a deer damage permit a

1187
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,880
kill permit they contracted with the

1188
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,239
white buffalo to come back in the last

1189
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,760
two years uh White Buffalo's actually

1190
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,118
done deer removal with uh crossbows at

1191
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,280
night that was approved by Village

1192
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,400
Police and so with the two years of

1193
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,760
removal now they've dropped at another

1194
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,200
40% so they have 70% reduction in deer

1195
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,200
in the village of cuga heights right now

1196
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,598
with that integrated program question is

1197
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:31,279
will they sustain it it's a deer doing

1198
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,079
deer managements like mowing the lawn

1199
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,680
guess what it comes back you got to do

1200
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:37,559
it all the time you can't wait a year if

1201
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:39,039
you if you just you know give them a two

1202
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:40,440
three year break guess what they I'll

1203
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:42,400
reproduce you they'll be right back

1204
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,760
there and you lose all the all the gains

1205
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,559
that you

1206
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,559
made all right well let's

1207
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:55,239
