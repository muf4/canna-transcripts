1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,859
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:04,859
University

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:11,609
okay so my talk today is about

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,118
understanding the genetic architecture

5
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:17,399
of quantitative traits and this endless

6
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:19,079
quest that we have to try and understand

7
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,599
quantitative traits and whether it's

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:29,969
really pretty cool in terms of plant

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:32,399
breeding and I'm going to build my time

10
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:37,289
and industry and finish up with telling

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:40,679
you something about Cobie project so my

12
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:46,079
PhD I was incredibly lucky I had perfect

13
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:49,219
project mildew in India and pearl millet

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,079
is just an incredible crop has these

15
00:00:49,219 --> 00:01:00,450
beautiful long panicles late in the

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:03,600
pear-shaped seeds and it can be popped

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:10,890
like popcorn it also has a higher

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:20,159
nutrient content and most importantly it

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:23,670
can withstand long periods of no

20
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:28,049
rainfall and then when it rains it's

21
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:30,810
really an amazing crop and it was also a

22
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,570
success with the Green Revolution there

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,549
were several there were two male sterile

24
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:38,250
lines produced in Tifton Georgia in the

25
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,200
US and with those they started to

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,868
produce hybrids and those hybrids were

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,509
very successful and were widely accepted

28
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:49,560
and we've spread all over India when the

29
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:52,950
first several domains Fanny Mills you

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,920
made that epidemics occurred causing a

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,960
massive loss in yields from 13 3 million

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,870
metric tons in a single year so

33
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:05,149
the disease is caused by a pathogen

34
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:09,039
called cross for a grammar Nicola it's

35
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:11,960
an O my seat another goodbye a truth and

36
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:14,449
resistance is quantitative so you see a

37
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,700
continuous distribution you screen for

38
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:18,469
resistance but it's also environmentally

39
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:20,889
variable so there's obviously some

40
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:24,469
either environmental differences or

41
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:28,849
population very little was known about

42
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:31,639
the disease then very few single Zeus

43
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:33,979
for isolates and no differentials are

44
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:40,879
being characterized but it's a really

45
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:43,819
amazing pathogen instead of growing into

46
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,340
the leaf and forming a local lesion what

47
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:50,650
it actually does is it grows down to the

48
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,650
growing point of the plant

49
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:03,440
half leaves this one and this part was

50
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:07,929
differentiated so you get these half

51
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,930
leaf symptoms showing infections

52
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:19,239
infection you get this really wild panic

53
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,730
so my project was to Matt qtls for

54
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:33,319
resistance pearl millet and because of

55
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:36,019
quarantine restrictions they couldn't

56
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,639
take pathogens from parts of Africa and

57
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,469
parts then deer are moving to another

58
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,719
location too

59
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:44,210
they were very strictly would not

60
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:47,449
allowed to move any of those diseased

61
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,250
plants and my supervisor was in India at

62
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:55,369
the time he was working at a Cossack

63
00:03:49,250 --> 00:04:06,050
which is the International merits that's

64
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:09,530
what they were working on which was a

65
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:12,620
little crazy because the place he chose

66
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,860
in the UK was North Wales which is the

67
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,989
rainiest place in the UK it's if you

68
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:23,150
think seattle is rainy it's like three

69
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:25,879
or four times one of the rainiest places

70
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:28,339
in the world but surprisingly pearl

71
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:32,899
millet liked it grew pretty well that's

72
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:38,019
me doing Danny mildew screens in Bangor

73
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:38,019
in Wales in the UK and we also rep

74
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:49,538
and so cut a long story short this was

75
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:52,418
the essence of the results pearl millet

76
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:54,159
has seven linkage groups and each of

77
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:57,478
these graphs is a separate linkage group

78
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,970
and with the different color lines

79
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:04,478
different pathogen populations on the

80
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:15,610
y-axis is the log of the odds ratio LOD

81
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:17,680
score with a special about two and also

82
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:22,479
some key tales of minor effect like you

83
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,900
see on and the amazing thing was those

84
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:32,908
qtls were extremely stable over repeated

85
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:38,879
screens different disease pressures and

86
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:47,709
I did carry on to try and isolate single

87
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:52,360
populations and found even more so a

88
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:54,579
huge amount of a Burlinson and a huge

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:06:00,370
amount of resistance in permanent

90
00:05:54,579 --> 00:06:05,668
materials so this was a real story there

91
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:08,829
was a very popular hybrid called hhp

92
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:11,978
disease and by integrating one of these

93
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:16,209
Danny mildew resistances into hhp beasts

94
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:19,360
of 67 we could make it resistance now

95
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:22,060
how long in that kind of environment can

96
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,919
you have a resistance last probably two

97
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,259
to three years and the pearl millet

98
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,408
breeders have actually been very clever

99
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:31,360
they've diversified their parental

100
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:34,329
materials that going into hybrids they

101
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,280
interest new resistance genes over time

102
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:40,978
and they've stacked resistance genes and

103
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:43,089
so in this very diverse host-pathogen

104
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:48,699
environment where easily they could have

105
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:51,288
had continuous epidemics they've managed

106
00:06:48,699 --> 00:07:00,348
to keep increasing yields

107
00:06:51,288 --> 00:07:02,628
a great success story but then this is

108
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:07,688
what I find is more typically the case

109
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:12,468
is that the project I worked on with

110
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:16,599
late light resistance and the late

111
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:16,598
lights caused by fight or infest and

112
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:27,978
Irish potato famine of 1845 and

113
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:30,528
immigration resistance last two three

114
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:34,610
years in potatoes they tend to look for

115
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:36,949
general resistance so many many q two

116
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:40,098
L's of small effect and so that's what

117
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:42,709
we try to do in tomato too so we were

118
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:46,248
working with UC riverside this is a

119
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:49,968
project at UC Davis with I'll just call

120
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:54,770
my coffee he'd found this wild tomato

121
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:57,889
line that was resistant by tougher

122
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:59,598
infestations and forgive me I forget the

123
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:02,959
names wrong because I changed their

124
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:12,468
names to species for tomato so what was

125
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:20,088
her suitum is now so this shows the wild

126
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:23,689
species completely clean no disease did

127
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:29,329
bidirectional backcrosses and in by

128
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:39,889
directional and this was the results of

129
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:43,728
this study I'm just showing sometimes

130
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:45,560
the QTL would overlap but the peaks are

131
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,319
not necessarily distinct the peaks are

132
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:50,838
these little triangles here this is

133
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:54,379
esculenta genetic map on the left and

134
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,560
the hirsute him on the right the more we

135
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:59,509
screened the more cutie else we found

136
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,188
the more confused we were with what we

137
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:02,328
were going to do with this and what

138
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:05,559
we're finding because we were also

139
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:05,559
mapping application

140
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,540
probably a big mistake to be mapping in

141
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:17,839
but esculenta more like a per second is

142
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:21,049
this nice compact bushy plant and her

143
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,780
suitum is this horrible wieldy rambling

144
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:27,079
indeterminant plant so basically what we

145
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:30,019
ended up mapping was a lot of cutie ELLs

146
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,540
for plan architecture and canopy the

147
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:34,490
more open the canopy is they're less

148
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:37,610
disease the less humid it is and the

149
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,980
less disease is built up but we did

150
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,889
because oh this was one of the qtls that

151
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,129
I was particularly excited about and I

152
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:49,419
really wanted to see where this QTL went

153
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:51,620
so QTL for dispersal so this is the

154
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:56,899
cultivated parent and you can just see

155
00:09:51,620 --> 00:10:01,159
the little droplet this is also after

156
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:03,169
inoculation and just disappears it's

157
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:05,179
like magic just disappears into the leaf

158
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:21,229
and that's thought to be due to the

159
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:25,789
different tricone differences so we

160
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:28,399
definitely pursued this QTL and this was

161
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:31,789
the end result and this is a lot to take

162
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:35,299
in but each of these mini blocks is

163
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:37,370
basically a set of introgression lines

164
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:41,229
and so we're just showing four different

165
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:56,720
qtls here and the cutie ELLs are in red

166
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:59,740
and so for example this line markers

167
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,740
which are amplified

168
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:19,090
but when screening but we just didn't

169
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:24,960
have anything we could QTL were all

170
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:27,850
co-located with some on the germplasm

171
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:32,860
such as plant height shape maturity

172
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:37,210
yield and none of these were usable in

173
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:40,570
plant breeding sense and it was

174
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:53,170
published which is good results as well

175
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:54,879
but in terms of being so I'd had several

176
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:57,129
of these projects where I was getting

177
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:00,519
increasingly frustrated with being able

178
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:02,590
to move QTL into cultivated plasm being

179
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,480
able to move them into breeding programs

180
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:09,009
and I was kind of sick of just

181
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:12,399
collecting QTL never going anywhere I'm

182
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:15,159
pretty sure industry has the answer so I

183
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:27,009
was recruited to industry they have lots

184
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:32,589
of money they have systems and again I

185
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:37,299
was disappointed issues that we had an

186
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:41,800
industry corn

187
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:45,669
I mean Mazin soybean was the parents are

188
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:48,129
extremely cycles extremely fast to the

189
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:50,529
breeding process you cross your parents

190
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:52,990
you make your selections you can

191
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:55,809
constantly shifting that curve for yield

192
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,600
and moving it towards higher yields and

193
00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:01,059
as soon as you have those selections

194
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,370
from the progeny bales become the new

195
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:05,409
parents in there they're using old

196
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,419
parents again and again it's always new

197
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:11,289
parents going into that breeding cycle

198
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:16,360
and that's how you make quickly

199
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:39,459
and if you had a QTL you mat QTL you

200
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:41,399
really have to slow down breeding cycle

201
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,389
and you remember they're also

202
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:55,079
interesting transgenes

203
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:58,659
so they're trying to manage and

204
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,780
association mapping was it were a couple

205
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:07,350
of groups working on associate

206
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:07,350
association nothing even less because

207
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,669
don't contain elite lines don't contain

208
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:19,080
lines of high relevance to breeding

209
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:19,079
population and so even if a QTL is found

210
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:31,809
the answer Jean Luc's papers up here is

211
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:36,400
to be able to map qtls and in the actual

212
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:39,069
breeding population it might be small

213
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,980
but you can use pedigree information and

214
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:45,340
you can use shared haplotypes to be able

215
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,050
to map as you're breeding so you're not

216
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,509
mapping details in separate populations

217
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:51,399
and then bringing the QTA you're doing

218
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:56,350
it actually in the breeding populations

219
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:58,000
and there was a second method it was

220
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,070
very popular in the soybean breeding

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,220
program called breeding bias and

222
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:05,290
basically that just looked at the very

223
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,420
very simple look to the alleles and

224
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:10,029
ancestral populations and the alleles

225
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:12,490
and elite populations those increase in

226
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:14,889
frequency breeders had selected from

227
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:18,899
them breed as a GERD so they must be

228
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:18,899
good and so that was the premise

229
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:37,389
over time we had so many of these many

230
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:37,389
of them were closely linked or had

231
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:56,089
closely linked with positive and

232
00:15:40,850 --> 00:16:01,360
negative alleles actually had so it

233
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:01,360
really became too much information and

234
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:10,519
as I think about how we were handling

235
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:19,459
these like QTL would pop up from one

236
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:26,049
generation where the QTL is and I

237
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:26,049
apologize for this next slide I think

238
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,230
this is like what I imagine it's like

239
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:51,440
serious representation qtls illustrates

240
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:57,889
it very nicely breeding programs this is

241
00:16:51,440 --> 00:17:02,300
a stole from Roberta tuberosa to quote

242
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:04,669
it says forgiving QTL no or negative

243
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:06,379
effects depending on the scenario in

244
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:08,689
this case it was drought this

245
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,669
complication has slowed considerably of

246
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:21,019
the utilization of DNA breeding quality

247
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:23,929
of QTL so you can imagine that everyone

248
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:27,078
was extremely excited when genomic

249
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:29,570
selection came on the scene and started

250
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:31,970
to make waves and we started to see that

251
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:33,289
we could make a real impact with genomic

252
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,420
selection

253
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:41,269
doesn't try and understand the

254
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,269
underlying genes of quantitative trait

255
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:48,210
trait so you have your training

256
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:51,990
population which is being phenotype and

257
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:56,610
genotype and that's used to train your

258
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:58,289
breeding material which is only saves

259
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:01,589
you a huge amount of money to just

260
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:06,899
genotype it calculate what's called a

261
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:09,058
gbb or genetic estimated values and make

262
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,820
selections based on those values and

263
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:13,819
it's really what is going to take

264
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,360
and John Hickey he's a quantitative

265
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:29,380
geneticist at the Roslin Institute has a

266
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:31,599
nice quote he feels like molecular

267
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,370
biologist took over plant breeding it

268
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:37,240
used to be the domain of quantitative

269
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:40,869
genetics and all these QTL were suddenly

270
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,809
molecular geneticists were the ones that

271
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:46,469
were running plant breeding and now with

272
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:46,470
genomic selection

273
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:55,079
I'm breeding back into the wrong arms

274
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:58,299
and you can see it for some of the very

275
00:18:55,079 --> 00:19:02,169
visible products that pioneer has had

276
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:04,779
they bred drought-tolerant corn some

277
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:07,660
seminars here on this a product called a

278
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:11,639
series of products called aqua max where

279
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,640
they're using genomic selection to

280
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,660
well-watered conditions and high yield

281
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:19,329
under drought conditions and so you see

282
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:22,029
aqua max products at these green squares

283
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:23,949
which have very high yields and the

284
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:33,369
drought conditions and most

285
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:44,049
interestingly these pre-k was working in

286
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:46,359
markers and this shows the number of

287
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:49,089
snips needed to give a good prediction

288
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:55,209
accuracy in European corn and I think

289
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:57,819
this was some diluting design and so at

290
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:00,250
about 300 markers you've pretty much got

291
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:04,450
a plateau for your prediction accuracy

292
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:07,059
there's no need you can imagine in a

293
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,309
maze double haploid breeding population

294
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:11,849
going to be even fewer markers that

295
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,849
you're going to need

296
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:18,840
the type of technology was a challenge

297
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:22,019
to begin with had to be low cost and low

298
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:24,899
cost as an equal to the cost of a corn

299
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:27,599
flux or less or soybean plot which is

300
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,538
about five dollars and has to be Ray

301
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,750
robust high percentage whether you've

302
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:35,519
got horrible samples coming in from some

303
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,038
part of the world or really bad do you

304
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:42,139
make them really stable across different

305
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:44,910
conditions you have to have a consistent

306
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,460
because of the turnaround time you can't

307
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:50,220
be imputing data you can't be messing

308
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:54,450
around trying to match up with different

309
00:20:50,220 --> 00:21:01,100
market sets markers in them breeders

310
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:04,529
really like to add their own trace and

311
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:09,990
one important key just to mention here

312
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:13,889
because industry went into took a foray

313
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:16,679
into sequencing GPS technologies lo

314
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:19,799
sequence coverage technologies and just

315
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:23,190
found by informatics was too expensive

316
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:29,490
and too time-consuming to be able to

317
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:33,690
handle so they really needed matrix with

318
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:36,750
a very fast turnaround time technologies

319
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,070
in this space not sure what they're

320
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,369
called now but they used to be called

321
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:43,470
their next-generation genotyping or

322
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:46,139
targeted sequencing technologies so

323
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:49,200
these are like in-between sequencing and

324
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,179
genotyping technologies we have specific

325
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,090
primers and probes that can be amplicon

326
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:56,580
based on like aged face and everything

327
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:58,889
just goes into one big bucket and is

328
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:00,509
amplified at once and the samples are

329
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,730
bar coded so you could distinguish

330
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:06,298
between them and the most popular one

331
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:08,880
right now is technology's been looking

332
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:16,529
at with high DT and that's really low

333
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:19,020
cost and also highly multiplexed so if

334
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:21,089
you look at the turnaround time that we

335
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:25,470
were dealing with maize that will have

336
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:27,220
food production after you doubled your

337
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,929
material

338
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,319
you had about two weeks for

339
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:34,298
transplanting and the more data you

340
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,579
could get back before transplanting the

341
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:39,279
better because transplanting was

342
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:42,849
extremely expensive so they want to be

343
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:45,009
able to get back within two weeks so

344
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:47,048
that was about a data sample and that's

345
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:48,759
not a few samples that's tens of

346
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:53,079
thousands of samples in that one day

347
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:56,109
about a day for DNA extraction maybe two

348
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:58,869
days shipping two days living data and

349
00:22:56,109 --> 00:23:01,298
doing a collection analysis they left

350
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:03,219
five five days to get your genotyping

351
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:06,220
dates back so those are the kind of

352
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:09,120
timelines we have to meet in the double

353
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:13,180
haploid scenario

354
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:18,939
and so genotyping came about science

355
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:21,700
more about running logistics what steps

356
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,950
can i co-locate I've got my double hi

357
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,769
Floyd lab in the middle of South America

358
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,870
with very limited workforce where do I

359
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:30,819
put my DNA prep lab I can't put it next

360
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:33,219
to my double haploid lab because I'm

361
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:34,629
probably gonna fail so now I have to

362
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,579
have an ID in the extraction lab

363
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,560
separate to that and in those days

364
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:42,369
vendors didn't want to mess around with

365
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:44,559
plant DNA extractions and so he pretty

366
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:48,099
much had two steps of shipping from

367
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:51,099
double haploids to DNA extraction to

368
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:58,179
your genotyping lab so you really had to

369
00:23:51,099 --> 00:24:00,369
have end to end the biggest risk and

370
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:03,100
this whole thing became shipping and

371
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:06,579
customs and understanding which

372
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:17,949
countries would tolerate important

373
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:22,269
exports so meanwhile back in the

374
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:23,860
developing developing countries this

375
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:26,170
graph from the Bill and Melinda Gates

376
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:34,229
Foundation shows increases in yield

377
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:34,230
between 61 and you can see the US and

378
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:44,769
India had some increase but not very

379
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:47,350
much and Africa is actually pretty flat

380
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:51,490
it's not significantly different over

381
00:24:47,349 --> 00:25:00,359
all of that time almost 60 years so this

382
00:24:51,490 --> 00:25:03,069
is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

383
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:05,379
decided that one of the solutions that

384
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:07,839
this was to start implementing genomic

385
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:13,960
selection in the breeding programs that

386
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:18,519
support these countries and so that's

387
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:21,880
where Kobe was born and this the goal of

388
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:22,720
this project is transform reading by

389
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,580
enabling

390
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:39,670
the implementation of genomic a marker

391
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:42,939
assisted selection by routine there are

392
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,590
main goals was build databases to

393
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,900
connect to breeding management systems

394
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:51,159
and to build and connect tools and

395
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:53,680
analysis pipelines and we're a global

396
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,380
community we are based here at Cornell

397
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,320
and also at the Boyce Thompson Institute

398
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:02,680
down the road and we collaborate with

399
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:06,579
three different cities simit which is a

400
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:10,930
Mexico maize and wheat eco set in India

401
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:14,829
for sorghum and chickpeas working back

402
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:22,330
and airy in the Philippines where we

403
00:26:14,829 --> 00:26:27,579
work with brace institute tool

404
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:35,889
development and we've built within this

405
00:26:27,579 --> 00:27:11,019
community and extract data the client

406
00:26:35,890 --> 00:27:15,660
the system into the system we store in

407
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:28,750
two different directions directions and

408
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:29,380
whole thing is built in industry some

409
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:33,309
base

410
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:37,270
marking tests so we have some test data

411
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:40,480
sets 5,000 samples 32 million markers

412
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:48,629
and this shows different databases that

413
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:48,630
were and it's even better than some

414
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,009
we're handling

415
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:03,960
again for extracting this just shows

416
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:13,470
increasing sizes of data and extracting

417
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:15,750
them different information we are also

418
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:26,190
developing tools most importantly a

419
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:28,319
genomics we have open source tools in a

420
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:31,558
tool called flapjack which is a candy

421
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:34,339
bar in the UK and that's to visualize

422
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:39,410
the data and then we're working with

423
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:39,409
pinned up to be able to do the analytics

424
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:58,369
system how do we tie this and we're

425
00:28:52,859 --> 00:29:02,490
working with crappy which is a breeding

426
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:06,149
and pizzelle be who runs this community

427
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:10,440
is based here at Cornell and also at BT

428
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:11,970
I and reports and we're running this

429
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,269
under the excellence of breeding

430
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:17,910
platform this is a new platform that the

431
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:20,639
CG centers have funded from the villa

432
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,800
Melinda Gates to be able to consolidate

433
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,520
a lot of this research across the CG

434
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:30,089
centers and Kelly Robbins is leading

435
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:32,940
module five in that platform so we're

436
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:35,639
all about community and collaboration we

437
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:38,640
have members that go be within each of

438
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,530
the Institute's that we work with we do

439
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,470
a lot of training and cross-training

440
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:47,779
we also really strive to work very

441
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:47,779
closely with neighboring projects and

442
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:58,170
resources so let's look again at what is

443
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,529
needed to be able to do genomic

444
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:03,300
selection well and how well we are doing

445
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:06,059
in being able to implement genomic

446
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:07,740
selection these are the components that

447
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:10,418
we need reading management

448
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,149
high-throughput sampling and shipping

449
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:16,869
genotyping platform data management high

450
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:18,819
throughput analysis and api's the market

451
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:20,618
assisted selection you can get away with

452
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:28,210
just an Excel spreadsheet but if you

453
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:31,168
missed a genomic selection and this is

454
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:33,788
the state status in industry they have

455
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:37,778
invested over many years and all of

456
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:41,138
these systems a huge amount of resources

457
00:30:37,778 --> 00:30:43,210
that have been filled tens of years they

458
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:44,738
pretty much got everything in place and

459
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,808
they're still finding it hard

460
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:50,048
implement genomic selection it's not

461
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:53,798
easy for them and then in the CG centers

462
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:55,929
we're suffering from little bits of

463
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:57,730
money here and there one project to

464
00:30:55,929 --> 00:31:01,840
their system one project for another

465
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:03,878
system CG centers are not not all about

466
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,238
plant breeding they are there for the

467
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:08,769
greater good they're there to be able to

468
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:11,379
support the local communities and

469
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:13,210
sustain resources so plant breeding is

470
00:31:11,378 --> 00:31:16,538
only just a part of what they do and

471
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:18,429
they don't have many resources and those

472
00:31:16,538 --> 00:31:21,368
resources are spread across multiple

473
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:24,070
projects with multiple objectives so

474
00:31:21,368 --> 00:31:26,678
again excellence in breeding is trying

475
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:32,878
to focus these resources to develop

476
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:32,879
sustainable solutions

477
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,180
and we need to get our ducks in a row

478
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:42,400
for those systems because coming down

479
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:46,509
the road is a whole new suite of

480
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:49,540
technologies in terms of data analytics

481
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:52,000
and artificial intelligence on the farm

482
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:54,129
I just think it's amazing all of these

483
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,359
companies that are currently active in

484
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,280
this space there's gonna be a lot of

485
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:59,889
venture capital around to be able to

486
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:04,319
support this many companies very highly

487
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:07,330
saturated market precision analytics or

488
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:10,149
hybrid on the farm understanding your

489
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:27,579
marketplaces robotics and Jones sensors

490
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:46,840
smart irrigation based your AI

491
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:48,939
technology but we're also seeing a lot

492
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:53,139
of new information coming out of allele

493
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:56,350
mining where you look at the diversity

494
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:58,480
of alleles across across your species

495
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:00,879
and try and track them to a particular

496
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,700
geographic location or particular

497
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:10,810
phenotype and you can use that also to

498
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:14,230
understand your trades edit the DNA and

499
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:22,029
inject the mutation that we want and

500
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:24,819
we're seeing multiplex mutations it's

501
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:27,910
not very reliable yet but I'm sure it

502
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:29,799
will be soon and so now we can take all

503
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:40,140
of the information that we get through

504
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:40,139
AAA and Big Data and the lil mining and

505
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:55,419
Landscaping of reading in the future and

506
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:58,179
I'd say also I actually worked in IP

507
00:33:55,419 --> 00:34:01,149
when I was at pioneer for eight years I

508
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:05,860
know I was there and this is really

509
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:09,190
gonna change how IP lawyers and in the

510
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:11,440
era of genomics data they're really I

511
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:13,809
mean in genomics and genomic selection

512
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,480
there really wasn't a lot patent you

513
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:18,190
didn't have any unique sequences there

514
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,309
were method patents for the genomic

515
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:24,398
selection methodologies and there's

516
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:26,889
rampant method patents are hard to

517
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,739
police plant patents are only available

518
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:35,500
in the US I can just see these IP

519
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:38,289
lawyers salivating CRISPR with a

520
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:41,440
function that can be used to patent

521
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:42,969
materials globally and also that are

522
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,889
easy to please because you've got all

523
00:34:42,969 --> 00:35:11,230
those sequences there I can just see a

524
00:34:44,889 --> 00:35:16,119
sequence so that'd make my advanced add

525
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:19,179
slides I've stolen this one and so he

526
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:22,119
talks about reading 1.0 in a typical

527
00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:25,419
selection controlled traits 2.0 with

528
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:35,858
qtls we're here genomic selection and

529
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:40,740
3.0 and it's really gonna change how we

530
00:35:35,858 --> 00:35:44,730
do plant breeding in terms of discovery

531
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:48,319
but I believe that no matter how many

532
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:51,210
tools you have to be able to elucidate

533
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,000
during complexes and understand those

534
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:56,670
gene complexes using all this AAA and

535
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,920
machine learning we're still going to

536
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:02,940
struggle to be able to move those genes

537
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:07,380
into breeding material to keep up with

538
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:09,869
the parents election cycle unless we can

539
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:13,050
have CRISPR technologies that can

540
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:15,450
instantaneously mutate lines as they go

541
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:17,900
through that breeding cycle or unless

542
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:21,029
those traits are of extremely high value

543
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:23,160
the value of that continuous breeding

544
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:27,300
cycle is just not going to allow those

545
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:29,429
new cutie ELLs and however much we know

546
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:37,019
so I really think it's going to be a

547
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:39,929
combination of and that's because

548
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:46,650
biology isn't easy but more we look at

549
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:49,858
genetics and so we can have these new

550
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:52,650
tools and we can try and delve down into

551
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:55,099
the rabbit hole of that complexity but

552
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,099
in the end

553
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:09,150
[Applause]

554
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:30,529
how long we think the public

555
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:35,060
soo-ji centers are going to be able to

556
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:37,519
catch up here with industry I don't

557
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:54,320
think we'll ever catch up with industry

558
00:37:37,519 --> 00:38:16,759
I think we have to and I would say to

559
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:20,920
turn all of these faces Hunter is trying

560
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,920
to address that issue you mentioned

561
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:27,259
foundation because as sure that breeding

562
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:33,340
programs only have small markets our

563
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:33,340
project and wondering how for a fitting

564
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:41,719
we have to address the yield stagnation

565
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:46,660
problem but it's certainly not the only

566
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:46,659
component yield stagnation nitrogen

567
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:59,090
right that's another project that Gates

568
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:05,960
Foundation is funding and also security

569
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:09,079
is a massive issue in Africa the seed is

570
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:11,090
either counterfeit seed or it's just the

571
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:15,588
wrong cross was accidentally made it's

572
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:20,989
very very high rate just bad

573
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:23,268
and so by putting in seed purity quality

574
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:25,759
mechanisms which we're helping to do

575
00:39:23,268 --> 00:39:27,889
through our project that's going to make

576
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:30,259
huge advances just by itself and

577
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:32,118
improving yields and then genomic

578
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:36,458
selection to make that happen

579
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,459
and microsystem selection can also

580
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:35,579
we spend a lot of time going out in the

581
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:50,490
CG systems testing it to see if it's

582
00:40:35,579 --> 00:41:14,549
scalable right now we'll be sailing it

583
00:40:50,489 --> 00:41:16,739
right now we're building so one question

584
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:19,110
about the environments because a lot of

585
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:22,799
the breeding happens with giving climate

586
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:25,559
in soils and so a lot of you know when

587
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,870
we think about technologies being adult

588
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:29,759
in different countries and we think of

589
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:30,900
those transfers are in a genetic

590
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,570
material going from one place to another

591
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,400
one we don't necessarily control for the

592
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:38,340
environment in the other location so how

593
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,420
is the environment dealt with in this

594
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:44,960
system and you know how my question make

595
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:48,099
sense that is that clear enough

596
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,099
[Music]

597
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:58,720
that's handled by the plant breeders in

598
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:01,119
the CG centers to understand those

599
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:03,789
environments and where they need to be

600
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,890
testing materials in and any

601
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:08,139
environmental variation will become part

602
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:11,108
of the model of genomic selection as

603
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:13,558
well climate change so that was like I'm

604
00:42:11,108 --> 00:42:18,489
on a follow-up question so how is that

605
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:19,930
is this are these systems accounting for

606
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:22,750
that or is there a way that that can

607
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:25,449
come in through this relay - or they

608
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:27,280
kind of myopic in that sense all right

609
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:29,739
system right now in the environments

610
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,140
that they are in but drought tolerance

611
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:36,179
salinity tolerance very important traits

612
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:39,940
as well thank you as well as yield as

613
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:42,129
Pat fires predicting for the future

614
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:45,099
changes in environment I'm sure modeling

615
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:46,900
could have a role in that space to be

616
00:42:45,099 --> 00:43:53,170
able to incorporate that into future

617
00:42:46,900 --> 00:43:56,190
models experimental design it's very

618
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,190
simple to implement

619
00:43:56,610 --> 00:44:05,940
that is um thank you oh I was wondering

620
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:09,869
if you could speak a little bit more

621
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,490
about how you mentioned crisper will be

622
00:44:09,869 --> 00:44:14,159
integrated into the building project if

623
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:17,389
there's less emphasis on understanding a

624
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:19,769
machine architecture and the underlying

625
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:22,710
change that you need to really

626
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:33,059
understand the sequences to be fully

627
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:35,900
utilized right CRISPR is not but CRISPR

628
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:38,789
is very much being incorporated and

629
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:41,250
prioritized in industry breeding

630
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:59,940
programs because of the patent

631
00:44:41,250 --> 00:45:02,309
protection that it gives it wasn't part

632
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:14,340
of your talk tonight it was separate

633
00:45:02,309 --> 00:45:16,799
from thank you this has been a

634
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:21,590
