00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:10,209
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:10,210
University there are micro toxins there

00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,910
[Music]

4
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:26,348
ear rot in corn and this here right

5
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:26,349
produces monsen's so we're interested in

6
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:38,350
so they're more common and they're

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,070
linked to a variety of problems human

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,390
heal cancer childhood stunting and also

9
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:51,700
they're a big issue in livestock

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:54,859
especially the FDA regulates this range

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,170
2 to 4 parts per million for dates

12
00:00:54,859 --> 00:01:00,799
probably referencing the two parts to

13
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:03,890
William limit mostly and so here you can

14
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:10,459
see here right and these white streets

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:14,239
on the kernels he one is we comment a

16
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:15,889
toxic of johnson's this is a paranoia

17
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,479
that were sort of working the other

18
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:22,310
today is the idea that Kucera here

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,200
colonizes the kernels and causes the

20
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,549
kernels that colonizes to be less dense

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:33,560
and if you decrease density we think

22
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:35,959
that will be linked to an increase so

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,219
one way to mitigate commonness is and

24
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:49,250
they're sorting there's all sorts of

25
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:51,650
sorting methods such as size based

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,620
sorting such as screening out finds

27
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:57,728
which can be more toxic and also

28
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,260
spectral based sorting methods such as a

29
00:01:57,728 --> 00:02:03,679
Miraflores to detect sexual

30
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,580
characteristics why do we want to sort

31
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,920
well a breeder

32
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:08,599
I want a low-cost you know typing

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,490
alternatives

34
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:14,079
farmer might want to increase the value

35
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,080
of the crop and then

36
00:02:23,379 --> 00:03:07,659
so in our lab we can look at this

37
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:11,209
cartoon of how it actually functions

38
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:18,229
drop your unsorted maze drops one by one

39
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:21,680
a less dense kernel will be in your

40
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:24,439
reject bin where there's less terminals

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,020
which are typically more toxic or as

42
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:36,460
denser kernels are like more likely to

43
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:36,460
say so when especially efficiency

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,860
[Music]

45
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,360
specificity being the rate of true

46
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:50,509
negatives how are you doing it keeping

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,970
your good kernels and your sensitivity

48
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:56,569
your rate of true positives how are you

49
00:03:52,969 --> 00:04:00,770
doing at rejecting the benefits so to

50
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:04,009
calibrate this release we see 3d printed

51
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:06,590
plastic maze it's worth what started by

52
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:09,409
June shed speed a former masters student

53
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,659
in their lab and so on the top row we

54
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:16,459
had each color corresponding to a

55
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:19,339
different density we also sizes small

56
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:23,779
medium large and different shapes such

57
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:27,789
as vs. and they won't you all these

58
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:27,789
results but it can in fact

59
00:04:50,050 --> 00:06:00,860
we have and we three times we have the

60
00:05:21,918 --> 00:06:03,399
different fractions and I should point

61
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,229
out that if we're thinking of this as

62
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:08,899
trying to meet some legal limit it works

63
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:13,818
really are accepted fractions still have

64
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:15,679
the majority sniffles exceeding that so

65
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:17,629
I want to zoom in further to understand

66
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,060
at the single kernel level what's where

67
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:29,288
traits also single kernel traits that

68
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:32,209
could be related to monson and so it 72

69
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:35,718
accepted kernels and send me to rejected

70
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:37,848
kernels from one sample and measure the

71
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:40,899
mass which is very simple just by

72
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:40,899
placing it on a scale

73
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:53,508
more difficult it's complicated to

74
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:56,538
measure keep in Stuart in my first lab

75
00:06:53,509 --> 00:07:00,470
we helped a small device that takes 36

76
00:06:56,538 --> 00:07:04,788
pictures and then usually code from a

77
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:09,610
German group which is valued carving to

78
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:09,610
make a 3d reconstruction of the kernel

79
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:16,098
it's also interested in the visual

80
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:19,180
appearance and so I scored these kernels

81
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:19,180
based on their symptoms

82
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:31,669
finally material so now he's showing me

83
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:35,870
some histograms of each single kernel

84
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:38,718
characteristic and in single kernel

85
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:42,199
masks we have a significant decrease or

86
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:43,639
the dashed lines are V means of each so

87
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,319
I rejected fraction mean was

88
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,650
significantly lower than except the

89
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:53,590
fraction in terms of mass everyone

90
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:53,589
there's a lot of overlap between the two

91
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:59,870
similar volume there is a significant

92
00:07:57,408 --> 00:08:01,848
decrease in the rejected fraction the

93
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:08,658
rejected fraction kernels tended to be

94
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:11,959
smaller however however when you just

95
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:13,639
divide by volume to find density we

96
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,538
found no significant difference between

97
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,550
the density of the kernels each fraction

98
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:23,269
hustling based on the theory other

99
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,650
shorter however on that the distribution

100
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,079
is here much narrower than they were

101
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:30,968
from massive volume making it more

102
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,968
difficulty for a sorter to separate

103
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:41,740
other when we look at actually monastic

104
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:41,739
in our single set the transform values

105
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:52,129
which is a good thing and I also want to

106
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:53,588
point out higher than this to parts per

107
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:56,289
million

108
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:59,139
we're most concentrated in rejected

109
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:06,278
fraction and here we see it has some

110
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:07,810
false negatives median so I know if you

111
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:11,470
look at how each of these traits

112
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:13,599
correlated to log transformed function

113
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,720
and so if you directly attention to the

114
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,870
right hand column you see that for each

115
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,660
characteristic there was significant

116
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:26,549
only slightly negative correlations with

117
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:30,850
dress party monson indicating that

118
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:35,258
single kernels with higher few monofin

119
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:39,699
ended to be lighter smaller and less

120
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:41,860
dense and I finally wanted to look at

121
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:45,899
based on the single kernel data set how

122
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,899
well we were doing with the sorting

123
00:09:49,438 --> 00:10:11,259
predict accepted was our accept bid and

124
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:14,819
we found that negative 90 I mean when

125
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:14,818
we're starting we're getting a lot of

126
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:26,379
positives I wanted to compare this to

127
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:31,179
how just we do it so based on that

128
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:34,209
visual scoring right classifying one to

129
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:37,078
two visual score as except period for

130
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:40,619
visual stories we had similar

131
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:55,419
effectiveness comparing our machine to

132
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:58,240
sew and iris does indicate that visual

133
00:10:55,419 --> 00:11:05,078
characteristics of the maids is

134
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:06,669
important for all that being said I'm

135
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:09,589
working to integrate

136
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:17,659
these tools with other sorting methods

137
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:23,750
such as visual here I'm also interested

138
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:26,689
in using these tools on ear rot

139
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,370
resistant slow sight and thinking of

140
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,330
ways to use the drops or to enrich

141
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:33,799
samples of toxic overhauls and using

142
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:57,200
various tools to measure single Pro

143
00:11:33,799 --> 00:12:00,469
attributes so this has been a production

144
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,240
of Cornell University on the web at

145
