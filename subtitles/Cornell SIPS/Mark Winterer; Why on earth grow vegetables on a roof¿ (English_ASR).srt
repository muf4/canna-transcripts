everything in between

00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:59,549
including vegetables rooftop farms are

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:04,909
about ten percent of the work that we do

00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:04,909
the pilots need stop but it is far away

6
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:13,589
we have designed to build over the past

7
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:16,798
nine years and I'm thrilled to be here

8

so absolutely and I thought I had come

15
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:39,189
full circle and reentered when we

16
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:39,189
entered the food industry and I

17
00:02:39,870 --> 00:03:56,439
vegetables in this is a customer's up

18
00:03:04,599 --> 00:04:00,789
there in the habitat creation the air

19
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:04,509
filtration and I talk about how they

20
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:07,239
hold who's wise was a plant and I

21
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:11,620
remember the I knew of the day

22
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:15,039
and I was driving to work and I was so

23
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,160
excited it finally hit me and I fell

24
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,418
that's going to be a little celebrity

25
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:24,310

have about 15 to 20 slides and it does a

34
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,089
great job of answering these questions

35
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:54,750
has some great interviews and if I try

36
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:56,569
to get there and play it for you but if

37
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,910
we don't get there

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,760
this is Marcus warrants and Marco Soros

40
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:08,239
was the head chef of the vegetation

41
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:11,060
enhancing plastic which was a new

42
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,129
restaurant started by three men from the

43
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,819
construction industry so that no idea

44
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:19,550
about how to run a restaurant but they

45
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:23,120
did hire Marco who was a passionate chef

46
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:26,360
and you believe in trying to get the

47
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,930
freshest ingredients very proud of what

48
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:34,370
is cooking and agree that who was better

49
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:36,590
than fresh ingredients and he heard

50
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,410
about Eagle Street rooftop farm which

51
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:43,129
was one of the first roof hot part of

52
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:45,890
the US and Brooklyn and one night all

53
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:48,980
the stars align faculty that with Hank

54
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:52,310
my business partner without some kind of

55
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:55,580
event for at a bar and he was introduced

56
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:59,360
to work and why I was so excited to meet

57
00:06:55,579 --> 00:07:01,519
a company that actually build these this

58
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,490
is our first rooftop farm so we don't

59
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:08,479
bring Bruce part of the type of a green

60
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:11,870
room and he definitely pursued the

61
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:16,319
owners until they finally that yes in

62
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:21,329
the region hired us to build a roof

63
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,580
after their restaurant and suddenly my

64
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:26,908
business partner I recovered readers

65
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:29,329
right middle of the urban dagonet which

66
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:33,269
is definitely incredibly exciting and

67
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:36,180
unexpected developments inside our

68
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:39,329
company this was one of our first

69
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,999
projects and you're so concerned about

70
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:45,628
the complexity of the structural

71
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:47,669
engineer the waterproofing the Apple III

72
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:51,360
waterproof to make sure there are any

73
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:53,519
leaks we were concerned about knox

74
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,709
materials knowing that we're going to be

75
00:07:53,519 --> 00:08:01,438
growing edibles out there and we didn't

76
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:03,930
think too much about building those and

77
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:15,620
we didn't even think about applying for

78
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:18,228
permanent which because we didn't think

79

rotate this great secret out of you guys

project is what led to our multiple

projects which is what for the southern

people are great in turn it's incredibly

102
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:37,329
exciting project go back in 2009 the

103
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:40,028
building owners financed the building

104
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:43,750
the New York City Greenwood company cut

105
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:46,990
good grade and they got the help of any

106
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:51,250
event in apologia to do to build this

107
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:55,930
roof incredibly successful project

108
00:10:51,250 --> 00:11:02,009
enacted a generous and incredible amount

109
00:10:55,929 --> 00:11:06,578
of excitement of the chef who hired us

110
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:09,879
but they because they were because it

111
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:12,309
was financed by the building owner the

112
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:14,470
they weren't too big have a lot of

113
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:16,719
little thing to experience what they

114
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:20,379
were going on there how to distribute

115
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,470
the food and they slowly started

116
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:27,429
focusing their efforts on educational

117
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:30,610
programming to do what they're told me

118
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:33,899
is when they brought kids are there near

119
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:36,669
city would never been outside the

120
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,879
combined intensity I've never actually

121
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:43,509
seen vegetables growing and it's never

122
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:46,629
just always took for granted where their

123
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:49,419
food came from and to go out on a roof

124
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:51,899
and actually see vegetables growing out

125
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:55,509
of the ground as I don't think for that

126
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:59,519
and so that they really great

127
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:59,519
educational activity there and

128
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:12,838
[Music]

129
00:12:15,370 --> 00:13:28,759
at the end of the year they have scale

130
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:32,778
this is a full inner roof the whole

131
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:36,860
foods was less than after that size but

132
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:40,759
he also was able to take advantage of

133
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:44,159
opportunity burn this this rooftop farm

134
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:48,180
gave people the chance to farm

135
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:51,299
never had that chance for anywhere near

136
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:54,599
to the area and so people were happy to

137
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:57,628
do this for free and they in fact we

138
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,490
were able to get a team of mighty

139
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:05,550
river's to the farm and their crosstown

140
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:07,500
and they also have a great market a lot

141
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:15,870
of farmers markets that they sell

142
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:21,028
distribute to local food and they'll

143
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:24,990
have a violent CSA program but then I

144
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:28,500
realized that that itself just revenue

145
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:31,409
from selling vegetables still wasn't

146
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,438
enough to helping me try but they really

147
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:37,350
had more value than just the produce is

148
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:41,250
up and what they had was incredible

149
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:43,040
States and this picture is on Google

150
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,470
heading

151
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:50,009
but I think this fiction itself might

152
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:54,990
answer the question why grows vegetables

153
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:57,289
on a roof and it's the space when you're

154
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:00,690
in the city and in New York especially

155
00:14:57,289 --> 00:15:03,299
you're really stuck inside alive and

156
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:09,780
there's not a lot of open air and fresh

157
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:12,329
air to enjoy the environment and a bear

158
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:16,589
group is a fairly

159
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:19,830
unhospitable place a black we get 160

160
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:22,620
degrees in this summer and it's just not

161
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:25,320
a comfortable place to sit and eat but

162
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,690
when you put that up our minds at any

163
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:32,160
air temperature down to a much more

164
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:37,110
hospitable level and it creates this

165
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:41,819
beautiful open air or an oasis which you

166
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:44,639
don't have very much of in cities and as

167
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:47,520
our cities grow and they are all

168
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,629
projected to double in the next couple

169
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,360
of decades all those buildings are

00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:57,299
taking up all the green open states and

171
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,629
so what's left is a lot of group space

172
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:04,250
and how can you transform that through

173
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:10,710
space and and make it into a place to

174
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:14,169
enjoy like this and they're able to sell

175
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:17,560
these tickets these mental

176
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:19,899
that food the table dinner if this is

177
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:23,619
three or four years ago he told me

178
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:28,139
they're silent see for $75 apiece so

179
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:32,379
this is a big revenue channel for them

180
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:36,399
that help them become profitable and the

181
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:40,120
other really magical thing about open

182
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:43,958
air farm in a city weather isn't much

183
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,690
open airy space and they also elevated

184
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:49,629
to the street level and that makes a

185
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:52,440
world of a difference the pedestrians

186
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:57,820
the car they had a lot of really strong

187
00:16:52,440 --> 00:17:00,910
rush energy and it's stressful and to go

188
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:06,669
up a few stories to escape that street

189
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:11,230
level energy it is really create a nice

190
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:14,049
peaceful Oasis up there so I can add

191
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:18,730
this mediation up on that slide but I

192
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:21,699
still have 25 minutes they also do they

193
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:24,480
also do more than just those food table

194
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:26,870
events a at most weddings of their

195
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,509
that's what

196
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:31,908
they have funding from the Department of

197
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:34,579
Environmental Protection because it's a

198
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:37,028
way to manage stormwater which is kind

199
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:42,918
of nice pensive for cities to do

200
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:46,130
especially when it's very hard to build

201
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:49,309
an infrastructure under the streets to

202
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:52,100
manage on the stormwater they also

203
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:54,139
obviously have value-added products like

204
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:56,199
this hot sauce that they can make much

205
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:00,110
more money summer that's awesome and

206
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:02,240
they can adapt everything sucks whatever

207
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:05,089
I don't have a pair of t-shirts they

208
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,000
make a lot of money selling t-shirts so

209
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:11,178
they are really made was able to make

210
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,679
some money rooftop farming but it wasn't

211
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:15,980
just telling that vegetables themselves

212
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:23,600
it was really selling that the brand and

213
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:27,470
the space they created this project that

214
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:30,648
this is probably the most impressive my

215
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:35,809
high my favorite level for department of

216
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:40,909
business sense is astounded by

217
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:42,769
hey who's Lebanese where farming is very

218
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:46,279
personal to hear me because it's very

219
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:50,629
hard to farm in Lebanon and he told me

220
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:54,349
that cute understands the importance of

221
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:59,270
keeping populations and his mission is

222
00:18:54,349 --> 00:19:02,149
to to feed the population clean city

223
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:07,160
centers whether it isn't much apartment

224
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:09,430
so he was also a businessman wonderful

225
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:13,420
for any business model to be sustainable

226
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:16,670
it has to be financially sustainable so

227
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:19,130
when he's able to do here with this

228
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:22,130
greenhouse that that chance to network

229
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:26,390
arrange is grown twelve months out of

230
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:29,600
the year and he uses hydroponics inside

231
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:34,190
that big mouth and Hypertime field much

232
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:36,399
more produce that that soil does and he

233
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,400
has

234
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:43,240
vegetables and was handing out these

235
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:47,440
made us to prove that type of food

236
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:50,829
actually tastes good and it did such a

237
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,070
generic very sweet but we're hammer

238
00:19:50,829 --> 00:20:00,808
Mohammed rooftop farming is about food

239
00:19:54,069 --> 00:20:04,089
security and providing big city centers

240
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:08,408
this is the fossa Medical Center which

241
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:12,970
is a rooftop partly built in boxes and

242
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:15,450
they they they're they're not selling

243
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:19,230
these vegetables they are paying for

244
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:22,538
today for the insemination got a founder

245
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:27,640
attending auction to pay for the entire

246
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:30,009
process in stock and they hired farmer

247
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,030
to do all the farming and they give all

248
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:36,250
the produce to their low-income patients

249
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:39,359
it's part of a new method for doing

250
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:42,359
business or about holistic healing and

251
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,359
Timisoara

252
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:54,209
good healing it was healthy diets and so

253
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:57,440
there Boston Medical Center is trying to

254
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:00,509
bring that into their their equation

255
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,090
working with patients and giving them

256
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:06,808
healthy food as part of the healing

257
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:09,990
process the blossom Medical Center was

258
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:13,710
designed this Beach done what we did at

259
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:17,000
Fenway Park and this is family farms

260
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:22,350
which is what I finally built back in

261
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,798
2015 we were we were ready on opening

262
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:30,379
day which was able thirteen at that day

263
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,379
and a week before theirs

264
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:40,500
to get the vegetables time but they

265
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,549
their original interesting rooftop

266
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:47,700
farming was to show their sustainability

267
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:50,730
that we first reach out to us they said

268
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:54,029
eight is a great way to show our fans

269
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:57,200
that we care about the environment and

270
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:57,200
then Linda Henry

271
00:21:57,729 --> 00:22:02,889
she the only one that's right she is the

272
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:08,168
other way

273
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:13,218
Johnny and she got she is a urban

274
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:16,849
agricultural supporter and she wanted to

275
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:19,548
grow vegetables somewhere at Fenway Park

276
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:21,618
and she heard up

277
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:24,769
we were working either originally to

278
00:22:21,618 --> 00:22:27,648
make this one of those sedum extensive

279
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:29,838
more about stormwater management and she

280
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:34,088
said you can't even see them

281
00:22:29,838 --> 00:22:43,940
let's put food on Bethany Kenny and she

282
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:46,690
her husband is ready yvm the European

283
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,690
Socrates

284
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:56,099
[Music]

285
00:22:51,299 --> 00:23:01,599
Liverpool Socrates or the farm and apart

286
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:05,829
it was so it successful that here too

287
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:11,849
they extended yet see the difference

288
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:15,909
there that was 2015 and that was 2016

289
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:18,399
and what they realized they that farm

290
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:21,430
really transformed that states and

291
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,730
needed a beautiful shapes that people

292
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:28,150
wanted to be out enjoying so they cared

293
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:30,789
the second one that was occupied on this

294
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,120
first one is a wheelchair accessible so

295
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:35,609
technically the

296
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,099
but they wanted to allow the public to

297
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:45,409
go out there to enjoy that open-air

298
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:45,409
urban oasis and they miss their

299
00:23:49,549 --> 00:24:01,799
closeness be in number one secrets spot

300
00:23:54,299 --> 00:24:05,339
in Boston and whatever magical space of

301
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:12,960
who can be late the city of beautiful

302
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:15,599
views before we stop it that you can see

303
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,870
those plants really transfer on that

304
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,149
stage like 100 United States and you can

305
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:24,659
see there I'm afraid that's where all

306
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:27,200
the fans go the seating is on the farm

307
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:30,240
and you can see the lights here today

308
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,390
but these are on the losing section

309
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:47,390
standards are so you can see a lot of

310
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:50,500
people have access to that vegetables

311
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:54,530
black underutilized water food membrane

312
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:57,730
and interestingly they do this is

313
00:24:54,529 --> 00:25:01,879
incredible to me to give daily tours

314
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:05,360
seven days a week every hour limit of 50

315
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:08,740
people per tour every tourist sold out

316
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:13,069
they do it 365 days a year

317
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:16,190
and the bending part the number one sets

318
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:18,619
stop on a tour people come out they're

319
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,120
not expecting to see a vegetable there's

320
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:22,579
just jaw-dropping

321
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:26,659
when you're not expecting to see see

322
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:29,449
this and to see it and I think I think

323
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:32,990
it leaves little for exploration and

324
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:35,150
discovery and for seen things that

325
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:41,710
you're not expected to see and I think

326
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:41,710
that people really are impressed by that

327
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,240
people are attracted

328
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:53,428
example of that I would repeat remiss

329
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:56,130
not to talk about city grubbers that's

330
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:58,860
just a nickname from the left she bones

331
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:01,169
and running speed runners and that's why

332
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:03,629
people on the right he's the executive

333
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:06,360
chef at seven o'clock this would not

334
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:09,600
work without those two company without

335
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:12,798
those two organizations is incredibly

336
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:17,418
hard though it takes commitment

337
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:20,038
impatience and green city growers

338
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:22,470
defecating parties that do all that

339
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:26,069
farming without them this wouldn't be

340
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:29,130
successful and then Ronnie will plays a

341
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:31,678
critical role because he had the

342
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:36,480
challenge of actually cooking this food

343
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:40,980
and he is at the mercy of the weather

344
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,190
the harvest and he has to adjust menu to

345
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,680
whatever it is in season

346
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:49,519
being an artisan and that requires them

347
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,320
to be creative and flexible and you know

348
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,429
you can't just go in and do the same

349
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:55,339
thing

350
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:58,429
all day but that just keeps of that

351
00:26:55,339 --> 00:27:01,009
Patrick because he wouldn't told me he

352
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:04,249
wouldn't want to go into the kitchen the

353
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:07,128
same thing ever said that was born and

354
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:09,200
this farm it really excites it's

355
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:12,199
passionate to be able to use his

356
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,548
creativity and to work with the food

357
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:20,600
that is being harvested in public in

358
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:23,210
every time we just talks about food and

359
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:26,118
ingredients and what you can do with all

360
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:28,490
these different vegetables and it's

361
00:27:26,118 --> 00:27:30,798
doubly challenging for him not only does

362
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:34,099
he have to juggle the season in the

363
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:38,480
harvest but he also has a packed

364
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:42,888
schedule and when the team is on the

365
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:46,069
road and yet the apartment is tough for

366
00:27:42,888 --> 00:27:48,579
him to take advantage of whether it's

367
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:48,579
being harvested

368
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,828
