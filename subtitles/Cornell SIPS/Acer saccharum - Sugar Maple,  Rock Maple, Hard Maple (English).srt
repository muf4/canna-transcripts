00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,070
&gt;&gt; Acer saccharum or sugar maple is our native tree,

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,745
and it has five lobed, sharply lobed leaves.

3
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:12,989
The distinctive feature for sugar maple is the terminal bud,

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,445
which is very sharp.

5
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:15,690
You can put your thumb on it,

6
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:17,099
and you can draw blood.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,800
So, this is Acer saccharum, sugar maple.
