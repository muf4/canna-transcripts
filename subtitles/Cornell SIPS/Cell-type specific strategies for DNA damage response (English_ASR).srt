1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,839
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,439
University yeah I want to thank the

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,120
students for inviting me it's always

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,199
really an honor to be invited by the

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,118
students we never quite know why they

6
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,799
picked you but this is really great so

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,600
okay so today I'm going to talk to you

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,640
about responses to DNA damage and

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,920
responses to a an acute dose of heavy

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,560
DNA damage can go on for weeks but what

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,439
we're mostly going to focus on are these

12
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:34,079
immediate responses that happen in the

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,399
very same day as being hit by this acute

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,079
dose and these things have to do with

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,920
well this is tricky these these kind of

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,480
responses are really responses to the

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,520
damage that we're inducing Downstream

18
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,279
things have more to do with responses to

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,920
the responses you know some cells have

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,439
died things have to be replenished I'll

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,039
talk about that very briefly because I

22
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,718
my talk is probably too long

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,039
already okay so our model DNA damaging

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,920
agent which we're going to use through

25
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,799
at this talk at gamma rays just to make

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,118
it clear what gamma rays do the Rays

27
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,200
themselves do not probably induce many

28
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:11,799
double strand braks so these are photons

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,118
they zip right through the cell the

30
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,799
great majority of them are not even

31
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,079
going to interact with any of the matter

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,520
in the cell they're just going to go

33
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,319
right through but if one is lucky it

34
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,839
might interact probably with a water

35
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,959
molecule because that's most common

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,000
molecule in the cell it's going to spit

37
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,319
out through comptant scattering a very

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,599
high energy electron that electron can

39
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:34,239
travel quite far in the cell and if it

40
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,759
happens to come to a stop within the

41
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:39,959
cell it'll depend deposit all of that

42
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,319
energy in a little burst of reactive

43
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,599
oxygen species so this is really quite

44
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,919
an indirect effect but it's making

45
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,438
several different types of damage right

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,759
here and again most of the damage will

47
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:53,039
be to water because most of the cellular

48
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,519
components are water but if that little

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,079
burst happens to Lodge in the nucleus it

50
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:01,078
has a good chance of hitting the DNA and

51
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:04,478
the burst itself happens within a

52
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:07,078
certain radius which just by chance is

53
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,038
about the same as the radius of the DNA

54
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,400
so you'll get multiple damage to both

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:14,199
sides of the DNA and that means you

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,599
don't have a good template strand for

57
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:19,359
repair it's possible you could introduce

58
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:20,919
a break in the backbone to begin with

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,920
but also repair activities will

60
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:24,799
introduce double strand brakes and this

61
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,639
may take time for those braks to be

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,480
induced so things are going to happen

63
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,279
gradually so again the burst could have

64
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,598
been over here and you get single ided

65
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,759
damage or if the burst happened to be

66
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:37,799
right where a DNA molecule was you'll

67
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,799
get a double strand break

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,480
eventually all right now double strand

69
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,680
braks sound horrific but they actually

70
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:47,359
have very little biological significance

71
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,080
provided the cell doesn't divide so the

72
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,319
only point of having genes be connected

73
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,159
to a chromosome is if you're going to do

74
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:56,719
cell division again so the whole point

75
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:59,039
of being on a chromosome is to be

76
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,239
attached to a centrom if the cell

77
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,840
doesn't need to divide the DNA can still

78
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,920
replicate it can still do transcription

79
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
there's no problem there are many

80
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,439
origins of

81
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,719
replication um and everything can be

82
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:13,799
just fine it's only in the context of

83
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,158
cell division that you'd end up losing a

84
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,360
chromosome arm because there's no

85
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:20,318
Centere here and here in yeast you would

86
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,879
end up with a dead daughter cell because

87
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,560
you've lost a chromosome arm it's going

88
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:26,439
to carry something that's essential on

89
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,158
there so that's really bad news but as

90
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,639
long as cell division doesn't happen

91
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:34,840
dble break are not a

92
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:38,839
problem all right

93
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,560
so the immediate DNA damage response the

94
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,878
stuff that happens in the same day as

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,000
the DNA damage is to have some sort of

96
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:48,560
system for monitoring the presence of

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,680
damage and that system has to talk to

98
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,799
the cell and give it some good ideas

99
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,439
like arresting progression of the cell

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,319
cycle until that signal disappears maybe

101
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:00,959
inducing repair if that's something that

102
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,158
needs to happen both bacteria and UK

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,840
carats are extremely exquisitly

104
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,840
sensitive to the presence of double

105
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,360
strand brakes and in yeast of single

106
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,319
double St Brakes in a completely

107
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,000
unnecessary plasmid will prevent cell

108
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:17,639
cycle progression now yeast and other

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,199
single whoops single celled

110
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,400
organisms if they detect the presence of

111
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,400
a break for several days and it's clear

112
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,319
that it's never going to go away since

113
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,359
they're single single celled organism

114
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,000
they might as well give it a shot go on

115
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,038
with replication maybe the find they

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,319
didn't need that chromosome arm after

117
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:37,519
all in the daughter so right but um in

118
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,599
an animal that's a risky thing to do we

119
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,399
carry a a huge genetic load on our

120
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,400
chromosomes if we go from being

121
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:46,000
heterozygous for mutation on one of

122
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,638
those arms to uncovering that recessive

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,918
mutation it can easily lead to cancer we

124
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,879
have trillions of cells so in our case

125
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,839
rather than adapt to the presence of

126
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,439
double Stone brakes the cell would

127
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,959
decide to die or permanently arrest

128
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:04,079
instead so that it never undergo um DNA

129
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:07,959
sorry cell division and exposes that he

130
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:10,120
that um deleterious alil so the question

131
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,319
we're asking here is what about plants

132
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,160
do plants have the exact same issue as

133
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,000
single celled organisms or animals or

134
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,039
are they somewhere in

135
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,680
between all right so let's think about

136
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,719
it do we expect plants to have

137
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,680
programmed cell cycle responses to DNA

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,680
damage at all of course we do because

139
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,840
it's a very sensitive sensible thing to

140
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,038
do but let's just play devil's advocate

141
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:33,000
for a second here

142
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:35,519
plants are diploid and often polyploid

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,879
and they tolerate anupy well they have

144
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:41,279
backup copies of things in my case I'm

145
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:43,600
working with arabidopsis arabidopsis is

146
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,758
a self-pollinating organism so it's

147
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,639
homozygous for all low size so it's not

148
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,680
going to be exposing heterozygosity by

149
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,240
Le losing a chromosome arm because it's

150
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,000
already totally

151
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,918
inbred plant cells can't move so cancers

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,759
can't metastasize so even if you messed

153
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:00,879
up the regulation of the cell cycle in a

154
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,319
single cell you might end up with a

155
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,360
tumor on a plant but You' rather you'd

156
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,800
probably not end up with death and again

157
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,759
in case of arabidopsis we have a 10we

158
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,240
life cycle anyway really doesn't matter

159
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,960
plant development is extremely flexible

160
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,639
so if some cells are messed up and

161
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,239
starting to take off on their own and

162
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,840
there aren't many examples of them ever

163
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,840
doing this you know you know viruses or

164
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:25,719
bacteria can reprogram cells that cells

165
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,038
rarely ignore the signals from other

166
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,880
cells so this is an example of the

167
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:34,800
flexibility of plant um growth in that

168
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:38,199
you can take a fig tree in this case a

169
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,478
ficus and you can turn it into boards

170
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,560
and you can pound them into the ground

171
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,120
and staple barb wire to them and if

172
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,800
there's any living tissue still in the

173
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,079
board it'll make another tree right so

174
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,120
animals don't do this but plants can

175
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,439
easily do this sort of thing so they can

176
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,319
work around a lot of problems now still

177
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,680
why not do cell cycle arrest well the

178
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,240
reason not to is plants compete for

179
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,800
resources only through growth animals

180
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,478
don't do that they can run around and

181
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,199
compete for resources the plant if these

182
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:07,918
plants two little seedlings are going

183
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,199
next to each other and they're competing

184
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,279
for light if one gets bigger than the

185
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,840
other even transiently it'll overshadow

186
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,399
the other and have an exponential

187
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,679
advantage that will never stop it's a

188
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,839
little like uncontrolled capitalism

189
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,800
right if you don't have government

190
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,239
regulations in place as soon as one

191
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,319
person gets Rich he can dominate all the

192
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:32,199
others so in this case sorry yeah

193
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,879
plants have to worry about growth rate

194
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:37,639
versus genetic Purity you know which is

195
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,879
really a more important issue so this

196
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,000
immediately leads us to think about

197
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,439
sematic versus germline cells maybe it's

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,918
okay to grow like mad and ignore genome

199
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,120
Fidelity as long as you're outpacing

200
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,878
your competitors but the germ line

201
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,918
perhaps is something you don't want that

202
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,240
to happen in and unfortunately I'm not

203
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,279
going to be talking about the germline

204
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,158
in this talk at all because it's harder

205
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,279
to look at than the root tip so instead

206
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:02,918
I'll talk a little bit about

207
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,038
meristematic versus terminally

208
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:06,839
differentiated cells and how their

209
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,000
responses might be

210
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:12,038
different all right so do double strand

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,680
braks occur at all in nature there's no

212
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:16,639
natural source of radiation that plants

213
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,800
really have to worry about the kind of

214
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,000
doses I'm using are enormous you're even

215
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,319
if you growing plants in Chernobyl where

216
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
they grow just fine they wouldn't get

217
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,479
this sort of

218
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,360
dose all right so double strand breaks

219
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:34,439
are generated during DNA replication

220
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,240
quite frequently so these are

221
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,479
single-ended double strand braks due to

222
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,440
breakage of a replication fork so larger

223
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,600
genomes will have bigger problems with

224
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,440
this sort of issue and here's an example

225
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,399
of what I'm talking about if you have a

226
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,080
replication fork and there's maybe a

227
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,919
single-sided you know a lesion just one

228
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,320
base DNA pmer is very fastidious and it

229
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,679
doesn't want to replicate past that it's

230
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,320
going to leave single stranded DNA on

231
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,759
both of these sides and that is a very

232
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,959
fragile thing and so it's quite likely

233
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:09,000
for one of these branches to break off

234
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,319
right this is essentially in a complete

235
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,360
chromosome that's fine but this is a

236
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,640
chromosome that has a break and nothing

237
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,039
to rejoin it to so that's a single-ended

238
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:22,240
break so every round of replication this

239
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:25,078
probably happens in every cell right in

240
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,560
a rabid opsis a genome size is 130th the

241
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:28,479
size of maze so I would think it would

242
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,119
happen 30 times more often in maze than

243
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,120
in a rabbit op

244
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:37,399
double Str breaks can also be generated

245
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,278
naturally during desiccation and

246
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:43,159
rehydration and I don't mean drought I

247
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:45,519
mean desiccation when biological tissues

248
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:48,399
reach you know air levels of humidity

249
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,320
they're just left out to dry out and

250
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,759
animals most animals cannot withstand

251
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,360
desiccation but some funy can and plants

252
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,759
can seed plants do it every generation

253
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,600
in the seeds sometimes pollen is

254
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,399
desicated tolerant and some kinds of

255
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,159
pollen are not so this is another

256
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,320
example of where double strand braks

257
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,120
could be generated substantially in the

258
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,720
genome and of course bigger genomes just

259
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,278
because they have more DNA have a

260
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,519
greater probability of getting a double

261
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,799
strand

262
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,240
break and is this damage acute so we're

263
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,639
throughout this talk going to be talking

264
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,440
about acute damage right slam the plant

265
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:25,759
with gamma radiation then I look at its

266
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,040
recovery rather than leaving it to grow

267
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:31,120
on something that induces double strand

268
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:33,599
braks damage to seeds acute it depends

269
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,399
whether you believe that seeds in their

270
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,879
desiccated cryptobiotic state are

271
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,559
actually still metabolically active in

272
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,000
repairing things but there is an older

273
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,078
literature about the fact that seeds if

274
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,879
you watch them germinate they will

275
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,879
undergo what's called unscheduled DNA

276
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,799
replication which means that all of the

277
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,480
cells are doing a little repair here and

278
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,278
there and once that period is done then

279
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,039
the seed will actually proceed with cell

280
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,078
division and it won't do that so it

281
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,159
seems to be cleaning up its genome at

282
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:05,439
the beginning of replic of germination

283
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,559
after it's emed and then it goes on with

284
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,920
its life so it's a little like suffering

285
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,479
an acute dose of DNA damage it suddenly

286
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,799
a wakens to the fact that it has

287
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,519
accumulated DNA damage all right our

288
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,120
model system is the Rabbid opposite

289
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,639
seedling it has highly stereotypical

290
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,320
development we know what all the cells

291
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,600
are doing pretty well has lots of eally

292
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,240
visualized cell types and has a variety

293
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,278
of cell cycle modes so if we look at

294
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,720
this young Arab Ops of

295
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,879
seedling the different cells are doing

296
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,360
different things and this is a plant

297
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,240
audience mostly so I can go through this

298
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,360
pretty quickly there's an apical marem

299
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,278
here and an apical meristem down here

300
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,320
and both of these regions are rapidly

301
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:48,720
dividing and there's sort of a stem cell

302
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,440
Niche that's creating all these new

303
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,839
cells those are mitotic cells now unlike

304
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,079
animals there's also a lot of endid

305
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,360
duplication so all of the growth of the

306
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:01,719
hypoc cotle after germination is through

307
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,079
expansion of cells not cell division and

308
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,040
so those are becoming Ender duplicated

309
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,879
undergoing S phase but not mphase and

310
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,838
the cells are getting bigger and bigger

311
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,559
same thing in the zone of elongation in

312
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,760
the root after they're done being

313
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,359
mitotic the cells will start to expand

314
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,879
and increase the copy number of the DNA

315
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,600
without undergoing cell division and

316
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,120
then there's

317
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,920
differentiation um sort of after that

318
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,000
expansion is done so we are looking at

319
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:31,000
all kinds of different cell cycles when

320
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,958
we radiate these seedlings every single

321
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,240
cell is getting the exact same dose of

322
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,359
brakes right the radiation as I said

323
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,759
goes right through there's no higher

324
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,440
dose to outside cells than inside cells

325
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,679
everything's getting the same

326
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,519
dose but there the cells have different

327
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,239
Destinies and so they might have

328
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,839
different responses to DNA

329
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,879
damage all right do plants exhibit

330
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,959
program responses to DNA damage and of

331
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:00,039
course yes I wouldn't be talking here

332
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,958
and um how first the questions more

333
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:04,240
intellectual questions to ask are how do

334
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:08,078
you know a response is programmed rather

335
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,720
than just a Toxic effect for instance if

336
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:14,000
you if you expose a plant to Drought you

337
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,759
might see it Wilt you might think poor

338
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,759
Plant it's suffering from drought but it

339
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,120
is in a way undergoing a programmed

340
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,559
response to that drought it's dropping

341
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,159
its leaves so it's not picking up as

342
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,198
much sun as it used to it's doing this

343
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,759
intentionally so we're trying to

344
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:28,319
distinguish between intentional

345
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,600
responses which we call programmed and

346
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,600
toxic inevitable effects of ionizing

347
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,079
radiation then for the programmed

348
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,920
responses we'd like to know how they're

349
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:39,159
regulated and we want to know what their

350
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:42,198
biological significance is

351
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:44,078
to all right so most cases we will be

352
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:46,838
radiating seedlings but sometimes we

353
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,838
irradiate seeds so this is the mature

354
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,639
embryo of a rabid opsis inside of its

355
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,759
seed it has two calans it has a root but

356
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,560
it has no true leaves no visible true

357
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,759
leaves at all there's a meristem that

358
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:01,278
will divide to give true

359
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:03,959
leaves so if you radiate at this stage

360
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,759
for wild type seeds we look a couple

361
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,319
weeks later we have plenty of true

362
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,000
leaves who can spot them with their Leaf

363
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,360
hairs 100 Grays basically no effect on

364
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,559
growth this is a dose that is about 30

365
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,919
times the dose that would kill a person

366
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:22,719
um but the genome size is 130th that of

367
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,599
a human genome size right but this is

368
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,199
you know clearly it's not a lethal dose

369
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,519
at all it has no effect on growth if

370
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:32,399
irradiated as seeds now if we take that

371
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,000
up to 500 gray which is about 150 double

372
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,679
strand breaks per diploid G1 genome we

373
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,679
actually see miniaturization of

374
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,359
everything the calines everything that

375
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,239
was in the embryo is alive it's

376
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,720
gravitropic it's

377
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,159
phototropic um but it's not growing and

378
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,759
the cells are miniaturized they're also

379
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:56,559
not expanding so is that a Toxic effect

380
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,959
or programmed effect I can't tell

381
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,758
you another thing we can look at that's

382
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:03,039
an effect of ionizing radiation is

383
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,320
mutagenesis so we have this assay for

384
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:08,278
mutagenesis where we have a boster

385
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,240
resistant knockout of an Al that cause

386
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:14,039
causes albanism so we can select for

387
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,240
heterozygotes they have to be green and

388
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,000
they have to be Bost resistant and then

389
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,919
we can irradiate those seeds and ask

390
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,839
what the rate of sectoring is and the

391
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:25,679
rate of sectoring if you don't irradiate

392
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,199
the the seeds is zero you can't look it

393
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,318
enough to to find those sectors but if

394
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:33,318
you r them you can produce these sectors

395
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:35,639
that reflect chromosome loss breakage I

396
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:37,838
don't know what it's a very large broad

397
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,839
net that catches all mutations at this

398
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,360
Locus and it maxes out at about 4% of

399
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,839
plants because the plants get smaller

400
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,879
and smaller and smaller and smaller

401
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,600
until you can't look at sectors

402
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,679
anymore as part of their programmed DNA

403
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,360
damage response but that sectoring

404
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:55,638
mutagenesis itself it's hard to believe

405
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,399
that's a programmed response that is a

406
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,360
Toxic effect of ionizing radiation now

407
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,318
you think cell death would also be a

408
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Toxic effect of ionizing radiation but

409
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:06,958
the reason you die from five Grays of

410
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,919
radiation is not

411
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,479
because your epithelial intestinal

412
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:15,240
lining is especially sensitive to ioning

413
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,879
radiation it's because it's a sensitive

414
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,959
to the response to destroy itself in

415
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,720
response to ionizing radiation so you

416
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:25,119
Slough off your EP all your epidermal

417
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,000
cells similarly here if we look at

418
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,480
plants we radiate the whole root tip

419
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,120
everybody gets the same dose but we get

420
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,039
death not entirely just you know I can

421
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,959
see a dead cell here Pi staining

422
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:38,439
indicates that the cells can no longer

423
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,559
pump out pi and so they they start to

424
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,759
glow and you might say well maybe this

425
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,518
is a highly mitotic population that

426
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,519
makes it more sensitive because it's

427
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,919
running through the cell cycle faster

428
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,720
but if we look at the mitotic population

429
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:55,198
using cyclin b11 gfp as a marker we see

430
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,759
that this whole mass of cells here is

431
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:01,159
highly mitotic and um they're not all

432
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:05,038
dying it's instead focused on the stem

433
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:06,439
cells for the steel of the room here all

434
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,838
right which suggests that it's a

435
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:12,360
programmed response rather than a toxic

436
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,879
response another thing that cells um

437
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:18,038
root tips do in response to radiation is

438
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,360
here's a root tip growing 4 days old 8

439
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:22,038
days old here's a root cap you can't see

440
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,519
any root hairs because they're farther

441
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:27,400
up the

442
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:29,798
root if you hit them with ionizing

443
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,960
radiation 4 days later you can start to

444
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:34,319
see root hairs as differentiation

445
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,880
approaches the root tip the root tip has

446
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,639
stopped dividing and stopped growing

447
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,840
away from the differentiating Zone it's

448
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,559
coming down at 8 days all the cells have

449
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:44,678
become really massive and huge the

450
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,038
entire root tip has swollen up their

451
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:50,038
root hair is everywhere because there's

452
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:52,720
no cell division and the root tip is not

453
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:55,839
growing away from this differentiation

454
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,480
zone right so we you could say that this

455
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,319
is premature and red duplication

456
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,120
differentiation or you could say it's

457
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,759
just waiting for differentiation to

458
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,759
catch up with

459
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:11,119
it um another cute phenotype is this if

460
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:13,678
we look at this DNA repair mutant xpf

461
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:15,879
that's defective in a flap

462
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,120
endonuclease we irradiate these plants

463
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:23,159
as seeds wild type is not sensitive to

464
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:26,158
this dose the DNA repair mutant

465
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,080
is these calans are still undergoing

466
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:31,159
cell division there's not a lot of cell

467
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:34,240
division in a Cod naturally but there's

468
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:36,720
um there's the formation of stamata for

469
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,319
example that's all post emion and that's

470
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,400
still occurring those cell divisions are

471
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,519
still occurring but these cell divisions

472
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,759
to make leaves are not and so again that

473
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,879
suggests it's a programmed response some

474
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,079
cells are undergoing arrest or death

475
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,120
other cells are

476
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,798
not okay so how do we know which

477
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:57,119
responses are due to DNA damage because

478
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,279
ionizing uh radiation affects everything

479
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,439
in the cell and how do we know which

480
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,558
responses are programmed versus Direct

481
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,798
effects well to look at the

482
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,440
responsibility of DNA damage we can't

483
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,158
quite do that directly but we can do a

484
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,279
fairly convincing

485
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:15,200
experiment where what we do is look at

486
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,599
mutants that are defective in endtoend

487
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,000
non- holics end joining of double strand

488
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,480
brakes so in a G1 cell this is what's

489
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
doing the bulk of the DNA repair the

490
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,400
ends are simply religated together it's

491
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,679
a reasonably error free process so long

492
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,240
as the ends haven't been

493
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:36,640
reected there is also um this Gene which

494
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,679
I mentioned before xpf which is a flap

495
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,720
Ender nucleas and is sometimes required

496
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,840
for some types of nonhomologous end

497
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,759
joining all right so we can look at

498
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:48,439
these and we can ask if you're defective

499
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,400
in doubl strand brake repair do you

500
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,720
mimic the effects of ionizing radiation

501
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,919
at a lower dose you know in the mutant

502
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,240
that any phenotype you see is due to

503
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,679
this deficiency and therefore due to

504
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,079
double Strone

505
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,000
breaks so for example if we look at a

506
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,158
DNA liase 4

507
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,480
mutant at Zer gr of radiation it's wild

508
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:11,440
type at 100 gr of radiation when

509
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,919
radiated as seeds it makes this

510
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,960
miniaturized tiny Calen Little Seedling

511
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,600
that's not going to grow again and this

512
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,558
mimics the effects of 500 gr of

513
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,599
radiation all right

514
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:28,879
similarly at only 20 Grays of radiation

515
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:31,000
before we looked at 100 wild type

516
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,159
is very slow to induce any cell death in

517
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,079
the root tip it's not particularly

518
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:39,000
focused there either but if we look at D

519
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,279
lagus 4 at 20 gr we can see within four

520
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,640
hours there starts to be self death so

521
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,158
this is also apparently a response to

522
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,880
double strand breaks doesn't mean it's

523
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:48,640
programmed but it's a response to double

524
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,080
strand

525
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,480
breaks and interestingly different kinds

526
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,038
of persisting DNA damage can induce

527
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,240
different effects on growth so I just

528
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,558
talked about xpf having this lovely

529
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,558
phenotype that we call the gamma

530
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,918
plantlet in which everything is normal

531
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,079
you know hypoc codal development is

532
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,640
normal Calene development is normal but

533
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,599
you're just not getting true leavs as

534
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,559
opposed to DNA lagus for at the same

535
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,119
dose which has this highly miniaturized

536
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,599
seedling there's no dose of gamma

537
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,479
radiation where we can get lag four to

538
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:23,038
look like this right so it's not just a

539
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,759
matter of degree right by the time the

540
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,480
calans look this good we have true

541
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:31,079
leaves also and so this is a response to

542
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,240
something that's a very potent signal

543
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:36,278
for telling these cells to not divide

544
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,319
whereas this is a response to something

545
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:41,839
that's making all cells

546
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,599
miniaturized and inhibiting growth right

547
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,678
again this differential sensitivity of

548
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,000
these cells versus these cells again

549
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,038
these still have cell division they

550
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,038
still forming a stamata suggests that

551
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:54,278
this is a programmed

552
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:55,720
response all right so we felt so

553
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:57,640
strongly that this was a programmed

554
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,720
response that Sasha PR was willing to

555
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,720
undergo go a genetic screen to look for

556
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,038
Regulators of this so if it's a

557
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,919
programmed response there must be

558
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,038
something that's telling the cell here's

559
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,960
a break this is what you should do in

560
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,519
response to it or whatever it is that

561
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,840
xpf is repairing right so he took the

562
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:17,319
xpf

563
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:19,519
line and he mutagenized seeds with EMS

564
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,798
and he treated them actually with 100

565
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,599
Grays and then he looked for plants that

566
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,319
could grow in spite of the fact that

567
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,319
they've been irradiated so he's looking

568
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,480
for true Leaf production and he found

569
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:31,278
several mutant

570
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,159
and one of them was SOG one you can see

571
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:36,558
the leaves are not great but the phoxy

572
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,600
is normal and the the time at which

573
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,359
they're produced is normal so the leaves

574
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:44,119
are struggling but they're still

575
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:46,439
emerging so they've lost the ability to

576
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:47,719
induce probably a checkpoint in the

577
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,120
apical

578
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:55,960
marem and SOG one as Tomo discovered is

579
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:59,639
also defective in this program cell de

580
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:02,960
so if we look at sag one at 04 and 8

581
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,159
hours after radiation Sagan has no cell

582
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,360
depth it's not sensitive to ionizing

583
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,000
radiation in the way it's resistant

584
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,439
again because this is a programmed

585
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
response and Sagan tells you it's a

586
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,840
programmed response this is not

587
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
happening it's not a Toxic effect it's

588
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:21,319
something the cells are doing

589
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,200
intentionally and just as to be entirely

590
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:26,960
forthcoming with you if we go to the

591
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,558
next day and we look at Sagan mutants we

592
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,038
do see cell death so here's wild type 24

593
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:36,558
hours you see this Focus cell death

594
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,720
here's SOG you see this checkerboard

595
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,240
cell death instead it hasn't got the

596
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,240
focus and same thing we go to 48 hours

597
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,038
we see continuing cell death so this is

598
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,240
so one independent cell death I don't

599
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,879
know if it's programmed or not right

600
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,720
this is clearly programmed and stuff at

601
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,600
the earlier time

602
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,159
points all right so if losing SOG one is

603
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,319
so great for the plant because it

604
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,640
doesn't have cell death and it can go on

605
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:01,918
and divide in spite of radiation what is

606
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,200
San for well it's the same thing any

607
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,759
checkpoint protein is for is to prevent

608
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,558
um the accumulation of mutations so if

609
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:13,720
we radiate seeds again with that albino

610
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:17,119
pale green marker and we look for

611
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:22,278
sectors here's wild type

612
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:24,239
xpf xpf plus SOG and just SOG by itself

613
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:26,240
so this is suggesting that Sagan is

614
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,038
really important for minimizing

615
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,038
heritable DNA damage induced by ionizing

616
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:35,278
radiation so it can control chromosomal

617
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,759
stability it does this by inhibiting

618
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,839
progression of the cell cycle I haven't

619
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:41,319
showed you all this data it switches

620
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:44,038
cells from a mitotic to Ender duplicated

621
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:45,839
cell cycle so again as long as you are

622
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:47,440
not doing cell division double St breaks

623
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,000
are not a

624
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,440
problem and it induces cell death in

625
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,440
dividing meristematic

626
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,480
cells all right so the isolation of

627
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,798
mutants defective in these responses es

628
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,399
indicates that they're programmed

629
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:06,679
responses rather than toxic effects of

630
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:09,879
radiation all right so car yoshiyama was

631
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,440
postto in the lab and she mapped SOG and

632
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,600
figured out what Gene it was and it

633
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,399
turned out to be a transcription factor

634
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:19,398
a nact domain family protein it has a um

635
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:22,558
single amino acid change from a glycine

636
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:26,678
that's entirely conserved in all 100 NAC

637
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:29,278
domain proteins and rabid opsis to an

638
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,120
arginine

639
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,278
right and it looks like um unfortunately

640
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,798
you know we would love to be able to go

641
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,599
to NIH and say we're going to look for

642
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:40,200
SG mutants in humans or something but

643
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,079
this nact domain family does not exist

644
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,720
outside the Plant World in fact it only

645
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,960
exists in land plants and if I want to

646
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,278
really go out on a limb I could say that

647
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,679
you couldn't become a land plant without

648
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,240
SOG because it's important for response

649
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,080
to desiccation but that's really pushing

650
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,440
it okay anyway you can find homologues

651
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:02,558
of sog as opposed to other nacom main

652
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,200
proteins in related angiosperms so they

653
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,960
have more closely related genes to SOG

654
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,240
than to the next nact domain protein in

655
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,640
a rabid opsis so they probably are all

656
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,798
carrying this response but it hasn't

657
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,559
been shown at all now sogg itself is not

658
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,720
transcriptionally induced by ionizing

659
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,599
radiation it's always present and that

660
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,120
makes sense for the master regulator

661
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,439
it's going to be at the top of the chain

662
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:26,239
has to be present to detect the DNA

663
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,759
damage so how does it do

664
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,798
that well damage sensors are conserved

665
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,319
among UK carots and they're two classes

666
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,879
and sometimes they trade off some

667
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,798
functions but you can distinguish

668
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,200
between them pretty well there's

669
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:43,038
ATM uh which detects double string

670
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,960
brakes directly with the help of other

671
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:48,798
factors and there's

672
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,120
ATR which slightly indirectly detects

673
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,558
persisting single stranded stretches of

674
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:56,199
DNA not single strand braks but single

675
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:59,038
stranded dnas uses these factors to do

676
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,319
that both of these um sort of touch the

677
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,519
lesion before becoming activated then

678
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:06,918
this is in mammals there's a check one

679
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:09,519
and check two kinases these don't exist

680
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,720
in plants at all so plants have the

681
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,879
detectors don't necessarily have the

682
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,839
same connections but when you get down

683
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,960
to the regulation of the cell cycle

684
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:21,558
itself of course they do share some

685
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,558
factors and we1 is one of

686
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:28,038
those all right so for instance this

687
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,080
gamma plantlet formation

688
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:31,679
which these are all radiated seeds

689
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,199
here's wild type it's resistant to

690
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,240
radiation here's xpf making a lovely

691
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,080
gamma plantlet here's xpf SOG making

692
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:43,759
these sort of crappy looking true

693
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:46,079
leaves if we look at ATM ATM still has

694
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,158
the arrest so ATM is not required for

695
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,519
that

696
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,200
arrest if we look at ATR mutant we get

697
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:56,159
the true leaves back again and they look

698
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,120
a lot better than SOG too so ATR is

699
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,159
apparently detecting whatever lesion it

700
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:03,278
is that xpf is leaving behind in the

701
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,600
cell ATM is not required for that ATR is

702
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,880
absolutely required and in fact we1 is

703
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:10,839
also required for the detection so this

704
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,399
is probably some kind of replication

705
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:17,158
block and we1 is part of that pathway

706
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:17,158
responding to

707
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,319
that okay so so one is a transcription

708
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:24,199
Factor so does a Rabbid opsis have a

709
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:27,038
transcriptional response to ionizing

710
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,759
radiation so with this experiment is to

711
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:32,599
take day old seedlings irradiate Not

712
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,278
seeds but seedlings um with 100 Grays

713
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,079
which is a dose that slows them down a

714
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:39,119
little but then they all can recover

715
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:43,759
from that dose and look at the entire

716
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:46,599
transcriptome 1.5 3 6 12 24 hours which

717
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,558
is presented on a timeline across here

718
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:51,678
and the red bars are genes that are

719
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:55,558
repressed and green bars are genes that

720
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:58,038
are um I'm sorry red is induced and

721
00:28:55,558 --> 00:29:00,398
green is repressed and this has been

722
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:01,919
sorted by the computer into similar

723
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,558
expression

724
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,159
patterns so there are hundreds of genes

725
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:10,480
that are induced and Peak between about

726
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:13,200
1 and 3 hours right here there are also

727
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,240
hundreds of genes that are s suppressed

728
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,600
and that maximum suppression is about at

729
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,399
nine nope sorry 6 hours six hours and

730
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:22,599
these include transcripts that promote

731
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,798
cell cycle

732
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:26,639
progression and then there's this little

733
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,119
cluster of genes that are induced at 12

734
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,440
hours also

735
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,599
all right so is this a response to

736
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,679
double St breaks or is this a response

737
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:35,678
to damage to other cellular components

738
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,320
it could be

739
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,240
both if we look at the list of genes

740
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:44,480
that are induced the most highly induced

741
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,720
genes and these are all on apy chips the

742
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,919
fold induction for genes like Brea one

743
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,880
which are extremely repressed under

744
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:53,360
normal conditions in the cell is highly

745
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,559
variable when you do the experiment

746
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,879
depending on how you process the data

747
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:58,558
from the chips and where you draw the

748
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,640
line about about background levels of

749
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,359
expression so I don't know that this is

750
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,759
really induced 581 fold and it's

751
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:08,519
certainly not two to the 581 we're just

752
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,440
talking about 581 fold all right so if

753
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,399
you look at this you can see Wild type

754
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,720
is inducing these genes to these degrees

755
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:17,479
and if you look at the list of genes and

756
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,000
you happen to know anything about um DNA

757
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,839
metabolism you can see that they're all

758
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,278
DNA metabolism

759
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:27,439
genes all right ATR mutation has no

760
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:29,759
effect on the induction of those genes

761
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,080
ATM is critical for the induction of

762
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,640
these genes so at this time point in

763
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:37,278
response to gamma radiation ATM is

764
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,000
driving the induction of this cluster

765
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:43,440
this little red cluster of

766
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,599
genes okay all right so if we then go

767
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,558
ahead and expose the ATM mutant you can

768
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:51,000
see that a lot of this response is still

769
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:54,398
going on but not this

770
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,480
cluster so ATM that's the double strend

771
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:59,839
break response because ATM is a double

772
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,278
Brak detector you can see that we're

773
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,720
still getting repression of the cell

774
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:07,759
cycle and that's because if we look at

775
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:10,120
Gene by Gene basis ATM and ATR both play

776
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:14,038
semi- redundant roles in that response

777
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:16,439
so this is ATR driven in an ATM

778
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,919
background okay so what about SOG SOG is

779
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,440
a transcription Factor what does it

780
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:24,240
regulate in this response and what C

781
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:27,759
found is that it regulates everything so

782
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,599
for this little cluster again of genes

783
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:33,558
SOG one is essential for its induction

784
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,719
so um so one must be a transcription

785
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,319
factor that doesn't bind to every one of

786
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,120
these promoters but perhaps binds to the

787
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,200
promoters of transcription factors that

788
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:46,000
then bind to the promoter of

789
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,600
these so soan is remarkably important

790
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,880
for this

791
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:53,480
response all right and how does San work

792
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,600
um K had a paper published recently she

793
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:00,360
went on to work on this Sagan had um um

794
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,000
we knew that it had a SQ Motif a couple

795
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:05,879
of them that were highly predicted to be

796
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,960
regulated by both ATM and ATR so what

797
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,440
our model is is ATM is induced by a

798
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,679
double strand break it becomes an active

799
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,759
kise and it activates the activity of

800
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:19,919
pre-existing San protein and this goes

801
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:23,119
on to induce other effects

802
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,080
too okay and um again if you're

803
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,839
interested you can see K's paper

804
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:30,319
here

805
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,439
all right so we talked a little bit

806
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,200
before about what relevance does

807
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,320
ionizing radiation have for plant

808
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,000
biology at all because obviously plants

809
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:41,960
have a lovely programmed response to it

810
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,960
but it's never encountered in nature so

811
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,759
something that DNA repair people like to

812
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,000
say in the literature is for instance

813
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:51,278
any conventional stress induces reactive

814
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,119
oxygen species and that induces DNA

815
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:55,558
damage and this is probably important

816
00:32:53,119 --> 00:33:00,000
for response to stress but if you

817
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:02,960
actually use this stress this DNA damage

818
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,359
response as an indicator for the

819
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,840
presence of double strand breaks we

820
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:10,839
could say if we look at other stresses

821
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:13,240
do we see the induction of this response

822
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:15,720
at all so again here's with gamma this

823
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,720
is another kind of ionizing R radiation

824
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,558
hce this is in the ATM mutant and this

825
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,639
is a particularly nice diagnostic

826
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:27,879
cluster of transcripts that are ATM

827
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:30,839
dependent induced so if we mask all this

828
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:34,278
and look at some other

829
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:36,918
stresses salt osmotic drought cold heat

830
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:39,398
blah blah blah blah blah we are not

831
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,038
seeing these clusters of genes so again

832
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:44,319
we've clustered expression based just on

833
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:46,879
gamma and then we've extended that

834
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:49,200
analysis to look at other stresses and

835
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,159
we see a nice block here this is

836
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,840
genotoxic stress it's a combination of

837
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,679
MMS and momy C so again it's just a DNA

838
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,278
repair experiment

839
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,278
hydroxy Ura is an inhibitor of DNA

840
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:04,599
replication and we can see a little

841
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:07,038
there but if we look at these more

842
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:07,038
generic

843
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:12,320
stresses you know if you squint you can

844
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:15,039
see it in salt and that's the roots as

845
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,960
opposed to the shoots and this is UVB

846
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,279
you can see it a little there but that's

847
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,280
about

848
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,960
it all right so if we look at the Go

849
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,679
category and we've already discussed

850
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,240
this a little of these ATM dependent

851
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:30,159
gamma induced genes it's it's massive ly

852
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:34,199
over represented for RNA and DNA

853
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,119
metabolism and if we again look through

854
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,598
all these stresses and just take the RNA

855
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,519
and DNA metabolism genes that we really

856
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,919
understand and look really hard for

857
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:45,559
their induction by generic stress we

858
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:48,480
don't see it right so this response is

859
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:52,199
not there to deal with generic

860
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,480
stresses it may be there to deal with um

861
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,878
seed

862
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,960
storage Okay

863
00:34:55,878 --> 00:35:02,078
so this is just what I told you

864
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,599
here um surprisingly it's not even

865
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,560
induced by paraquat which is

866
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,559
specifically a Ross

867
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:11,838
inducer so what's different between

868
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:13,920
paraquat and ionizing radiation again

869
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:17,838
ionizing radiation is producing clusters

870
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,599
of Ros the the amount of energy

871
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,679
deposited in a very small area is very

872
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:24,960
high and you damage both strands normal

873
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:27,559
Ross just doesn't do that damages single

874
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,960
bases happens all the times that plants

875
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:32,239
and they're very very good at coping

876
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,480
using excision repair to repair singly

877
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,199
damaged

878
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,000
bases okay so desiccation tolerance and

879
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:42,358
radiation tolerance seem to be two sides

880
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,599
of the same coin so this is a famous

881
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:48,239
organism that's extremely radiation

882
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,559
resistant and it was found that it's

883
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,479
also extremely desiccation resistant

884
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:55,000
mutants that are sensitive to IR are

885
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,960
also sensitive to dehydration if you do

886
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,039
the transcriptomics the two stresses

887
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,119
induce the same thing and um dehydration

888
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:03,440
indeed induces massive amounts of breaks

889
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:06,480
it's not just dehydration it's

890
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:10,200
dehydration rehydration

891
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,199
cycling and um Chris West and wander

892
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:13,879
waterworth have done some research on

893
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:15,919
this and they have shown that as the

894
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,200
plant as the rabbit Ops the seed is

895
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,159
germinating there's a one or two hour

896
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:23,159
window during inhibition at which you

897
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:25,039
see the induction of this response and

898
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:27,239
then it goes away again but you have to

899
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:30,079
really take thin slices of time to see

900
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:32,358
that so and they've also shown DNA lagas

901
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,000
4 is important for seed longevity so

902
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:36,559
that probably is what this really

903
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,280
elaborate response is all about okay so

904
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,679
to summarize so far and I'm not going to

905
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,680
get all the way through this talk for

906
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,399
sure um the we're looking at the

907
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:48,919
immediate actual response to double

908
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,599
strand breaks and rabid opsis has a

909
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,760
robust very reproducible transcriptional

910
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,800
response to IR which is governed by ATM

911
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,680
and so one and transcriptional response

912
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,400
to IR is important in mammals and Fung

913
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:05,799
p-53 is a transcription Factor but it is

914
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,358
nowhere near this amplitude or this

915
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,880
reproducibility all right the

916
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:12,239
transcription scrms induced early after

917
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,960
IR a dsb

918
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:17,639
specific and um you can

919
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,079
see uh that a rabid opsis induces a

920
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:23,358
program cell death response that is also

921
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,640
ATM and San dependent to both UV which I

922
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,480
didn't discuss and ionizing radiation

923
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:29,318
and this is focused largely in the

924
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,199
precursor cells of the

925
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:32,838
steel all right so we know that

926
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,799
different cells respond in different

927
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:37,920
ways to gamma

928
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,119
radiation and so we can ask is the

929
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,639
short-term transcriptional response

930
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:44,680
different in different cells so this

931
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,679
requires the presence of SOG one SOG

932
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:49,078
one's a transcription Factor we can

933
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:50,799
cross our fingers and hope that these

934
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,920
cells have a different transcriptional

935
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,599
response then these cells around them

936
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,599
and if we could do the transcriptomics

937
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:01,400
of just these cells um it might give us

938
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,519
a clue as to some of the connecting dots

939
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,358
between the double strand brakes and the

940
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:08,000
induction of cell

941
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:10,480
death all right so just as an example of

942
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,760
the cell type specificity of DNA damage

943
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:18,358
response Phil made this construct of a

944
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,880
Brea one promoter fused to LFR and what

945
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:23,000
he's going to do is going to take the

946
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:26,000
same plate here he's going to collect 20

947
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,440
minute batches of photons for 9 hours

948
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,559
after radio

949
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,119
ation so again this is exact same plate

950
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,480
and here are these plants growing you

951
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:37,240
can see the true leaves the codal

952
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,639
leadens are dimmer this is at one hour

953
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:40,959
and here's the root tip and when you

954
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:42,759
watch this and we'll cycle through it

955
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,720
several times you might check out the

956
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,359
root tip first and then you can look

957
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:49,199
farther up to see what's going on next

958
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:52,598
time around so here it

959
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,919
goes we're at 3 hours and this flare has

960
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,079
come up and now it's starting to

961
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,358
disappear here's something particularly

962
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,880
beautiful you see these evenly spaced

963
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:03,799
spots of Brea one induction so we're

964
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,838
coming around again if we look higher up

965
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,079
we can see the root tips of the lateral

966
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,318
Roots lighting up lighter than the root

967
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,280
tip down

968
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:16,639
here and one more

969
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:19,480
time we can also see at this time Point

970
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:21,759
evenly spaced white spots within the

971
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,880
roof which are probably the areas where

972
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,040
the lateral roots are going to come out

973
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,880
and emerge later that's not clear to me

974
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,559
that those cells are dividing already

975
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,280
but they know that they're miror stem

976
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,239
already okay so in the case of Brea 1 we

977
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,839
we can clearly see that timing is

978
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:39,879
different for different cell types and

979
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:41,838
some cells never express braa one and um

980
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,039
some cells express it more strongly

981
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,799
there's lots in the highly mitotic new

982
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:47,358
leaves there's less than the already

983
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,720
developed

984
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,400
calans so in the case of Brea one we'll

985
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:52,118
probably see induction only in cells

986
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,400
that

987
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:56,920
undergo or can undergo or are undergoing

988
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,559
DNA replication

989
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,159
because braa one is involved in

990
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,400
homologous repair of double strand

991
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:06,118
brakes and that occurs during S phase in

992
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,800
G2 because it uses the sister chromatid

993
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:11,640
as a template to repair the DNA so the

994
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,920
process at least in mammals is is very

995
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:16,559
cell cycle regulated and it's absolutely

996
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,559
suppressed in

997
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:22,559
G1 so Phil went on to ask this the

998
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:24,159
quality of the transcriptional response

999
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,719
vary with cell type so this was all

1000
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:28,559
about quantity and timing for one cell

1001
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:31,399
so we're going to go ahead and do the

1002
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:34,000
transcriptomics for a particular cell

1003
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,800
type and cells type specific

1004
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,599
transcriptomics can tell us lots of

1005
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,160
things they help us identify First

1006
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:42,760
transcripts that we would never have

1007
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,039
seen on a whole groundup seedling

1008
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,960
because they're only being induced say

1009
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:48,000
in four cells that you're interested in

1010
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,280
you're going to have to do a lot of work

1011
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,119
to isolate those four cells and look at

1012
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,560
them and then but the suddenly that

1013
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:56,440
signal will stand out you wouldn't have

1014
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:57,880
seen it before now cell Phil's not

1015
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,480
looking at just four cells he's looking

1016
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,079
at a whole batch of cells that turned

1017
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,519
out to be about 5% of the total cells of

1018
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,240
the root tips that he's looking at you

1019
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:08,679
can identify candidate genes for

1020
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,838
Regulators of the effectors of cell type

1021
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:12,759
specific processes and that's the gold

1022
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:17,078
that we're really looking for in this

1023
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,079
kind of experiment is to identify new

1024
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:21,598
regulators and you know just looking at

1025
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,559
go analysis can provide clues as to

1026
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,800
what's going

1027
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:28,599
on okay so again we're going to attempt

1028
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,880
to at these cells we can't do this

1029
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:35,000
perfectly but what we're going to use is

1030
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:38,400
a p wooden leg gfp Fusion that labels

1031
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,920
these really the dividing steel cells

1032
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,720
the ones that are still undergoing

1033
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,559
replication so the timing we didn't have

1034
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,799
a lot of money so we didn't do a lot of

1035
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,599
time points just one Phil chose

1036
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,039
something between four hours at which he

1037
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:55,079
could see no cell death in 6 hours at

1038
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:58,480
which he could after

1039
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:00,960
radiation and and his protocol is this

1040
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,639
so we're taking the gfp positive line

1041
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,119
we're cutting off just the root tips and

1042
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:07,559
throwing away the top of the plant then

1043
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,480
we're going to protoplast the root tips

1044
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:13,039
we're going to sell sort away the gfp

1045
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,079
plus and collect this population it's

1046
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:18,279
about 5% of this population now Phil did

1047
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,400
not sort away what we're drawing here is

1048
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:24,319
red versus green he just took the entire

1049
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,639
thing so we're comparing GP plus to the

1050
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:29,039
entire all right and just to that the

1051
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:31,118
sort worked short root is a transcript

1052
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,759
that should only be expressed in this

1053
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,200
population and you can see that it's

1054
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,000
enhanced for expression of short root

1055
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,799
whereas um actin is expressed throughout

1056
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,920
and you can see that if you take the

1057
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,839
entire root tip versus a gfp pu positive

1058
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,599
these are pretty much the same but short

1059
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:49,759
root is ened here so the sort

1060
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,318
worked and just to go through this

1061
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,680
really quickly this is he's doing his

1062
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:56,960
RNA seek analysis most of this is

1063
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:59,679
gibberish to me but I trust my people in

1064
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,720
my lab if we do the go analysis of these

1065
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,239
genes that are induced in both tissues

1066
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:06,078
equally what we see is this gamma

1067
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,318
response that we discussed before the

1068
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,920
res we the response to double strand

1069
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,000
breaks so this is happening in the outer

1070
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,760
shell and in the inner core of the root

1071
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,280
tip both of them are responding to

1072
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,599
double strand

1073
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,599
braks this is just telling you the same

1074
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:23,880
thing repressed in both tissues is the

1075
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,720
cell cycle so all these things about

1076
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,800
building new cells it's being shut down

1077
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:28,399
tempor

1078
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,359
while the root tip is responding to the

1079
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,160
under gr of

1080
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:35,558
radiation if we look at genes that are

1081
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:37,078
induced more strongly in the gfp plus

1082
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:39,400
which is really what we're looking for

1083
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,160
that's why we're doing the experiment

1084
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,079
and you look at these go categories and

1085
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:44,920
again these go categories are are

1086
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,640
somewhat redundant and the same genes

1087
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,880
may be falling into multiple go

1088
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:51,719
categories these all have to do with

1089
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,280
immune response so as plant biologists

1090
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:55,759
I'm sure you're sensitive with a hypers

1091
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,920
sensitive response to pathogens and this

1092
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,119
is suggesting that there are

1093
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,680
commonalities between the two probably

1094
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:03,800
the detection is

1095
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,558
different but it may be that the cell

1096
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,440
death itself is similar and the

1097
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,960
connection somewhere those two processes

1098
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,559
meet up into the same signal

1099
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,960
transduction chain perhaps so we're

1100
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:17,440
seeing a similar effect again induced

1101
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,880
specifically in the population that's

1102
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,559
going to

1103
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,720
die and this is just showing you the

1104
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:27,880
relative fold induction in gfp Plus

1105
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:30,959
versus the entire root tip

1106
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,800
here and um Phil took a couple of these

1107
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,358
genes made gfp

1108
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,920
fusions transform them into plants and

1109
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:40,400
he can get some very pretty pictures

1110
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,920
without ionizing radiation this is a

1111
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,440
sence Associated Gene 14 this is with if

1112
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,358
you look carefully and you know your

1113
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,880
root tip morphology you see that this is

1114
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:53,358
not part of the steel right so even

1115
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,640
though we're purifying cells in the

1116
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:58,318
steel this is also induced outside of

1117
00:44:55,639 --> 00:45:00,239
the steel steel but it is induced right

1118
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,318
here in the root tip and it's very ir

1119
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,799
inducible and there's lots of expression

1120
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:05,800
within the steel going up

1121
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,039
too all right so that we told you that

1122
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,440
the cell type specific transcriptomics

1123
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,838
can identify transcripts from selected

1124
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,240
cell types whose signals are normally

1125
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:21,119
swamped and that's another interesting

1126
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:22,318
result that Phil got there is a gene

1127
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,000
called ear

1128
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,558
F-15 which is very hard to detect

1129
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,760
because it's very very very poorly

1130
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:32,359
expressed and he sees it as being

1131
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:35,839
induced in his gfp plus population by

1132
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:37,799
ir and what is the function of this Gene

1133
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:38,838
Le develder lab had this paper in

1134
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,680
science

1135
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:46,159
2013 erf 115 if it's

1136
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:49,039
overexpressed causes the cells in the um

1137
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:52,159
QC you know the sort of organizing core

1138
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:55,079
of the root tip to divide so it

1139
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:58,598
stimulates division of the QC so it's

1140
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:01,480
interesting that at a time at which cell

1141
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:04,960
division is being actively repressed in

1142
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:08,400
the root 10 this stimulating Gene that's

1143
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,920
specific for the QC is being induced and

1144
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,318
Phil and I are still arguing about this

1145
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,599
but I believe we're also seeing

1146
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:20,599
induction of loxs 5 which is another QC

1147
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:23,318
specific transcript right that

1148
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:25,160
suppresses division of cells in the QC

1149
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:28,318
so I think what we're seeing is

1150
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:31,480
induction of QC identity in tissues

1151
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,480
where it shouldn't be

1152
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:37,480
present okay so the other thing we

1153
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,240
promised you was that we could identify

1154
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,240
candidate genes for Regulators or

1155
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:44,318
affectors of cell cycle specific Pro um

1156
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:47,479
processes and this is where our story

1157
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:49,558
gets a little bit sad because we're just

1158
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,119
starting to look at this but I don't

1159
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:54,960
know so Phil took 15 different

1160
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,880
homozygous exonic insertion lines

1161
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,079
representing 10 of these iron induced

1162
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,640
transcripts and none of them were mutant

1163
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:04,480
for PCD program cell death and he took

1164
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,920
seven exonic insertion lines

1165
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,920
representing seven repressed transcript

1166
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,480
and none of them were mutant for

1167
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,119
PCD and then he just got a little

1168
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,480
desperate and he took 11 genes that

1169
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:19,440
govern already known to govern hypers

1170
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:23,880
sensitive response and none of them were

1171
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,519
mutant for PCD either so you know we

1172
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,480
need to look more carefully at this but

1173
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:29,719
no one's particularly motivated to

1174
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,358
because this is this rather depressing

1175
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:34,000
result in the beginning so the

1176
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:35,639
conclusions for part two and I don't

1177
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,760
think I can go on to part three but I do

1178
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:40,838
want to show you just one picture Roots

1179
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,559
can recover from massive doses of ir um

1180
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:44,639
oh this is the early results so I

1181
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,960
haven't I haven't discussed this yet the

1182
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,440
transcriptional response is required H

1183
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,639
this is all later so I'm going to go

1184
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:54,880
into this um talking about day one a

1185
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:57,239
little bit so this is things that happen

1186
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,880
after day one so the root tip undergo

1187
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:01,358
cell death in this programmed way at

1188
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,039
later time points it spreads up the root

1189
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:06,199
is going to have to recover because it

1190
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:08,719
will at this dose recover and go on with

1191
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:10,480
growth um as plant biologists you're

1192
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,639
familiar with the QC which is a

1193
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,760
population of about four cells that

1194
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:18,039
basically provide identity to this but

1195
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,839
as a DNA repair and Recovery person I

1196
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:21,679
have always thought of the QC as a

1197
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:24,639
population of cells that is

1198
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:26,838
intentionally never dividing so that it

1199
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,558
never has problems with DNA damage it's

1200
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:30,759
not undergoing replication making

1201
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,440
replication errors it's not cycling so

1202
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,720
it's not so sensitive to double Stone

1203
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,880
breaks and it's there to replace these

1204
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:39,919
cells which are foolish enough to be

1205
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,920
dividing right so so that's a great

1206
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,559
reason to have a quiescent center but

1207
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,720
what I'm seeing when I look at the

1208
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,519
expression of qci identity after

1209
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:51,159
radiation makes me think that perhaps

1210
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:53,400
this is incorrect so just to move on

1211
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:53,399
with

1212
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:58,960
this okay

1213
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:02,399
if we look at a wild type plant we give

1214
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,400
it 150 gr of radiation we watch the root

1215
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,838
growth over the days there's still

1216
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,798
growth During the period after radiation

1217
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:11,159
because most of the growth is elongation

1218
00:49:08,798 --> 00:49:14,159
you don't need to supply new cells you

1219
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:16,759
run out of new cells by then the

1220
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,480
meristem starts growing again and you

1221
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,720
get root growth again if you look at a

1222
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,798
SOG

1223
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:24,719
mutant at this dose the sog mutant

1224
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:26,759
actually stops growing and doesn't

1225
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,078
recover so Saga is doing something

1226
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:32,240
that's important for Recovery of the

1227
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:34,519
root tip 24 hours after 150 gray you can

1228
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:36,078
see that um wild type has experienced a

1229
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:37,960
fair amount of cell death at this

1230
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,240
particular dose this particular

1231
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:44,039
experiment we can still see the QC in

1232
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:46,239
these root tips not getting cell death

1233
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:48,000
and this is the complemented line just a

1234
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,558
control to show you that's really a San

1235
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,679
dependent effect if we look 3 days after

1236
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,720
150 gray we're starting to get

1237
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:56,919
elongation of these cells as the

1238
00:49:54,719 --> 00:50:00,598
differentiations Z proceeds down towards

1239
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,480
the root tip we can no longer see the QC

1240
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:04,720
in Wild type so this structure is

1241
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,880
getting messed up still looks nice and

1242
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:09,399
organized in SOG and if you put them on

1243
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:12,599
constitutive rather than acute DNA

1244
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,480
damaging agent SOG looks lovely compared

1245
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:16,798
with wild type so it maintains its root

1246
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,358
shape and again this complimented line

1247
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:23,039
QC is gone we can't see

1248
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:26,838
it if we look 5 days after we can still

1249
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:30,759
see the QC and SOG we only see a mess in

1250
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:33,558
these root tips and then 7 days after

1251
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:35,319
the situation changes the root tip has

1252
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:37,240
recovered in Wild type it's

1253
00:50:35,318 --> 00:50:39,880
reestablished and has grown away from

1254
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:43,279
all that big fat cell crap the root tip

1255
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,079
is now growing again same thing here and

1256
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,880
differentiation has proceeded all the

1257
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:48,480
way down to the tip and SOG and it's not

1258
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,559
going to be a marem

1259
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,079
anymore all right so if you look at the

1260
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,400
growth day after

1261
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,240
day both of these things keep growing

1262
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,240
and then they slow down when they

1263
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,159
finally stop growing they produce a lot

1264
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,798
of root hairs at this point it leaves

1265
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:05,039
what we call a scar so you can tell

1266
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:08,239
where they stopped and then as the days

1267
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:10,400
go on a new maristone will be formed in

1268
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,318
Wild type it has to reorganize itself

1269
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,160
and then it'll grow away from all of

1270
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:17,838
this mess giving you this growth curve

1271
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:20,318
here interestingly if you look at

1272
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:21,759
expression of walks five which is a QC

1273
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:25,759
specific

1274
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:29,400
Gene transcript what you see is that um

1275
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:31,079
as the days proceed after radiation in

1276
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,400
Wild type and we haven't looked at SOG

1277
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:36,119
yet because we don't have the line yet

1278
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:40,039
walk 5 expression spreads throughout the

1279
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:42,798
root tip so it's as if all of these

1280
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:46,199
cells are volunteering for the position

1281
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:48,639
of new QC and when this root tip finally

1282
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:51,358
reemerges you're back to having walks 5

1283
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:54,039
expression only in those four cells so

1284
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:56,719
somehow the QC is selecting among all

1285
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:59,759
these potentially cra happy cells to

1286
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:02,279
find perhaps a really good one that is

1287
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,720
going to make up the new QC which is a

1288
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,960
bit of a stretch but that's what they

1289
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:09,239
seem to be doing okay so I

1290
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,920
should just move on to thank the people

1291
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:12,639
responsible for this so you may have met

1292
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,920
Phil Conlin he's moved here in Mike

1293
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:18,118
scandin lab just recently and he and

1294
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,639
Victor were responsible for a lot of the

1295
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:23,400
transcriptomics analysis but filled it

1296
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:25,519
all the wet lab type

1297
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,838
experiments and this is just to thank

1298
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:29,119
the rest of my lab who's doing other

1299
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:31,078
projects and other things that you can

1300
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,960
ask me about too and of course I'd like

1301
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:37,000
to thank the students again for inviting

1302
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,000
me here it's been a pleasure so

1303
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,679
far this has been a production of

1304
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,680
Cornell University on the web at

1305
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:47,679
