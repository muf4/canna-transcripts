1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,839
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,839
university

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,120
that are commercially available and

4
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,600
a small colony that needs to be

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,679
redeployed every

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,118
six to eight weeks or so

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,039
or you could also use mechanical

8
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,559
ventilation

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,720
in in the small scale of research that

10
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,439
we have at cornell it wasn't practical

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,118
for us to obtain bumble bees so we

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,238
actually used a

13
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:36,320
um a leaf blower um this was a battery

14
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,159
operated leaf blower that was not very

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,320
powerful and we kind of throttled it

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,679
down and so once a day we would move

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,558
through the

18
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,439
crop

19
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,679
and

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,920
tried to carefully

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,600
blow the flower clusters to mechanically

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,160
pollinate them

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,079
it was decently effective but we would

24
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,519
we would periodically see misshapen

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
fruit indicating that there was poor

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,879
pollination of our flowers

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,799
so these rows are typically spaced about

28
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,198
three feet apart

29
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,879
sometimes slightly tighter spacing 2.6

30
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,118
to 3.3

31
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,319
feet apart

32
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,719
and then

33
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,719
that would give us a plant density

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,319
of so if this slab is about three feet

35
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,079
long or a meter long and they're spaced

36
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,158
a meter apart we'd have anywhere from

37
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,640
eight to twelve plants per square meter

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:27,439
or about uh one plant just under just

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:30,000
over per um square foot per plant

40
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,959
so some of the the benefits of growing

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
in

42
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,798
greenhouses or high tunnels would be

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,560
season extension or year-round

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,799
production

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,759
we can have reduced disease and we

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,840
certainly see this in cases where in a

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,759
in a high tunnel for example we're

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,439
protecting our plant from

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,759
from rain water

50
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,559
that that can damage the the fruit it

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,000
can lead to leaf-borne pathogens

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
similarly in a greenhouse we would have

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,560
that that benefit we can also control

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,759
the the relative humidity and the air

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
flow

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,200
to reduce

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
those foliar diseases

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,598
um we can also grow where there's poor

59
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,719
soil drainage in in the underlying field

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,399
and then

61
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,878
there are some really nice gains in

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,319
labor ergonomics so we're not bending

63
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,878
down to work in the

64
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,719
crop that's planted into the ground but

65
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:21,679
the crop is at waist height or slightly

66
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,800
higher

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,599
and so it's easier to to transplant

68
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,280
and

69
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,560
pick fruit for example and maintain the

70
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,640
crop

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,239
and overall because we're in an

72
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,559
environment where we either have some

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,800
control or even more control with with

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,560
the temperature and adding supplemental

75
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,599
light in some cases

76
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,439
we get higher yield and quality

77
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,679
than outdoors

78
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,239
some of the some of the cons that we

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,519
have to think about is

80
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,239
it is a

81
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,759
soilless substrate production requires

82
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,080
more precise irrigation and

83
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,639
fertilization practices so this would

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,159
typically include weekly monitoring

85
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,039
of the root zone

86
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,560
ph and and fertility level or electrical

87
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,039
conductivity

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,640
periodically sending samples to

89
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,840
like leaf tissue samples to a lab for

90
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,479
analysis to make sure that our

91
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,800
fertilizer program is on track

92
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,959
and then periodically monitoring and

93
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,800
adjusting the the amount of irrigation

94
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,800
water that we're supplying

95
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,680
at each irrigation event

96
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,680
so it also requires more more time and

97
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,840
more money for controlling the

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,239
environment

99
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,560
we still see a proliferation of insects

100
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,319
often so mites thrips

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,598
and aphids

102
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,679
and so

103
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,000
then you also have to establish an

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,080
integrated pest management program

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,239
and a lot of times in a greenhouse that

106
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,159
would focus on using

107
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,200
beneficial insects so good bugs that

108
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,878
fight bad bugs um as well as there are

109
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,079
some examples of

110
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,639
typically there's their softer

111
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,599
pesticides that are registered for

112
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,119
um an edible crop in the greenhouse

113
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,039
and we definitely have higher production

114
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,920
costs than in a field

115
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,759
we do have higher output as well

116
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,318
i remember there was a study from from

117
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,399
the university of arizona that even in a

118
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,238
in an arizona greenhouse which requires

119
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,840
a lot less heat and supplemental light

120
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,759
than a new york greenhouse they were

121
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,280
looking at input costs of about four

122
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,560
dollars per pound of strawberries um and

123
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,039
so you have to think about how you would

124
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,079
differentiate differentiate your product

125
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,479
um to bring a higher uh price at market

126
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,959
and some of that could be the off-season

127
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,039
production but you would need to produce

128
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,319
a high quality flavorful product that's

129
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,280
going to

130
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,279
bring consumers out

131
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,439
just a little bit about cultivars

132
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,400
typically in high tunnels we're looking

133
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,600
at using day neutral cultivars um a

134
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,399
little bit later i'll show you some

135
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,160
specific examples of that um and so we

136
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,679
use these ever-bearing cultivars so that

137
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,520
we can take advantage of an extended

138
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,319
growing season and we would harvest them

139
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,959
over multiple months in the high tunnel

140
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,719
in a greenhouse or vertical farm

141
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,638
we can use either day neutral or short

142
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,800
day cultivars so day neutral could give

143
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
us several months of

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
harvesting

145
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,840
for short day plants

146
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,919
these could be more productive because

147
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,719
they'll give us you know a large flush

148
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:17,198
of fruit and so these would be plants

149
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,840
that that were growing up ahead of time

150
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,840
kept in coolers until we want to force

151
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,279
them or establish them in the greenhouse

152
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,679
for fruiting

153
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,918
and then we would we would have

154
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
several crop cycles per year so this

155
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:33,198
would take quite a bit of labor

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,079
to to bring our plants out of the cooler

157
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,080
force them to to fruit and let them

158
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,918
fruit for for a few months and then take

159
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,599
them out again

160
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,918
um and so

161
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,080
um in a in a greenhouse often our

162
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,560
limiting factor for when we can can grow

163
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,319
these plants is it's really hard to

164
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,399
maintain cool enough conditions in the

165
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,879
summer time depending on on your climate

166
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,719
new york has has different climates

167
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,879
but if we have high night temperatures

168
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,080
so night temperatures above about

169
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,639
um

170
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,800
if they're higher than the low 60s

171
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,918
we get poorer berry production and we

172
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,560
get poorer fruit quality so the fruit

173
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,560
are not as

174
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,120
sweet

175
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,478
and with our cultivar selection we have

176
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,478
to consider again that market

177
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,599
differentiation so choosing cultivars

178
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,159
that have

179
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,199
good flavor and quality

180
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,560
just a little bit about the

181
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,520
environmental conditions so we're

182
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,240
looking at

183
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,599
day temperatures of 68 to 75 degrees

184
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,079
fahrenheit

185
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,720
ideal night temperatures are quite cool

186
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,560
50 to 54 degrees fahrenheit on those

187
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,080
lower temperatures give us larger fruit

188
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,478
size and better

189
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,439
flavor and sweetness of berries

190
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,918
and then above 60 to 65

191
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,719
leads to higher acidity levels so we get

192
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,038
a

193
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,120
more acidic fruit

194
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,079
the optimum light that we would get is

195
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,000
is

196
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,758
fairly moderate kind of sunlight

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,720
conditions

198
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,038
and if you if we talk about light

199
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,759
in moles per meter squared per day

200
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,439
um we'd be in between a lettuce plant

201
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,879
and a tomato plant for example so

202
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,879
lettuce would have about 15 moles of

203
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,800
light per day tomatoes we'd have about

204
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,000
30 moles of light per day

205
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,478
and so

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,439
we would want 20 to 25 which means in

207
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,719
the winter time if we want a good output

208
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,038
from our crop we would definitely have

209
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,520
to use supplemental lighting

210
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,959
similarly many greenhouse growers in the

211
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,680
winter time

212
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,758
would enrich with carbon dioxide to make

213
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,160
to improve crop productivity so co2

214
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,560
feeds into photosynthesis and that

215
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,039
include improves our crop yield by

216
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,839
maybe 20 to 30 percent

217
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:42,159
um and then humidity is uh 40 to 60

218
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,038
during the day and then during the night

219
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,400
we actually want to have high humidity

220
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:51,120
and i'll explain that for a minute so

221
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:53,038
three hours at 95 humidity at night

222
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,639
so a typical greenhouse production

223
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,719
schedule would have us

224
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,199
say transplanting

225
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,479
will develop tray plants

226
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,680
so plants that were previously

227
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:02,639
propagated

228
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,439
um

229
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,199
about two to two and a half months

230
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,120
before um

231
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,199
they're transplanted flowering begins in

232
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,280
september through october and then we're

233
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,400
harvesting our plants uh november

234
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,000
through may

235
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,279
with the harvest ending wind when

236
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,879
temperatures get too warm in the

237
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,239
greenhouse

238
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,879
and one of the bottlenecks that i'm

239
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,400
hearing about from from greenhouse

240
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,280
strawberry growers is it's hard to

241
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,598
source

242
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,679
good tray plants from

243
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,439
propagators so many growers will do

244
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,200
their own propagation in the summer time

245
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,440
where they'll take runner tips and root

246
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:41,000
them and then grow them on in 125 to 250

247
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,000
milliliter pots

248
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,559
just a few photos

249
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,159
from

250
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,479
greenhouse strawberry production these

251
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,838
are these are plants that are getting

252
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,039
established in this case the the plastic

253
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,120
is used to help prevent

254
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,120
weeds that could that could proliferate

255
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,039
in the soil substrate

256
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,039
as well it could help with some insects

257
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,159
so like thrips for example or fungus

258
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,120
nets so so thrips are on the leaves but

259
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,199
then

260
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,759
they actually pupate in the soil and so

261
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,440
they drop down

262
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,399
and pupate in the soil so that can help

263
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,519
restrict them

264
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,759
here's a view of this greenhouse did not

265
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,839
have supplemental lighting

266
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,679
but they did have photoperiodic lighting

267
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,560
so to to trick the plant into thinking

268
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,559
that it's getting long days which helps

269
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,679
with with initiating more flowers and

270
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:36,000
more fruit they actually had these

271
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,000
these led lights that have some some far

272
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,759
red light

273
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,519
and those would be operated

274
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,559
four hours per day

275
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,399
during the middle of the night

276
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,119
and here's plants that are coming into

277
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,839
to fruiting and being actively harvested

278
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,839
at this point

279
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,160
um and in japan their market's quite

280
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,879
interesting these berries were selling

281
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,519
for about a dollar per berry and every

282
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,039
berry was high quality

283
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,519
and kind of packed

284
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,599
individually

285
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,480
a little bit about yields

286
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,959
for

287
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,000
for field production

288
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:16,078
in california we get about 60 000 pounds

289
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,679
per acre per year of course they have

290
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,919
this would be day neutral strawberry

291
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,000
production over several months

292
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,599
per year so that gives us about 1.4

293
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,039
pounds of fruit

294
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,680
per year

295
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:30,000
our new york field production

296
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,879
is seasonal and then much lower yields

297
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,240
so 5 000 to twenty thousand pounds per

298
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,000
acre per year

299
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,240
um so there are reports that high tunnel

300
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,759
tabletop yields can be double outdoors i

301
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,720
would say that would be like double new

302
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,240
york

303
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,200
uh style yields um and in the greenhouse

304
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,480
uh

305
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,600
we can get

306
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,240
uh

307
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,480
maybe two to two point six pounds uh

308
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,839
fruit per square foot per year

309
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,839
um a high-tech greenhouse in the

310
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,720
netherlands that would be operating

311
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,040
year-round could get up to 4.5 pounds of

312
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,800
fruit per square foot per year

313
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,159
so they had quite high yields maybe

314
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,479
about three times

315
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:09,360
the california

316
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,639
yields and nine nine times more than new

317
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,639
york field yields

318
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,278
um just a

319
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,200
bit about a couple of common disorders

320
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,759
so i mentioned that we need to maintain

321
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,600
high humidity for a few hours at night

322
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,679
um this is to avoid

323
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,839
strawberry tip burn strawberry tip burn

324
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,958
is a calcium deficiency

325
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,440
that's kind of akin to lettuce tip burn

326
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:37,278
and this is where the developing

327
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,959
tissues the leaves and the and the brax

328
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,200
a few weeks before the symptoms show up

329
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,679
like this picture on the right um there

330
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,360
was there was poor calcium supply to the

331
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,519
developing tissues

332
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,440
and calcium supply in strawberries um

333
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,240
relies a lot on having positive root

334
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,680
pressure at night so

335
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,519
if you've ever seen gutation on

336
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,120
strawberries maybe in your like outdoor

337
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,720
strawberries

338
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,759
um in the morning where there's there's

339
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,839
actually

340
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,720
water leaking through the the vessels on

341
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,480
the out of the out or edges of the leaf

342
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,480
uh that's showing us that there was

343
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,320
positive root pressure at night

344
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,920
so instead of water being pulled through

345
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,639
through transpiration

346
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,879
um a positive root pressure built up and

347
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,879
and water was pushed through the plant

348
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,639
to deliver calcium

349
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,639
and so so for strawberries that's that's

350
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,039
a good sign we need that that to help

351
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,839
deliver calcium to the plant to avoid

352
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:32,639
um tip burn which can um

353
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,680
impair our leaf productivity it can also

354
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,278
make fruit unsightly if the if the

355
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,239
um sepals have

356
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,240
this to burn as well

357
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,559
so

358
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,799
common pests and diseases are aphids

359
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,359
spider mites and thrips here are thrips

360
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,278
feeding in the flowers which they love

361
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,120
feeding on pollen

362
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:56,078
common diseases would be

363
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,839
powdery mildew and botrytis

364
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,278
and so here's here's botrytis for

365
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,920
example

366
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,759
gray mold that's on that's on fruit one

367
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,799
of the control mechanisms that we have

368
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,958
there is to remove any decaying tissue

369
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,479
or dying tissue including any like

370
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:13,838
over-mature fruit that was not

371
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,839
previously harvested

372
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,519
um at

373
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,720
cornell one of our earlier greenhouse

374
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,919
research projects was to screen

375
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,680
a few different cultivars of

376
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,759
strawberries

377
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,479
and these were all day neutral

378
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,159
strawberries so albion cabrio seascape

379
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,839
and portola

380
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,639
were used in this study

381
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,399
and

382
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,320
we looked at

383
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,958
the bricks or the sugar content of berry

384
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,519
we also looked at at yields

385
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:45,518
and so this was over

386
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,360
a six-month period in the winter time

387
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,198
and albion

388
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,800
gave us our lowest yields we could

389
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,759
actually get almost twice the yields

390
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,519
with cultivars cabrillo and 50 higher

391
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,759
yields with portola

392
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,360
but one of the things that we found

393
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,958
and is well known with albion is it's a

394
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,199
very sweet berry

395
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,958
and so it's still one of the lb and it

396
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,559
would be probably the most common

397
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,599
greenhouse strawberry varieties that are

398
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,119
used

399
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,040
because of its sweetness

400
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,440
so we have to think about that market

401
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,519
differentiation again could we double

402
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,040
our yield but have a less sweet berry

403
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,240
and would the consumer be okay with that

404
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,958
so i'll

405
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:29,198
conclude with just a couple trends that

406
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:30,879
we're seeing for ca strawberries um so

407
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,359
two-thirds of the strawberry production

408
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,278
area in the uk is in soilless substrates

409
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,639
so it's largely moved away from from

410
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,198
field soils

411
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,919
because of the control that you get

412
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:45,120
um in the netherlands there's 815 acres

413
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,919
of strawberry production under glass

414
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,799
so so a large share of their crop

415
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,479
in

416
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,319
north america and the u.s we're just

417
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,079
starting to see increased interest in

418
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,079
greenhouse strawberry production so new

419
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,559
york we have green empire farms which is

420
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,000
32 acres of greenhouse strawberry

421
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,319
production

422
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,198
in california we have 90 acres of table

423
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,278
top production this would be outdoors

424
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,879
but in soilless substrates

425
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,439
and in canada

426
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,439
we have a couple large farms now with

427
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,440
with greenhouse strawberries and then

428
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,160
we're seeing vertical farms too

429
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
so

430
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,639
i thought this was interesting um oishii

431
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,600
is a vertical farm company based out of

432
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,959
new jersey and they shall they sell

433
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,680
strawberries

434
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,919
to high-end markets um this this box

435
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,719
with 11 strawberries actually sells for

436
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,719
fifty dollars

437
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,278
so imagine paying five dollars per

438
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,278
strawberry um

439
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,120
so people are really captivated by this

440
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,879
fruit and they'll still sell them to

441
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,198
kind of top restaurants and high-end

442
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,958
consumers that maybe want to impress

443
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,120
their loved one with with very tasty

444
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,799
strawberries so maybe that's something

445
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,240
we could aspire to

446
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,399
as well and i think we could do it for

447
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,480
much much cheaper in a greenhouse or

448
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,120
high tunnel

449
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,519
with that i will stop and i think i've

450
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,360
used up any time i had for questions but

451
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,440
i'm happy to

452
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,800
sit and monitor the chat and i'll be

453
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,399
responding during the session this

454
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:14,078
morning um so moving right along our

455
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:17,039
next presenter is kathy jem dem check

456
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:19,439
many of you know kathy she is a been a

457
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,958
long time supporter of berry um

458
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,120
production

459
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,119
research and extension efforts in the

460
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,198
northeast she's a senior extension

461
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,799
associate at the penn state university

462
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,879
where her responsibilities are to

463
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,319
conduct applied research into

464
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,720
technologies that improve the

465
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,720
sustainability of berry production with

466
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,560
the overall goal of reducing negative

467
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,519
environmental impacts of production

468
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:44,399
while maximizing crop productivity so

469
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,278
kathy if you want to share your screen

470
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,879
and

471
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,679
take it away

472
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,600
okay so um so we've been doing some work

473
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,078
um in containerized production of

474
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,360
strawberries um and

475
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,559
and um raspberries for for a few a few

476
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,639
years now

477
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,239
um we had been dabbling with it earlier

478
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,078
so i'm going to give a little history

479
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,519
and talk a little bit about where we've

480
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:09,599
ended up

481
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:11,918
um and what conclusions we have so far

482
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,678
and then um primarily concentrate on

483
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,600
some of the pests

484
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,839
so even though you know as neil

485
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,399
mentioned a lot of the work seems to be

486
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:23,759
you know increasing recently

487
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,679
um you know these are some systems um

488
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,318
different solar systems the growers have

489
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,519
been trying off and on for for over 20

490
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:34,558
years now in the northeast and sometimes

491
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:37,279
it's gone okay sometimes there have been

492
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,960
um you know they've given up and moved

493
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,038
on to other things

494
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,279
um now there's something called the ibex

495
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,279
growing system that some folks are

496
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,678
trying some

497
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:50,240
again it's a lot like some of the other

498
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,960
other systems um

499
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,640
and then of course there are gutters um

500
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,720
that people have tried over time we've

501
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,480
had some growers try like seascape and

502
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,798
mara debois

503
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,558
um so but over this time as this has

504
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,960
been happening it was a you know small

505
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:07,119
percentage of the production um but a

506
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,360
lot of the questions i was getting and

507
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:12,558
and so you know just my point in all of

508
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,399
this is that you know i'm glad we're i'm

509
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,759
working out some of these things maybe

510
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,080
because there does seem to be a

511
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,480
long-term need for info looking both

512
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,879
backwards and forwards

513
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,880
um i do want to credit you know some of

514
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,960
the work that it happened to before

515
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,280
before i you know i started working on

516
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,519
anything for sure um these be some

517
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,319
information in the n-ray strawberry

518
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,639
guide back in 1998 about greenhouse

519
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,119
production um cornell had done some work

520
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,640
on greenhouse raspberry production

521
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,558
and so some of this earlier work that

522
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,360
was done really laid the

523
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:47,839
groundwork for us to move forward um

524
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:51,599
over on the left you see a photo of a

525
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,959
young famitaker fumi had retired at the

526
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,439
end of

527
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,120
towards the end of last year

528
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,038
and then over on the right are some

529
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,639
gutters we had had back in

530
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:05,119
2003 and 2000 for um in our penn state

531
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,400
high tunnel complex which the lamont and

532
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,319
mike gorslick have been very

533
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,400
instrumental in getting going so i want

534
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,200
to thank all those folks for

535
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,679
for their help over the years

536
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,919
so more recently um

537
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,160
there has been you know the greenhouse

538
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,759
interest the controlled environment um

539
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,798
interest um with with dr davoda um mail

540
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,359
out at ohio state formerly arizona um

541
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,119
the informational presented and then as

542
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,639
he mentioned um the commercial

543
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,038
operations are

544
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,799
increasing or beginning to increase and

545
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,558
and number and size

546
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,359
neil had mentioned some of the

547
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,558
unprotected culture um

548
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,719
advantages

549
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,798
and so i don't really

550
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,640
um need to go over those so much but i

551
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,960
do want to point out you know one that

552
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,400
growers had mentioned um that is part of

553
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,558
the better quality

554
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,480
is just the more attractive appearance

555
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,960
of the fruit and as we know you know

556
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,360
consumers as folks will say bye with

557
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,960
their eyes and so having those nice

558
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,399
looking berries is important for

559
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,600
marketability

560
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,840
um that is something that um you know

561
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,558
growers have mentioned to me

562
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,038
and then regarding labor there is the

563
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,440
improved organ ergonomics if you have

564
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:21,200
the system up off of the ground but the

565
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,120
other thing is that um if you have folks

566
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,558
working for you you there is the

567
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,319
predictability

568
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,678
of when they can work and so even if

569
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,399
you're working in high tunnels it

570
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,880
doesn't matter if it's a rainy day um

571
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,600
you can still plan on harvesting on a

572
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,600
schedule or whatever you want to do

573
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,759
in that in that tunnel

574
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,038
so the way we got into this in a bigger

575
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,240
way

576
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,279
was um there was a multi-state scri

577
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,200
project

578
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,558
looking at plastic covers on high

579
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,798
tunnels

580
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,639
for high tunnels and that was led by

581
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,519
eric hanson out at michigan state

582
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,919
cornell was a part of it folks in new

583
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,119
hampshire and vermont

584
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,360
and

585
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,439
also some other states we had some

586
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,479
collaborators in the uk who were a big

587
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,400
help

588
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,319
so we had a part where we were looking

589
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,480
at the different um plastic covers on

590
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,279
the tunnels and the problem was we had a

591
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,558
lot of variation in soil between the

592
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:19,038
tunnels so bearing in ph and nutrient

593
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,399
concentration or content and so we

594
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,759
wanted to

595
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,360
get away from that and so um and we were

596
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,720
also growing both raspberries and

597
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:29,439
strawberries

598
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,038
as part of the research we were doing

599
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,279
and so we needed to

600
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,359
decided we needed to move to containers

601
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,279
but we also needed to

602
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,240
be on the

603
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,720
same irrigation setup for both crops and

604
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,519
so we had to find a system that

605
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,159
we could use um also that students who

606
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,798
were working with us could help with

607
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,000
um unfairly you know with only a little

608
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:56,319
bit of training um or that you know we

609
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,480
felt would function well over over a

610
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:01,200
weekend without running into

611
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,120
problems and so we were going for about

612
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,400
the most low tech system we could

613
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,798
possibly go for while still growing um

614
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,640
in a soilless media

615
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,599
in containers

616
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,640
and so um

617
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:22,000
okay and now for some reason my screen

618
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,120
does not want to advance so why is this

619
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,079
hmm

620
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:29,199
well that is a an interesting little

621
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:31,599
predicament to have um

622
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,200
did you try the regular advance there's

623
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,359
a there's the little ones down in the

624
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,120
left-hand corner and then sometimes if

625
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,119
you do your own

626
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,359
um on your

627
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,558
your um

628
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,519
you know your little forward arrows yes

629
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:47,918
yes

630
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:50,480
is doing it well those are not showing

631
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,640
up at the bottom unfortunately so i

632
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,400
might have to escape out of this and get

633
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,480
back to it

634
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,519
i have never had this happen

635
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,279
well

636
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:04,158
all right well let me just um see if i

637
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,079
can i'm going to just start sharing yeah

638
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,080
i'm still sharing but i'm going to just

639
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,399
try advancing here i don't know maybe

640
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,399
i'm just stuck on that one and see if we

641
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,280
can go forward from here and if not well

642
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,120
we'll try something else so anyway so we

643
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,038
had to figure the system out pretty

644
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,519
quickly um

645
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,640
and so um you know that unexpression

646
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:27,918
necessity is the mother of invention so

647
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,919
so we um basically um you know we talked

648
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,320
to a lot of folks so we talked to eric

649
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,960
out at out of michigan state

650
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:37,599
um and you know took a look at work

651
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,079
other folks had done before us um and

652
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,759
then we did a quick winter trial to try

653
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,519
out some different things where we

654
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,119
basically just

655
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,679
tried a whole bunch of stuff over a

656
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,759
winter um and we did find something that

657
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,519
would work for fairly well for us and

658
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:52,558
what this was

659
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,158
um

660
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,918
which we're not really you know

661
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,960
wholesale recommending right now but at

662
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,640
work bone our situation was a two to one

663
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,200
per light mix that we had to mix

664
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,799
ourselves it did not have lime added to

665
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,159
it because we have high bicarbonate

666
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:07,759
waters

667
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,039
and we didn't want to get into having to

668
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,038
acidify

669
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:14,400
um the water source

670
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,400
with the setup we had and fortunately um

671
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,278
this seemed to work fairly well so you

672
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,519
can see our raspberries um this is the

673
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,440
variety polka in the front um and

674
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,200
josephine in the back these were

675
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,159
actually two separate trials that were

676
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,319
happening i'm at this particular time

677
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,760
and then down in in the right

678
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,720
you see

679
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:37,200
one of our tunnels where we had albion

680
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,000
uh sweden cabrillo

681
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,400
um and san andreas growing you can see

682
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,200
right there so

683
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,880
so anyhow um so so we worked out

684
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,759
something enough for that trial to be

685
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,640
able to manage um and now we're i'm

686
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,400
continuing to look at some some things

687
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,480
um and again

688
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,798
um we're just trying to find a way of

689
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,880
growing the plants that you know almost

690
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,759
anybody could adopt who has a high

691
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,080
tunnel

692
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:08,240
um and doesn't have a real strong

693
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:10,720
background um in greenhouse production

694
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,159
so um so anyway so we tried some things

695
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,558
out last year where we knew we were

696
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,799
doing things the wrong way and long

697
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,558
story short and we figured out all sorts

698
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:19,679
of ways to make ways to make iron

699
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,119
deficient

700
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,880
and so um my approach is sometimes that

701
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,439
i need to make mistakes before i can

702
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,679
figure out how to fix them and so that's

703
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,278
that's where we were on that one

704
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,278
so anyhow so we're still working it all

705
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:36,000
out um there's a lot of potential i

706
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:38,400
think with strawberries um

707
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,480
you know there are interactions between

708
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,798
the media type you're using

709
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,120
um the water source and the fertilizer

710
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,200
you're using so we're trying to

711
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,558
you know work some of that out um our

712
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,558
conclusion we're coming to is it

713
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:52,879
probably isn't like a one-size-fits-all

714
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:55,359
approach that'll work for everybody but

715
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,278
there may be some um some ways of doing

716
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,199
this that you know say if you're in a

717
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,839
situation with a high bicarbonate water

718
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,840
then you do this or if you're not then

719
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,879
you do something different

720
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,038
but um we're still working that out

721
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,600
but um some of the overall keys i think

722
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,119
we've come up with is and which i think

723
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,719
everybody else would agree with is that

724
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,158
you do need a

725
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,960
lower ph media um so you know talking

726
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,360
down in the range of mid mid fives to

727
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,600
maybe six seems to help out

728
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,158
um if you have a high bicarbonate water

729
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,399
acidifying the water source or you start

730
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,278
out with good water quality that's good

731
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,038
um micronutrients can be an issue and

732
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,798
then we kind of found that raspberries

733
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,960
were a relative breeze compared to

734
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,158
strawberries so we're going to keep

735
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,558
working on all that um i do want to

736
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,480
just throw up this quote this is what

737
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,639
um laura had said that today's talk

738
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,240
would be about and so i'm going to spend

739
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,240
the rest of the talk

740
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,400
talking about some of the pests we've

741
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,919
seen in our trials

742
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,798
and what we've done to

743
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,960
to manage those um

744
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,759
neil had already mentioned most of these

745
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,640
so this is a great introduction

746
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,558
so um so the past issues we do see um

747
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,000
are quite a bit different than what we

748
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,639
see in the field

749
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,480
um there's you know obviously no rain or

750
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,799
overhead irrigation when you're in a

751
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,558
tunnel or a greenhouse um so that means

752
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,200
we don't have some of the rain splash

753
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:24,000
diseases like anthracnose we have

754
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,319
actually seen very little grey mold that

755
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,440
may be because in in our trials we've

756
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:31,759
kept things you know very cleanly picked

757
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,919
um and so we haven't really seen those

758
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,079
issues so much some on raspberries but

759
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,360
but not on the strawberries

760
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,960
so much

761
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,038
and then we see more of the problems and

762
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,840
these are ones that rainfall helps to

763
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,599
control um and so the ones that rainfall

764
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,558
does help to control become worse in a

765
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,599
tunnel

766
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:52,240
um or you know in a greenhouse as well

767
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,158
so powdery mildew a lot of the smaller

768
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,359
insect pests which we think of as

769
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,440
greenhouse pests so the aphids um

770
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:03,199
you know mites thrips

771
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,880
um all those sorts of things

772
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,679
so i do just want to mention too that

773
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,840
when you do get into pest issues um

774
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,200
you know the the materials that you

775
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:15,038
might use

776
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,360
um you need to be um aware of

777
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,839
the fact that the pesticides will need

778
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,519
to be labeled for um

779
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,359
for either greenhouse

780
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,359
production or it may say protected

781
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,038
culture systems or protected culture

782
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,639
production or

783
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,558
sometimes high tunnels are mentioned on

784
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,880
the label as well

785
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,879
um the way it works in pennsylvania and

786
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,559
i'm not sure about other states but it's

787
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,320
defined that if the structure is big

788
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:39,200
enough that you actually get in it to

789
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,038
work

790
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,200
then it counts as some sort of protected

791
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:47,759
culture and so the labeling has to be

792
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,360
has to have wording on it that it allows

793
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,240
it to be used

794
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,839
in that situation

795
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,000
so we're going to talk about some of the

796
00:28:53,839 --> 00:29:00,240
diseases we see first so powdery mildew

797
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,278
was was one you know we'd already

798
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,120
mentioned um and so that one when you

799
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,839
know when you don't have rain

800
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:10,239
um you know you'll tend to see more more

801
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,678
issues with it or at least more symptoms

802
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,519
on the fruit

803
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,640
because the spores

804
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,679
can be washed off by by the rain

805
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,440
and

806
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,440
also just the environment with warm

807
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,440
temperatures and higher humidity are

808
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,399
conditions of powdery mildew really like

809
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,038
so

810
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:29,839
tends to become a bigger problem

811
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:33,038
and then um we do find too that our day

812
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,759
neutral varieties are susceptible

813
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,960
to

814
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,839
um

815
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,600
to powdery mildew and um as they're

816
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,839
coming out of you know mostly coming out

817
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,439
of california now the one

818
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,439
that we are using

819
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,120
where the conditions tend to be drier

820
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,798
and they don't have you know as much

821
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,000
resistance as some of our eastern

822
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,398
cultivars

823
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,599
and seascape is one that is really

824
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,558
susceptible

825
00:29:53,599 --> 00:30:00,079
um we haven't seen this on on brambles

826
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,079
in pennsylvania so far

827
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,399
and these are some photos of seascape

828
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,119
from a grower tunnel where the plants

829
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,479
were grown in a gutter system

830
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,278
and they were

831
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,278
very um packed in there pretty tightly

832
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:16,398
and so we did see

833
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:20,000
some issues with that um

834
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:22,479
we've also seen it um on

835
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,839
well seascape but also in a greenhouse

836
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,919
setup that

837
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,119
is just a small scale one

838
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,240
um in

839
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,239
in pennsylvania

840
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,158
and so the um things that are important

841
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,079
for management or to increase

842
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,720
ventilation and air flow as much as

843
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,319
possible we may be fortunate in that on

844
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,120
both of our research sites we have very

845
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,960
windy conditions um and so we haven't

846
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:48,558
seen that much in a way of problems

847
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,519
lately early on we had seen some issues

848
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:53,759
and we did use a biofungicide

849
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,000
um called a q10 i believe there were

850
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,079
some um was a trial done in new york

851
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,599
with cucurbits

852
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,158
where it seemed to work for powdery

853
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,558
mildew on that as well i think that was

854
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,120
a detached leaf study though this was on

855
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,798
actual plants we only used it one time

856
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,879
so we don't really have a lot you know

857
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,759
to compare it anything to compare it to

858
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,399
really so that was just an observation

859
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,079
um our one of our plant pathologists

860
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,639
will say you know if you have problems

861
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:23,278
you can you can help wash the spores off

862
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,440
from the leaves if you use water um i do

863
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,119
want to warn folks that i do know of one

864
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,159
grower who had used

865
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,158
a potassium bicarbonate product um he

866
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,080
was actually trying to control mites but

867
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,360
potassium bicarbonate is for powdery

868
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,439
mildew

869
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,038
um it works on powdery mildew but when

870
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,679
he applied it under high temperature

871
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,599
conditions um the raspberries fell off

872
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,798
of his leaves in a high tunnel so i

873
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,480
don't know if that's something that

874
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:50,558
would happen very very frequently but

875
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,798
you'd be aware of that another disease

876
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,960
we see is lately frost this is not a

877
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,519
systemic rust so it's not like you need

878
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,880
to pull the plants out to

879
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,880
to um take care of the problem um some

880
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,799
spruce trees are an alternate host on

881
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,039
this one but once it gets on the

882
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,200
raspberries it can persist

883
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,200
um historically it's mainly been a

884
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,600
problem for red raspberries but we know

885
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,399
black raspberries can be affected too

886
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,918
and so we've seen an anjul on a nywat

887
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:19,839
and a tunnel

888
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,919
um mainly we've seen it on the leaves

889
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,759
and it has it has affected some of the

890
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,559
fruit but it hasn't been a big enough

891
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,558
problem yet to to worry about treating

892
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:30,720
it when we were in a tunnel tunnel

893
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,678
situation we saw it more so out in the

894
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,360
field though on the fruit

895
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,200
and then i want to mention this is one

896
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:40,000
that hopefully you can see what we're

897
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,240
looking at here um the contrast and this

898
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,798
photo's kind of tough but um plato's

899
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,480
thorium um we see this on raspberries

900
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,679
there are two different species that

901
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,480
cause it

902
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,278
and so it has some a velvety green

903
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,440
growth will show up on it and so

904
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:57,679
i'm hopefully you can see my my cursor

905
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,679
here but um what we're looking at is

906
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,759
sometimes it'll be on the receptacles

907
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,440
and some that are just hanging out there

908
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,759
so it's sort of a velvety green color

909
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,120
right here and you can also see one

910
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,599
fruit that we had missed that was

911
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,199
affected by it back here so you might

912
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,439
think that would be grey mold but that

913
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,840
was actually cladosporium

914
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,480
and then sometimes folks will see that

915
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,240
there are just little splotches around

916
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,319
the rim of the raspberry which you're

917
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,120
not seeing on this one here but what it

918
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,079
is

919
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:28,558
caused by is that sometimes the anthers

920
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,398
get infected by it and then if you have

921
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,798
moist conditions and they lay on the

922
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:34,558
fruit you get these little splotches of

923
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,720
plato's foreign

924
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:39,200
around the rim of the berry and these

925
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,960
are really just on the surface but they

926
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,960
still affect the

927
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,960
um marketability in fact the disease

928
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,278
itself tends to be just on the surface

929
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:54,079
and it can be um rubbed off actually so

930
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:56,480
anyway so that's one that we do see um

931
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:59,359
oh in in tunnels occasionally it is a

932
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,960
common um fungus in the environment it's

933
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:03,678
just one of those things that's sort of

934
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,558
around and it didn't normally

935
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,079
cause problems in the past but part of

936
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,878
the reason we think we might be seeing

937
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,599
it now um is that it is associated with

938
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:16,159
spotted wing drosophila and it can be in

939
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,280
its digestive tract and it may be

940
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,559
um that when spotted wing drosophila is

941
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,480
moving around or feeding on fruit or

942
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,480
ovipositing it might be introducing it

943
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,599
through the surface um you know there

944
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,119
could be multiple avenues where that is

945
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,519
affecting the fact that we're saying it

946
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,559
more so um so it's worst under high

947
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,119
humidity

948
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,679
tends to be worse or worse in the fall

949
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,280
when we have short days to reduce light

950
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,440
and less drying

951
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,440
so we um at this point we just recommend

952
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,838
trying to ventilate more and keeping the

953
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,159
fruit picked and then trying to control

954
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:52,719
spider-wing drosophila

955
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,398
as much as you can which we will

956
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,678
um which we will

957
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:56,638
talk about

958
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,039
also

959
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,119
so um so now we're going to move into

960
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,358
the insects so

961
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,960
um with spotted wing drosophila you know

962
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,119
we typically don't think of it as being

963
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,440
a huge problem in the northeast on our

964
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,760
june bearing strawberries because

965
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,559
um generally by the time the populations

966
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,200
build

967
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:17,199
we just don't see um you know we don't

968
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,279
see very much much of it we're through

969
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,358
the strawberry season

970
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,079
but with day neutrals either in the

971
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,880
field or in tunnels sometimes um

972
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,680
or if with very late season june bearing

973
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,200
cultivars folks will notice that there

974
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:35,598
are light soft spots um on the fruit now

975
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:37,199
that can be mistaken for sun scald but

976
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,320
if you're seeing it on the you know on

977
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,439
the

978
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,240
shady side of the row um it's probably

979
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,720
not

980
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:47,439
um or um they will mention that it seems

981
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:49,279
to them that the fruit is melting

982
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,800
and then this tends to become worse in

983
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,040
the fall because that's when the

984
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,519
population is built the highest

985
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,759
and so when that happens um you know you

986
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,239
can kind of tell yourself that it must

987
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,400
just have been the rain in the field or

988
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:05,358
something like that and maybe you don't

989
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,519
want to look too close but um

990
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,199
one thing i've learned over the years is

991
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,159
that looking at what you're going to eat

992
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:15,679
under a microscope is always a bad idea

993
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:17,759
but anyway so what we um see here in

994
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:20,319
this picture on the left and this was

995
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,960
taken under microscope is a strawberry

996
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,720
um you can tell that the color of of the

997
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,720
fruit is a little bit off it's a little

998
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,719
pinker you know than it than a normal

999
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,358
ripe berry would be so this is a soft

1000
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:34,719
area and if you look at it what you see

1001
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:36,239
is actually an egg and then um

1002
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,799
you know there

1003
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:42,078
are basically you know breathing tubes

1004
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,320
and so on so right here

1005
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,160
is where the egg is and you can see that

1006
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,400
under the surface of the fruit where it

1007
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:51,598
has been inserted

1008
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,240
and then over on the right um is an

1009
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,359
larvae in the fruit and so what you see

1010
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,559
are

1011
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:00,960
are basically um you know how it how it

1012
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,519
gets its air um with this little

1013
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,838
appendage up here in the air and you can

1014
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:11,358
kind of see right along here the outline

1015
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:13,519
of the larvae itself and so it goes

1016
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:16,559
right through here

1017
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:19,280
and so um so that's just something that

1018
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:21,679
you know we need to be aware of

1019
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,359
we can have issues with

1020
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,679
and then typically spotted will be a

1021
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,759
bigger problem in brambles and so again

1022
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:30,480
under the microscope this is blackberry

1023
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,400
where you can see a number of um eggs

1024
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,519
have been laid in these individual

1025
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,559
drooplets

1026
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,480
and right over here is an egg

1027
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:41,119
that you can see just underneath the

1028
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,719
surface and then this is where the fruit

1029
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,440
is softened

1030
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,000
and

1031
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,639
the skin was rubbed off and you see the

1032
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,679
larvae right here so not you know not

1033
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:54,480
what we want to see and then generally

1034
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,000
um if the um

1035
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,920
when the spiderweight goes through

1036
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,838
publication you will see a pupa

1037
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,920
typically these will drop to the ground

1038
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,078
but here is one that is in a raspberry

1039
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,159
fruit

1040
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,320
anyway so adults will tend to um hide

1041
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,319
out this is in a tunnel where they're on

1042
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,320
the underside of the berry we were

1043
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,960
hoping with part of a trial that maybe

1044
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,599
we could find out whether we could use a

1045
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,079
plastic that would tend to you know make

1046
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,720
the population and the populations not

1047
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,119
one want to move into the tunnel so much

1048
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,239
which we did very much see with japanese

1049
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,039
beetle

1050
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,439
um

1051
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,519
but with spotted wing what we found was

1052
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,838
if we had a ultraviolet light

1053
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:37,039
transmitting plastics so something like

1054
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:40,559
tough flight for we did see lower adult

1055
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,400
adult populations but each adult lies

1056
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,400
lay so many eggs that it just didn't

1057
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,400
make any difference in the larval

1058
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,519
numbers by the time it was all said and

1059
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,800
done

1060
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,559
so so that one didn't work but

1061
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,119
so we've got to find a solution and it

1062
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,519
can't exclude with netting

1063
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,039
we do have some issues where the tunnels

1064
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:00,559
will tend to get pretty warm in

1065
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,719
pennsylvania and so the mites will

1066
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,719
multiply faster i do recommend

1067
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:06,799
harvesting frequently

1068
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,799
using good sanitation work at the

1069
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,200
university of maryland

1070
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,359
so that using landscape fabric can help

1071
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,519
so that you don't miss fruit

1072
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:16,880
and trust in pyganic are a couple of

1073
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,039
options

1074
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,920
and there is some movement towards some

1075
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,599
upcoming parasitoid releases so that may

1076
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,760
be a longer term

1077
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,240
solution for us

1078
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,720
and then i'm going to talk about mites

1079
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:32,000
so numbers can really you know explode

1080
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,919
under a tunnel

1081
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,639
um two spotted spider mites which you

1082
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,119
see on our left are our common one which

1083
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:41,519
tend to lay a lot of eggs sometimes

1084
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,039
we've had some issues with broad mites i

1085
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,039
just want to point out with them you

1086
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,599
need high magnification

1087
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,279
um this floral

1088
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,559
and fluorescence here is is really

1089
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,200
compressed

1090
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:56,480
and that was a symptom of broad mites

1091
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:58,480
and then this is what an egg looks like

1092
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,800
down here at the bottom

1093
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,880
where it's kind of a speckled looking

1094
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,920
egg but you need a microscope to see

1095
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,920
that

1096
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,318
we haven't seen issues with cyclamen

1097
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,240
mites yet um or

1098
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,480
carmen mites which would um actually

1099
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:15,039
just a color variation of two-spotted

1100
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,119
spider mite but they could they brought

1101
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:19,519
in on nursery stocks so we could see

1102
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,079
those as well

1103
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,239
so we um would release predators and

1104
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,880
they always seem to work first um

1105
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,479
two-spotted spider-mite unless we um

1106
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,720
refrigerated them

1107
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,920
which i'm talking to carol glenister she

1108
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,358
said no you're supposed to keep them

1109
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,800
cool not cold and so once we stopped

1110
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:38,639
doing that

1111
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,000
that solved that problem and then

1112
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,318
sometimes we would try to hold them

1113
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,639
overnight or you know for an extra day

1114
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:47,358
if we didn't release them right away um

1115
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,199
and that was a no-no also so this is

1116
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:51,039
what a predatory might looks like you

1117
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,000
can see right here

1118
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,960
moving moving around i'm looking for

1119
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,280
mites

1120
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,440
so if you want to release predators

1121
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,680
you'll need to

1122
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,920
talk to your supplier and be prepared

1123
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,679
for information on the size of the area

1124
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,079
you want to treat

1125
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,519
how big your problem is

1126
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,800
what your temperature and humidity

1127
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,639
ranges are

1128
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,480
and they can make a recommendation for

1129
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,799
what you can what you can use and they

1130
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,880
may recommend reducing the populations

1131
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,960
first with you know spraying plants with

1132
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:26,318
water or using insecticidal scope soap

1133
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,599
there is a good website also at cornell

1134
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:31,920
on bio controls and predators that has a

1135
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,760
lot of great information on it

1136
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,480
so if we released early we would use a

1137
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,119
combination of amniosulous felasis in

1138
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,119
california yes that gives longer term

1139
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,039
control so would we release that when we

1140
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,160
just see a few leaves that were looking

1141
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:48,960
like this with a little bit of stippling

1142
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:50,879
that worked well for longer term control

1143
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,880
and then if we had a really big outbreak

1144
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,960
when we weren't paying attention and we

1145
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,640
were able to get this one under control

1146
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,400
this not every plant looked like this

1147
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:02,960
but we um used phytosolus for simulus

1148
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,119
um but that gets really expensive when

1149
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,800
you try to release enough mites to clean

1150
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,119
something like that up

1151
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,039
so grips um here's a thrift feeding on

1152
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,358
earth rips feeding on a strawberry and

1153
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:16,318
you can see why it causes the bronzing

1154
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,239
because there is surface damage that

1155
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,800
it's causing there

1156
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,959
and um so that that bronzing is a

1157
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,039
problem on strawberries

1158
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,720
um sometimes they can cause the seeds to

1159
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,719
lift off if the

1160
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:31,039
fruit surface doesn't it can't expand

1161
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:32,639
enough because of damage um powdery

1162
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,079
mildew can cause the same thing and

1163
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,400
you'll notice this if you notice the

1164
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,920
seeds falling off look you can look for

1165
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,358
one of the two of those

1166
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,480
and then just the fact that they're

1167
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:44,639
around on raspberries and is an issue

1168
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,039
and then aphids um

1169
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,118
is another concern this is just an a um

1170
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:52,318
aphid population actually on a south

1171
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,920
whistle but you can also see a wasp here

1172
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:58,400
that it was peritonizing some of the um

1173
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,599
aphids and there's a parasitized one

1174
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,760
right there

1175
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,800
and so what worked well we we didn't

1176
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,880
really have issues at rock springs but

1177
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,359
there we always had a population of lace

1178
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,079
wings and hover flies

1179
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,159
um the larvae on them are predacious no

1180
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,079
so we've never used pesticides like 20

1181
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,159
years in our high tunnel environment and

1182
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,280
so we think we've just built up a good

1183
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:23,519
population of these beneficials we did

1184
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,079
have issues um atlantisville which is

1185
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,679
their southeast research station and so

1186
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,318
what we did there was we knocked them

1187
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,039
back with insecticidal soap

1188
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:33,279
with

1189
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,880
several sprays of that and then we moved

1190
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,119
some potted sweet alyssum into the

1191
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,280
tunnel um to attract beneficials and

1192
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,599
that seemed to help

1193
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,160
so typically our growers will keep these

1194
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,119
products on hand to try to knock things

1195
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:50,078
back if they need to quickly and trust

1196
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:53,200
gigantic and insecticidal soap

1197
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,039
and that's you know i will mention there

1198
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,639
but i do just want to say two to you

1199
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:58,960
know we need to keep our pollinators in

1200
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:01,039
mind when we're applying anything and i

1201
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,199
do just want to mention this is a black

1202
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,838
raspberry this hole in the end of a cane

1203
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:08,399
is actually a solitary bee egg chamber

1204
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:11,759
there are eggs in this in this cane they

1205
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,639
like a hollow soft um center to

1206
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,040
um you know to to cane or piece of wood

1207
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:18,159
or cardboard tube and that's not a hole

1208
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:20,838
made by a

1209
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:23,279
board so i just wanted folks to be

1210
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:24,880
aware so it looks like we're right at 10

1211
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,640
o'clock laura do we just want to do

1212
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,480
questions in the chat or how do you want

1213
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:31,598
to handle this

1214
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,400
um why don't we take a question or two

1215
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,880
if we have them i think there was um

1216
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,358
something about

1217
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,119
uh spider-wing drosophila fine issue

1218
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:42,880
during august and september and high

1219
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,050
tunnel i think we know the answer to

1220
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,800
that yes it is yes

1221
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:50,800
[Laughter]

1222
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,760
yes so

1223
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,240
does anybody else have another question

1224
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:00,880
regarding pest management or just

1225
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,879
general um container issues right now

1226
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,440
so um so question how can you tell the

1227
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,440
difference between the b egg chamber and

1228
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,599
the border hole so

1229
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,679
um so these will always be in the very

1230
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,800
tip of the cane and so what i will tell

1231
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,960
folks is to cut that cane about six or

1232
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,960
eight inches down

1233
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,599
and if it doesn't go any further than

1234
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,159
that then it's not aboard most you know

1235
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,760
our pest boards will turn tunnel

1236
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,078
further down in the cane and some of

1237
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,720
them will even get into the crown area

1238
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,480
and then if if it you know if it doesn't

1239
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:35,519
go any further than that then you know

1240
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,440
it is just a a b egg chamber and you can

1241
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:39,679
just let that hang out somewhere in your

1242
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,920
tunnel there that's safe so that they

1243
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:45,838
can hatch out

1244
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,440
so why don't i quickly um just introduce

1245
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,279
i'm going to share my screen as well but

1246
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,599
i'm going to introduce our next speaker

1247
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,920
thank you kathy so much

1248
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,640
i'm going to introduce our next speaker

1249
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,559
which kathy also introduced me to and

1250
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:00,799
that is mark mcdonald

1251
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,199
he started the bee tree berry farm in

1252
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,359
belafonte pennsylvania in 2012 with a

1253
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:07,439
small plot of strawberries which has now

1254
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:08,639
grown to 20 acres of sustainably

1255
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,960
cultivated

1256
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:14,559
berries and vegetables well good morning

1257
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,639
and thanks for having me um

1258
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,799
little background about about laura and

1259
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:19,920
myself we've only been farming now for

1260
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,760
10 years

1261
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,000
we got started a little

1262
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,079
a little later in life that

1263
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,358
than a lot of folks have

1264
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:32,000
i spent 32 years growing golf turf

1265
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,799
and laura spent some time

1266
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,519
working in a greenhouse

1267
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:41,119
at a farm market in york county so we do

1268
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,119
have a little bit of growing background

1269
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,358
and like you said we do have 20 acres

1270
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,960
that we planted with mixed berries and

1271
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,959
uh

1272
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,838
some vegetable crops a few fruit trees

1273
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,639
and

1274
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:58,639
couple of chickens

1275
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,159
our sales

1276
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,318
they all happen

1277
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:08,838
at two farmers markets

1278
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:13,358
we have a small

1279
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:15,119
csa and we also do you pick

1280
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,279
strawberries blueberries and

1281
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,358
elderberries

1282
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,359
um

1283
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:24,480
one thing that we noticed early on when

1284
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:26,719
we were first starting uh our first

1285
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,880
couple of years growing strawberries

1286
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,799
was the uh

1287
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,160
just how everyone everyone wanted them

1288
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,920
and this couldn't get enough um

1289
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,519
so we were looking for ways to extend

1290
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,838
that season

1291
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:39,838
and

1292
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:47,920
we went into uh our first day neutral

1293
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:50,959
third of an acre planting on plastic

1294
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,680
in 2014 i believe

1295
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:57,039
and and we tried to grow

1296
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,799
on plastic uh for about four years and

1297
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,440
um

1298
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,280
with organic inputs uh it made it very

1299
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,838
difficult to control the anthracnose

1300
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,400
primarily

1301
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:09,920
um

1302
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,599
i found it very hard to to have a a

1303
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,838
a good harvestable crop to take the

1304
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,599
market on a weekly basis

1305
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:18,318
so

1306
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,000
with that uh we actually went to see

1307
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:22,400
kathy one

1308
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,719
i think it was october

1309
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,920
probably of 2017

1310
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,239
maybe

1311
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,519
and uh

1312
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,399
we went to look at her low tunnel

1313
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,079
production and while we were there

1314
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,680
she showed us what was going on in the

1315
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,839
high tunnels and that really intrigued

1316
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,838
us

1317
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,880
um

1318
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:42,879
so we

1319
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:48,880
started the next spring uh with some uh

1320
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,119
um

1321
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,838
high tunnel production

1322
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,838
and uh

1323
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:01,118
you can see here that our first year we

1324
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,480
were growing

1325
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,440
in bags

1326
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,800
uh on the ground

1327
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:12,000
and uh we also had some raspberries

1328
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,559
in the background there as well um

1329
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,679
we were growing albion

1330
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,839
in in one gallon bags and this is just a

1331
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:22,558
two by four frame with some

1332
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:24,400
with some fencing on it to support the

1333
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,359
bags

1334
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:32,160
and those bags are

1335
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:32,159
12 to 14 inches on center so

1336
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:37,199
we also had 30 raspberries in the back

1337
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:39,599
there they were grown in

1338
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:42,239
three gallon pots

1339
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,519
again with with holes drainage holes in

1340
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:48,000
them and and

1341
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:49,599
everything was fed with a 2720 from

1342
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,039
nutriculture

1343
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,559
and

1344
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:54,400
again this was due to our high

1345
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,559
alkalinity water that we had to deal

1346
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,559
with

1347
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:59,719
so

1348
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:08,159
uh our growing mix was uh

1349
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,679
the two to one pete the perlite

1350
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,078
and uh

1351
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:14,960
you can see here this is our our initial

1352
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,720
this is probably our first week of

1353
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,280
of uh

1354
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:22,000
planting uh typically we'll get our our

1355
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,359
plants the first week of april

1356
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,280
and try to get them in the ground within

1357
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,838
10 days of receiving

1358
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,599
so we'll stick them in

1359
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,679
on our on our

1360
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:34,400
benches which you can see now are are

1361
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,399
now raised

1362
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:39,118
and you can see we're growing

1363
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,440
strictly strawberries in this tunnel

1364
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,680
nail the raspberries are

1365
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,119
out we actually divided them up and and

1366
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:46,239
put them out in the field a couple years

1367
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,400
ago

1368
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:51,679
so we used the pots that the raspberries

1369
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,680
were in and raised the benches

1370
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:56,959
which was a a nice aspect um

1371
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:00,318
makes picking a little easier you're

1372
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,760
still bent over a little bit but you're

1373
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:03,119
not crawling on the ground which is kind

1374
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,440
of nice

1375
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,440
um

1376
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,640
let's see

1377
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:12,800
so yeah you can also you can see now

1378
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,879
we're growing in pots and in one gallon

1379
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,079
trade pots as opposed to the one gallon

1380
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,280
bags

1381
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:22,480
uh our first two years we grew

1382
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,559
in in the white bags with the black

1383
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,920
white on black bag

1384
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,440
and uh

1385
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,200
didn't like the kind of the fact that we

1386
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,240
had to throw everything away

1387
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:34,480
so we we've gone to the black pots

1388
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:36,558
um

1389
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,199
for two years now

1390
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,680
and uh

1391
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:43,279
it seems to be working out okay uh we're

1392
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:45,440
actually gonna split it again this year

1393
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,839
i'm gonna go 50 50 with the with the

1394
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,440
white bags to the black pots and try and

1395
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,960
get dialed in as to what really works

1396
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,119
best for us

1397
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,440
because we're still again this will be

1398
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,838
our fifth season and we still have a lot

1399
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,838
to learn

1400
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:06,400
i guess the biggest problem that we've

1401
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,240
had

1402
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,240
other than than crawling along the

1403
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:14,239
ground to pick and again we've

1404
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:16,318
eliminated that with raising the pots

1405
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:17,519
we did we have had some powdery mildew

1406
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:22,000
issues

1407
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:24,719
and a little bit of thrip problem

1408
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,639
nothing major nothing really really

1409
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:30,558
crazy but

1410
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:30,558
enough to have an impact on our harvest

1411
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:35,358
and fertility our uh our irrigation

1412
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,960
water is is uh

1413
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:39,759
really not up to

1414
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,639
the standards that we'd like um

1415
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,880
so we do have to really pay attention to

1416
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:47,358
how we're feeding

1417
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,160
um our harvests

1418
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:50,639
are

1419
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:50,639
our uh

1420
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,760
i guess our first year data we didn't

1421
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:59,440
really have any any real uh information

1422
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,440
on our first year harvest um

1423
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,079
in 2018 uh

1424
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,079
2019

1425
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:11,599
uh we had a uh

1426
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:15,760
1046 marketable pints and i i need to

1427
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:18,480
mention that we do have we have 700 pods

1428
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,480
so uh

1429
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:24,639
we were getting

1430
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:27,280
that was about 732 pounds uh

1431
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:30,078
our first year that was an average of

1432
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,800
of 0.7 pounds per

1433
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:35,839
per pint which is how we

1434
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:38,480
we measure our yield because we do sell

1435
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,480
by the pint

1436
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:43,838
so i see a question about plant runners

1437
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,000
um

1438
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:46,000
we

1439
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:52,000
basically when they get in my way uh

1440
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,159
going down the aisles if they're if

1441
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,358
they're if i'm tripping over them which

1442
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:58,078
will happen

1443
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:59,519
later in the season

1444
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,760
i remove them

1445
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:04,000
we do go through once and and pick the

1446
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,119
first flowers

1447
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
and we do

1448
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,880
one major

1449
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
cutting of runners uh early on in the

1450
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,838
season

1451
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,519
but after that we pretty much let them

1452
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,318
go and again unless they're they're in

1453
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:20,960
our way then we uh take care of them

1454
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:20,960
but um

1455
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,039
for our second

1456
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,599
our second year on these raised benches

1457
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:30,639
and uh in the black pots we changed our

1458
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,519
mix

1459
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:35,279
uh away from the the uh pete perlite mix

1460
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:36,880
that had been recommended

1461
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,480
and we went with uh

1462
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,240
a bag mix bk25

1463
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,079
and

1464
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:47,519
all the same fertility programs same

1465
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:50,000
planting programs etc and our yield

1466
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:50,000
increased

1467
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,078
from a pound per plant to 1.3 pounds per

1468
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:55,440
plant

1469
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,760
so

1470
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,920
you know again we're getting uh

1471
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,079
i got

1472
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,000
1273 marketable pints

1473
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,640
out of this little this little thousand

1474
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,159
square feet 1100 square feet of of the

1475
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:13,199
growing space

1476
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:13,199
which you know it's not a lot of of

1477
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:16,318
poundage

1478
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,199
but when you're when you're looking at

1479
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:19,358
uh

1480
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:20,558
the return on investment

1481
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:22,558
um

1482
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,119
you know we were able to get six dollars

1483
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,440
a pint uh at market

1484
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,440
um

1485
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:32,079
for our for our day neutrals

1486
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,240
and uh that's that's a pretty good i

1487
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,680
think that's a pretty good return uh

1488
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:38,399
four thousand square a little over a

1489
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:40,078
thousand square feet of growing space

1490
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,559
um

1491
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,880
last year we had a little issue again we

1492
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,839
went back to pete perlight

1493
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,798
um

1494
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:51,719
and

1495
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:54,000
we we harvested

1496
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:55,519
155 pounds

1497
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,440
last year um

1498
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,280
we actually turned the water off in

1499
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,318
early september because it just there

1500
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,599
was no flower production

1501
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:08,000
late mid-season on we had some

1502
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,440
this is this is last year we had a

1503
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,199
little bit of fruit early and some

1504
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,200
flower production early

1505
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:15,519
and

1506
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:18,078
as the season went on

1507
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:20,079
our flower production basically stopped

1508
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,240
so we just couldn't see the the need to

1509
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,920
continue with it last year so

1510
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:27,439
we have ordered plants again for this

1511
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,400
year uh albion again

1512
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,200
our thoughts are to go on um

1513
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,079
back with the bk25

1514
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:36,078
and uh

1515
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,119
again i want to split it up with with

1516
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:44,480
the bags versus the pots

1517
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,720
keep up with the same fertility program

1518
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,920
and see where it takes us

1519
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:49,519
something else we're thinking about

1520
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,599
doing this year

1521
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:53,599
is

1522
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,480
putting up a small caterpillar

1523
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,200
tunnel

1524
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,519
and growing day neutrals directly in

1525
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:01,199
soil under plastic

1526
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:03,119
we're still debating what to do with

1527
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:05,358
that

1528
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,358
so

1529
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,119
i guess our

1530
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,720
i guess i can answer any questions uh if

1531
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,480
you have if you have any

1532
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:20,798
uh please

1533
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,838
thanks mark that was great and there are

1534
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:25,599
some questions in the chat box and um i

1535
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:27,440
don't know if you guys are if i'm

1536
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:30,000
sharing everything or what i'm sharing

1537
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,920
actually but um there was a question

1538
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,719
from chuck mead about flavor and

1539
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:37,358
firmness comparing greenhouse

1540
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,519
and tunnel versus the field fruit did

1541
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:42,639
you have any comments on that

1542
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:43,920
yeah like like neil was saying earlier

1543
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:46,480
um

1544
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,720
the the early berries in the tunnel

1545
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,719
um

1546
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,798
really are are are not up to

1547
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:57,440
the field flavor uh

1548
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:59,119
so if you can continue to grow

1549
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,119
throughout the in the field a little

1550
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,240
later maybe with melvina or something

1551
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:04,559
like that

1552
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,318
it'll get you into at least

1553
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,319
a time where the tunnel berries start to

1554
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,400
pick up in flavor really mid-august you

1555
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:13,440
really notice a big change

1556
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,880
in the flavor and once once mid-august

1557
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,798
september get there

1558
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,160
they're probably the best berries

1559
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:22,559
flavor-wise that we have all season

1560
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,719
great thank you and then you talked

1561
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,960
about the plant runners and then mike

1562
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:28,798
knuckles this is actually uh close to

1563
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,838
what you were just saying the harvest

1564
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:32,798
season

1565
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:34,639
start and stopping when what is your

1566
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:37,119
like average starting and average

1567
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:38,960
stopping in the in the tunnel

1568
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,559
well again we'll start

1569
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,280
when berries are present we'll harvest

1570
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,440
them

1571
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,798
uh so we'll start harvesting in june

1572
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,519
late

1573
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:48,838
third week fourth week of june and we've

1574
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:50,960
gone as far as

1575
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:53,358
thanksgiving it all it all depends on

1576
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:57,199
the year basically and now obviously the

1577
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:59,519
yields uh early and later are are small

1578
00:58:57,199 --> 00:58:59,519
um

1579
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,400
our biggest

1580
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,079
i'm trying to see uh

1581
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,720
august and september

1582
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:11,359
typically are our our best

1583
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:13,039
months for harvest for the biggest yield

1584
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:15,598
but um

1585
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:17,440
we do have berries available i've taken

1586
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,960
them to farmers market

1587
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,119
until the middle of the middle of

1588
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,880
november

1589
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,760
great

1590
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,838
um jim has a question about changes with

1591
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,680
the media just wondering if you've

1592
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:32,239
finally if you've settled on something

1593
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:34,399
that you really like or

1594
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:36,399
you're just kind of still experimenting

1595
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,160
yeah we're still trying to figure that

1596
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,000
out uh we actually did a little work

1597
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:42,558
with kathy last year

1598
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,358
she was doing a media study

1599
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,798
uh

1600
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:46,639
atlantisville

1601
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:48,960
and we did a few

1602
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:51,519
uh pots here as well with the same

1603
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,039
products and unfortunately our yields

1604
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:56,318
last year just didn't work out uh

1605
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:59,119
because of our flowering issue but um

1606
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:00,880
there was a core product uh

1607
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:04,640
that

1608
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:06,400
our plants look good growing in it um

1609
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:08,960
i'm going to talk i want to get some

1610
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,440
information hopefully

1611
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,280
on how their yields were down

1612
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,200
at the research farm

1613
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,519
um and go from there but right now i

1614
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:20,159
think we're going to stick with bk25

1615
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:21,838
unless we we see some

1616
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:23,759
good information coming out of their

1617
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:25,279
study

1618
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,720
all right great

1619
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,640
um if

1620
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:31,439
before we answer the last two questions

1621
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:33,199
i i wondering if andy or natasha could

1622
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:37,280
put the

1623
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:39,199
link to the dec credit survey which

1624
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,440
folks have to do that

1625
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:43,519
at the end of the session

1626
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,519
and in order to get the dc credits but

1627
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:46,639
we can keep talking about some of these

1628
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:48,559
questions

1629
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:53,118
and we have a question about any problem

1630
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,119
with kinking of the fruit trusses

1631
01:00:54,159 --> 01:01:00,480
thinking of the fruit trusses not uh

1632
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:02,720
not something we've experienced

1633
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,719
now

1634
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:09,119
okay that that has been a problem

1635
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,680
um for some people that they will sit on

1636
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:14,000
that edge of the pot

1637
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:15,598
and they can you know just because of

1638
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,760
weight of the fruit or

1639
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,359
the sharpness of the edge to provide a

1640
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,040
little kink and it kind of shuts off

1641
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:25,920
everything to that fruit um as it grows

1642
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:27,599
so that is something to be aware of

1643
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,358
i was going to say we've we've seen that

1644
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,359
in some of our greenhouse strawberries

1645
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:33,838
and so we've ended up moving to this

1646
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:35,119
trough that has a smooth kind of curved

1647
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:36,798
edge

1648
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:39,680
and that helps and then otherwise i've

1649
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:42,318
seen some growers um run tape not sticky

1650
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:42,318
tape but like

1651
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,079
uh raised up a little bit so they can

1652
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,838
they can position the trusses kind of

1653
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,839
resting on that soft tape

1654
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:55,599
and laura can can i jump in with a few

1655
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:58,318
things too so um so first on the fruit

1656
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:00,318
trusses yeah so helping keep the media a

1657
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,960
little higher will can help with that

1658
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:04,798
too if that settles into the pots

1659
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,358
then the trusses are up and then they're

1660
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:09,119
bending over so so that's one thing that

1661
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:10,880
can help um and that's part of the

1662
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,640
reason that we are still with bags it's

1663
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,240
just they just sort of

1664
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:17,279
you know fold down

1665
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:19,439
um as far as the low yields i

1666
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,559
i was having some conversations with

1667
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,798
mark pritz and also kim lures atlantis

1668
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,480
film or plantersville beltsville for

1669
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:27,519
some reason they were saying really high

1670
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,519
they knew

1671
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:31,440
yeah they were seeing less flowering

1672
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:32,639
last year

1673
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,318
we didn't really have that problem at

1674
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:36,639
landisville so we have no idea what's

1675
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:38,880
going on it seemed very hit or miss and

1676
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:41,519
so i don't i don't know what what was

1677
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,000
going on there you know um

1678
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:46,639
with mark's because we i think we had

1679
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,400
the same plant source and so that was

1680
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:50,480
really baffling

1681
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,559
um and then when i and out of our trial

1682
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,519
atlantisville so what worked really well

1683
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,319
as far as the media goes um

1684
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:56,599
is

1685
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:57,838
um

1686
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:01,118
[Music]

1687
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:03,358
it's called bc5 plus plus it's actually

1688
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:05,200
the media they're using in ontario and

1689
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:07,119
the netherlands and it's a very

1690
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:09,279
different mix that one worked really

1691
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:12,480
well for us better than anything else we

1692
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:14,720
had tried and the two to one people like

1693
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,599
um was really at the bottom

1694
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:20,078
for in that trial other ones did better

1695
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:22,720
we tried five other five other ones but

1696
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,240
that bc5 then was the sixth one and that

1697
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:27,358
one did the best

1698
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:29,199
um and then the other thing is that with

1699
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:31,119
some and we're working with folks at the

1700
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:33,118
hershey school they've actually moved to

1701
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,119
using a petunia feed which provides a

1702
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,280
lot more iron that helps

1703
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,960
there's also another new fertilizer out

1704
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:41,359
of ico

1705
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:44,480
i think it is that has a lot more iron

1706
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:46,639
and micronutrients and in forms that are

1707
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,079
available at higher ph's if you get into

1708
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:50,000
issues so next you're going to be

1709
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:52,798
looking at some of our best media with

1710
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,119
our best fertilizers and

1711
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:57,599
try to get a better handle on that so we

1712
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,838
can hopefully you know answer these

1713
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,838
questions

1714
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:04,558
that's great and i know about william

1715
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,880
has a question that doesn't look like a

1716
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:08,798
very quick question but possibly um

1717
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,318
you're for what is your fertility

1718
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:12,960
program

1719
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:14,880
and i want to say while uh mark is

1720
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,880
formulating an answer for that i would

1721
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,358
like to encourage people we don't have a

1722
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,640
formal evaluation which is is my

1723
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:22,960
oversight

1724
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:24,798
however i would we we're going to try to

1725
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,240
put something together but if you have a

1726
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:27,759
thought while you're sitting here

1727
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:31,598
thinking about these

1728
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:33,760
um questions please put topics that you

1729
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,838
would like if for instance if you want

1730
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,400
to see more in-depth information on

1731
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:40,880
container culture now's the time to tell

1732
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,720
us so that we can try to

1733
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,280
follow up on that but

1734
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:48,000
uh mark i don't know if you can

1735
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:50,640
do that uh question justice in a minute

1736
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,440
or two about the fertility program

1737
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:55,358
ours is really simple uh basically we'll

1738
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,240
start the year with with the plant

1739
01:04:55,358 --> 01:05:01,279
marvel 27 20

1740
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:03,519
for high alkalinity soil or water

1741
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:06,400
and and stick with it um if we have an

1742
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:06,400
issue i'll add a little

1743
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:11,359
take uh something with a little

1744
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,400
manganese and iron in it uh to take care

1745
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:16,000
of some some chlorotic looking issues

1746
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,119
but other than that

1747
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,119
um

1748
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:22,358
that's that's pretty much it for us

1749
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,358
pretty simple

1750
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,720
well thank you i i don't want to cut

1751
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:31,759
this short but we're about seven minutes

1752
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:34,959
over our time to adjourn i really want

1753
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,799
to thank our speakers um it's a this is

1754
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,199
something that growers are always asking

1755
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:41,759
me about and i'm really happy we have

1756
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:44,399
expertise and a

1757
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,400
grower that's willing to share um you

1758
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,079
know what's going on there so thank you

1759
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,318

we will

1761
