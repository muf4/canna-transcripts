1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,330
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:05,330
University

3
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:15,609
just to kind of frame this I think that

4
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:18,460
we started with the recognition that we

5
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:20,710
had some shared needs and we definitely

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,750
had some needs for new resources here at

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,640
the county level that realized that

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:29,140
maybe some of those resources would

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,969
serve on a statewide level so as we

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,820
developed our pollinator garden I

11
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:36,100
reached out to Sarah and said hey we

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,009
have some grant funding can we

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,558
collaborate on

14
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:43,329
on curated or you know interpretive

15
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:45,549
signage for these pollinator gardens

16
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:47,320
because I don't know if you all are kind

17
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:50,018
of like us and that a lot of what we do

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,210
is what we can print on our printers and

19
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:54,158
what we can laminate on our laminators

20
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:58,048
and that's as big as as it gets and as

21
00:00:54,158 --> 00:01:01,600
designed as it get so so those kind of

22
00:00:58,048 --> 00:01:03,368
those kind of signs are not I think

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,859
they're great but they're not they don't

24
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:08,560
say hey this is a this is a garden this

25
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:11,340
is a learning space come on in and they

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,228
flap in the wind and they float away so

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,149
recognizing that we had some parallel

28
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:18,759
needs and we could develop these shared

29
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:20,978
resources I pulled a whole bunch of

30
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,989
people across the state and said hey

31
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:26,438
who's doing a pollinator garden this

32
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:29,468
year in terms of your extension duties

33
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:32,648
and a number were and would you like

34
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:36,358
signage so based on that we launched

35
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:38,799
into this collaborative process

36
00:01:36,358 --> 00:01:40,449
which like many other things sort of

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,549
took longer than we expected because

38
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,539
life happens and then fairs happen and

39
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:46,149
then people go you know we're on

40
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:47,259
vacations and it took a couple of months

41
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:49,748
but we came up with some really

42
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:53,140
beautiful things and in doing that also

43
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:56,259
ended up developing a shared photo

44
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:59,228
library for other Extension educators to

45
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:02,019
use as well so out of it came this

46
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:04,599
wonderful set of products that I'm

47
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:06,759
really excited to be able to share with

48
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,618
people but as along with that are the

49
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,169
parallel photos that people could be

50
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:13,750
using and the parallel educators

51
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:15,068
resources that go along with it so

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,318
hopefully it's something that you can

53
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:19,479
just pick up for your program and take

54
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:23,318
what parts you need and it makes your

55
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:26,908
life easier so how this was at a good

56
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:30,218
reduction Sarah yes what fun okay

57
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:34,030
so we are storing a lot of stuff in box

58
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:36,400
so so Sarah if you want you could I'll

59
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,139
I'll be your clicker and you talk and

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,989
I'll click on what you'd like me to show

61
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:43,269
how's that okay so essentially what

62
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:46,030
you're about to look at is that like Jen

63
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:47,920
just mentioned she pulled lots of people

64
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,750
around the county to say you know what

65
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,789
kind of concepts you want to communicate

66
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:58,000
in in your gardens and from that

67
00:02:53,789 --> 00:03:00,638
created draft of text that then I took

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,859
and and looked at and said I made some

69
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,269
suggestions as to how to organize it and

70
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:06,609
what we did is we came up with four

71
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:10,239
different signs with four different

72
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:11,949
concepts and in my mind the do you mind

73
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,669
clicking on the pollinator paradise one

74
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:17,019
first Jen sure

75
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:19,299
you know this is these four signs are

76
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,579
kind of like a menu of you could use all

77
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,510
of them you could use one or you can

78
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:24,010
select the ones that are most

79
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:26,979
appropriate for what you're displaying

80
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:29,348
in your garden but to me the pollinator

81
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:32,048
paradise is kind of the intro type of

82
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:35,228
sign that that kind of gives the why

83
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:38,409
behind you know it's at what it what is

84
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:39,599
the significance of making your home

85
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:43,298
landscape

86
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,888
pollinator friendly and so what you're

87
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:47,229
what you're seeing right now is the

88
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:49,780
graphic layout for that particular sign

89
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:51,879
and it has like a fun title that Jen

90
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,400
came up with and then it says you know

91
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:56,530
explore this garden to learn how you can

92
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,229
create pollinator habitat at home so

93
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,060
that's our main idea pretty much for all

94
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:03,849
of the signs but this one in particular

95
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,009
kind of gives gives the overview I mean

96
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:07,238
in the paragraph follow I won't read

97
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:10,779
everything word-for-word but the

98
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:13,030
paragraph following that you know sites

99
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,060
the significance for why it's important

100
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,848
to have pollinators they pollinate all

101
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,728
the plants we depend on for food and for

102
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:22,750
healthy ecosystems

103
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,788
underneath that it gives like a nice

104
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,620
just

105
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:29,560
basic here's what pollinators need and

106
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,418
all of all of the signs direct people to

107
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,879
more information three of the four have

108
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:37,028
QR codes so if people have smartphones

109
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,709
and like to use their QR we reader to

110
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:40,048
access more information and website they

111
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:42,668
could do so

112
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:44,348
the main idea behind these signs is to

113
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:47,258
really entice people with beautiful

114
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:49,209
images and not look intimidating like

115
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,799
there's too much text all jumbled

116
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:52,889
together but people can kind of pick and

117
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:55,928
choose the information they want to read

118
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:57,819
so the goal of this particular sign not

119
00:04:55,928 --> 00:05:00,188
only to just you know let people know

120
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:02,528
hey it's a really good idea to landscape

121
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:03,899
your Agard your home landscape with

122
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:07,598
pollinator friendly

123
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:10,059
plants and also other aspects of it but

124
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:12,248
also like encourage them to say hey you

125
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:14,769
can do this and even you know go to the

126
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:16,539
0:c Society website and you can purchase

127
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:18,548
a neat little sign yourself that says

128
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:21,668
hey I'm doing this to make my pollinator

129
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:24,308
habitat friendly so those are the two

130
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:27,878
main concepts on this side and we were

131
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:29,949
lucky that Jen asked people around the

132
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,849
state to upload photos that they would

133
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:37,718
not mind us using so I had like 60 at

134
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:40,468
least images to choose from five so that

135
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:43,028
was like our main

136
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:45,389
I just felt like let's celebrate the

137
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:48,129
photos so

138
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,658
beautiful yeah I don't know if we should

139
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:51,519
oh go ahead which agenda do you want to

140
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:53,618
add something well a lot of educators

141
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,269
had noted over the last couple years

142
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:57,550
talking to educators around the state

143
00:05:55,269 --> 00:06:00,668
that using finding photographs that we

144
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:04,179
have permission to use has been hard and

145
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:05,829
as we put more stuff on the web and it's

146
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:07,718
more like publishing and then suddenly

147
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:10,059
we get into issues with do we have

148
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:12,189
permission to use a photo so building

149
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:14,379
this photo library was a nice kind of

150
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:16,479
corollary you know thing to this because

151
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:18,908
it's something that we've needed but how

152
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:21,308
do you ever devote the time to it well

153
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:23,588
the need and having some grant funding

154
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:25,179
towards that is one of the you know one

155
00:06:23,588 --> 00:06:27,399
of the things that helps you do it

156
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:29,738
incrementally so yay we've got

157
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,478
pollinator photos you know next what do

158
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:34,178
we you know what do we need to collect

159
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,459
so that was really great to to grow our

160
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:38,348
photo library that way so and also it

161
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:40,269
was nice about that is that they every

162
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:42,188
single photographer probably thanks to

163
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:45,158
your direction put their name as the

164
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:47,079
file name yeah so that it was easy to

165
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:49,688
credit everybody without saying hey I

166
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:52,180
want to use this you know be on the

167
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:55,090
Rebecca image who can you tell me who is

168
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,788
it was so he compared so all the photos

169
00:06:55,089 --> 00:07:01,269
are properly credited to the

170
00:06:57,788 --> 00:07:04,300
photographer's too so and and that photo

171
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:07,299
library will also be stored on the CCE

172
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,310
shared resource library that we're that

173
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,060
we've been piloting now for a while so

174
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:15,519
people can use them as well oh

175
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,410
okay or should I close this one and open

176
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,549
a different one sure unless anyone has

177
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,099
any questions about this one in

178
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,098
particular

179
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:26,079
let me open the chat pod

180
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:29,199
and this is Joe Allen I'm just curious

181
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,029
why when you're listing the reasons that

182
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,919
pollinators are in decline that you

183
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:34,918
didn't include climate change oh

184
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:42,189
that's yes it was in there at some point

185
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,530
was it yes it was but I think what the

186
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:46,719
discussion was was habitat lost part of

187
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:48,519
the climate change discussion you know

188
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,240
what I mean that was that was that was

189
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:53,918
in there originally as a as a point but

190
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,038
then somebody made the point that that

191
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,079
the habitat loss well there's also you

192
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,908
know it's human

193
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,728
that that was the issue with the climate

194
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:05,550
climate change what would you agree on

195
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:08,158
that

196
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,449
yeah yeah I mean I

197
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:12,519
it were not alike no it can't be

198
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:14,199
emphasized by saying like habitat loss

199
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,649
partly you know in part due to climate

200
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,310
change it's not like we wanted not

201
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:19,959
emphasized you know we didn't purposely

202
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:24,728
try not to emphasize that climate change

203
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:26,739
is a factor I think it was more like we

204
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:28,468
just wanted to be like direct about like

205
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,908
you know

206
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:34,328
what is what they're having that loss

207
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:35,799
and tell you yeah right and also trying

208
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:37,629
to be succinct I mean we there was a lot

209
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,759
of text and you don't want to dumb it

210
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:40,990
down you also want it to be unassigned

211
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,049
you have to be really careful to make

212
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,430
sure you don't you put digestible

213
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,639
amounts of text that people are willing

214
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:50,319
to read

215
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,389
do people feel strongly that it belongs

216
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,879
in there no they want to be changing a

217
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:58,179
lot but it came up a couple of times and

218
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,909
that that was kind of how we how how it

219
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:03,419
how comments winnowed it back down to

220
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:06,549
this because we did try to keep it brief

221
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:08,409
what do you think well the other thing

222
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:10,240
is you might notice that underneath a

223
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:13,929
list of what pollinators need there's a

224
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,480
QR code that that QR code leads to a

225
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:17,979
website that Jen created that gives

226
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,769
because there was like a whole like

227
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,570
checklist of specific things you can do

228
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,819
in your garden so Jen made this really

229
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,170
great web page I don't know if it's

230
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,410
mentioned there or if it could be

231
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:31,299
expanded on there right because we

232
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:33,100
couldn't get it all in the signs and we

233
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:35,379
and then it becomes an additional

234
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,209
resource for educators a that it's a

235
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:40,480
colonial web page that you could ask

236
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:42,578
your web master in your association to

237
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,649
clone that web page and then you would

238
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:47,469
be able to

239
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:50,919
add stuff in there that you know means

240
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:54,600
something to your county versus having

241
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:56,819
to create the web page from scratch so

242
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,740
yeah

243
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,510
we could you know it is it is in there

244
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,698
but it could be brought up more and if

245
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:05,078
you think it is if no people think that

246
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:06,698
this is something to change the other

247
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:11,049
beautiful thing about this is that this

248
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:13,419
is PDF and everybody has PDF editors you

249
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:14,948
can edit the QR code and if there's

250
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:16,599
something really important in your

251
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,939
garden that you're trying to highlight

252
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,680
there might be something that you could

253
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,750
you know there are places that you can

254
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:26,109
put things that make it unique to your

255
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:28,328
garden so we could look at that too but

256
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,480
so JoEllen I don't know if that answers

257
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,479
your question

258
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:36,389
it does but I can definitely see that

259
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,420
it's a space issue I

260
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:42,309
don't consider habitat loss

261
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:44,078
to be directly tied to climate change

262
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,739
which is one of the reasons that I

263
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,969
thought it should be in there but

264
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,649
especially if you're referring to it in

265
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,259
other places that they could find as it

266
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:56,769
is let's see if we really do the hook I

267
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:58,509
mean the process so you start with a lot

268
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,610
of words and then you come down to fewer

269
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:03,069
and fewer words and then you know you do

270
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,278
in order to make it short enough that

271
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,949
people will read it you definitely lose

272
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,448
some ideas yeah I mean I wonder if it

273
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:11,889
could just be like right on that last

274
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:13,539
line in the introductory paragraph it

275
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:14,948
says you know many of these pollinators

276
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,779
are in decline especially bees and

277
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:19,269
butterflies due to habitat loss and

278
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:21,370
upper pesticide use comma disease and

279
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:23,340
climate change it might all fit nicely

280
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,649
I'm fine yeah

281
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:31,200
yep I bet it was if it was bit I would

282
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:31,199
said really like to see it in there yeah

283
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,919
okay I mean I'm coming from a person

284
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:36,849
who's you know like really trying to

285
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,579
elevate our climate change

286
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,029
interpretation here that I I don't to

287
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:45,340
make sure yeah like it won't do

288
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:47,079
no yeah change we can make we're not

289
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,940
going to really expand on that in the

290
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,129
sign anywhere but I think it's just this

291
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,700
just gives you the why behind it so I

292
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:58,179
think that's very appropriate yeah

293
00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:00,700
okay and and I if I I'm sharing my

294
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:03,549
screen I don't think I can actually add

295
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,040
a comment but if you look on any of

296
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:09,039
these box things you can add comments as

297
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:11,799
you use them say hey great I downloaded

298
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:15,730
it or this or that but we can't you

299
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:17,620
can't enter comments oh wait I can I can

300
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,620
add in climate change in there and that

301
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,259
will be a note for us too oh well if I

302
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,600
learn how to spell

303
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:28,559
[Laughter]

304
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,990
we know we don't you talk about me

305
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,399
okay so then I'll close this one is that

306
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,090
okay and then do you want to look at

307
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,159
another one in particular

308
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:41,019
no whatever you feel is the the order

309
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,759
that makes sense in your mind there

310
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,809
isn't any particular order of these

311
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:46,179
signs I just wanted to highlight that

312
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:47,649
the pollinator paradise was kind of if

313
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:49,809
you know you know you had a small garden

314
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:52,149
where you only had room for one to me I

315
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:55,539
felt like we just wanted to have a sign

316
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:57,699
that kind of you know was like just if

317
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:58,929
you were only to choose one to me that

318
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,860
would be the one that would make the

319
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:04,870
most sense that's all yeah and then this

320
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,830
I think the pesticides one because we

321
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:11,230
just talked about potentially

322
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:14,020
adding information to and this one has a

323
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,370
spot for adding and whoops I see if I

324
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:17,500
can get that little thing on the bottom

325
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:20,379
to go away but it's it may not go away

326
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,450
while you're looking at it this was a

327
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:25,860
sign right Sara that that you had some

328
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,860
room for additions

329
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,430
I think it was all seasons one where

330
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,438
people could put their own QR code to

331
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:36,328
create their own plant list is that what

332
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:38,639
you're talking about oh no on this one

333
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:42,269
you can write in on the right oh yes

334
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,339
yeah yeah Jen wanted a place where

335
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:46,318
people could could write a comment or

336
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:50,420
people could leave comments but you know

337
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:52,860
there might be a new a tip on you know

338
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:55,259
not having to use pests like in the

339
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,528
latest IPM practices that you might want

340
00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:00,899
to say hey check out this article or

341
00:13:57,528 --> 00:14:02,909
you could even laminate an article and

342
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,129
post it like the double-sided tape or

343
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:07,860
something but I was thinking like gel

344
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:10,259
markers like if these are created if

345
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,730
they're laminated that's very easy

346
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,009
because you can just use gel markers

347
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:16,409
right on top of that black space but if

348
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:18,930
you get them fabricated say at FedEx

349
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:21,059
Office or staples and it's just there's

350
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:22,409
usually a finish they put on it and the

351
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:23,838
gel markers that have been working

352
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:27,240
really well

353
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,040
with writing it on there and when it you

354
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,980
know when it dries it the rain doesn't

355
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,198
really affect it but it does take like a

356
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:38,149
simple green or just like a cleaning

357
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:40,278
solvent just to get it off there

358
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:42,629
great and that could be a space where

359
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:45,299
you know I think that this is a hot

360
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:47,670
topic often and there might be something

361
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:51,419
in the news or there might be a change

362
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:53,458
in pesticide labeling or whatever it

363
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:55,919
happens to be or even an upcoming

364
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:58,138
program that you want to highlight is

365
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:01,500
the spot where people could keep the

366
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:04,169
space alive you know it's a place to way

367
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,089
to change things or if you don't want to

368
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:08,099
change it you could pop something in

369
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:12,839
there again they're pdfs and all of us

370
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,939
have acrobat an editor PDF editor that

371
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,389
allows you to go in there and edit

372
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:20,458
things so

373
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:23,759
it's there it can be changed a little to

374
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:25,969
make it you know work for you so we did

375
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,350
write right up

376
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,778
you know places you could get them made

377
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:34,079
how you can mount them just the you know

378
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:36,778
the logistics of what the cost range is

379
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:39,000
we can go through that after is it okay

380
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:40,889
if we go through that yeah we're gonna

381
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,659
make sure we leave enough time for Holly

382
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:44,759
so maybe maybe actually we'll go through

383
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,919
that now I'll show you the signs quickly

384
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,710
just so you see them and how glorious

385
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:52,559
they are I'm sorry Sarah I think you did

386
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:56,730
an awesome job on them so and then the

387
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:58,589
photographer we had yeah yeah so this is

388
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,570
the idea be re go ahead generally you

389
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,080
know you go yep I would say the main

390
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:06,090
idea behind this one is to

391
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,310
further build on you know what

392
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:11,730
pollinators need is to really get into

393
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:14,039
the fact that having something in flower

394
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,110
throughout the growing season is very

395
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,599
important and this gets really into

396
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,029
specific to emphasize the fact that you

397
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,800
know certain insects really have

398
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:25,259
specialised with certain plants so the

399
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,659
far the right hand kind of shows how

400
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:32,039
there's specific relationships between

401
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:33,899
like Frankie I should know all these by

402
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,230
heart considering that I wrote type this

403
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:39,149
out but you can see the different

404
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,920
butterflies and then what they

405
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:42,840
specialize on but we also wanted to say

406
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,209
that it's you don't need just native

407
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,070
plants that have specialists that you

408
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,259
can also have lots of non natives if

409
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,180
they're in flower that really appeal to

410
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,000
generalists too so we want to emphasize

411
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:56,579
that on this sign and so this is the

412
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,799
sign in which there's a QR code that

413
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,460
says scan here to view a plant list on

414
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:05,430
our website and then it says www type

415
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:09,240
your website he org well I get behind

416
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:10,500
this one is that if you have a plant

417
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,838
list you'd like to post on your website

418
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,670
here's your opportunity to create that

419
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:18,990
page and then generate a QR code and

420
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:21,390
place it in over the QR card we have

421
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:24,088
here the QR code that's here currently

422
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:27,050
is the QR code for the website above

423
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:29,129
that talks about

424
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:30,930
plants and different regions that are

425
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,240
good good to plant like a whole variety

426
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,400
of pollinator so if you don't feel like

427
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,650
or don't want to make your own unique

428
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,710
plant list you could just take that text

429
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:43,080
away completely using the Adobe editor

430
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,490
and then just keep that a QR code that's

431
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,720
there does that make sense to people

432
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,579
because that's the one little tricky

433
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,240
part that I felt people might have

434
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:50,240
questions on

435
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,029
if that that's in the manual - so for

436
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,510
people who aren't on this phone call

437
00:17:56,029 --> 00:18:01,509
that would that's

438
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:01,509
explained

439
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:06,529
okay yeah we should go sorry I know I

440
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,109
talk too much and everyone I don't know

441
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:10,910
oh and then is this the one we didn't

442
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:13,329
look at these are essential yes that's

443
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,330
yep

444
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,140
there we go the focus of this one is

445
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:24,730
just on beast specifically to explain

446
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:27,020
how they're in great decline and how

447
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,120
there's difference between honey just

448
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:30,170
kind of dispelling the information that

449
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,979
a lot of people sometimes get confused

450
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:35,360
on you know what height what's honeybees

451
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,250
versus the fact that there's still

452
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,219
thousands of native bees in the United

453
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,750
States but honeybees have you know great

454
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,819
function here as well though they're

455
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:49,308
introduced so it gets more into

456
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:51,379
just why they're essential then you

457
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:54,440
talked about the honeybees versus native

458
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,150
bees and then also generally felt it

459
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,090
would be a good idea to you know a lot

460
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:03,320
of you guys have said that you know

461
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:04,789
really dispelling the fear that bees can

462
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:07,250
sting you and that you wouldn't want to

463
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:08,839
welcome these into your habitat but

464
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,960
letting people know that it's mostly

465
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:15,529
kala native colonists not colonnades er

466
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,299
Holly oh so social bees that are likely

467
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,869
protecting their colony and that would

468
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:23,839
provoke them to be more

469
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:26,959
apt to sting versus solitary bees so

470
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:29,149
trying to say hey regardless of the fact

471
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,150
that they you know have attended the

472
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,410
sting they're very important so that's

473
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,259
what we wanted to decay a whole sign

474
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:41,120
just to bees

475
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:43,329
um we wrote a just a two pager that just

476
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,329
says

477
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,120
everything we just discussed so while

478
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,200
we're here that there are there are

479
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:53,058
going to be a whole bunch of supporting

480
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,039
resources for educators also in a

481
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:56,990
resources for educators things so

482
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,389
handouts articles that you could just

483
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:02,240
use on your local newspaper somebody

484
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:04,880
shared with us an announcement for a

485
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,430
pollinator program you know and how they

486
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,760
how they did so we shared that as well

487
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:13,700
as a template for someone to borrow from

488
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:16,160
and just you know try yourself to do a

489
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,370
program like that I'm not sure that I

490
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,040
have it here but the guide it's not in

491
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:23,529
here yet but the guy does go through

492
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,930
what you would

493
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:28,940
what you would do in terms of how to

494
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,529
print it right Sarah print how to print

495
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,809
you what size to print it on who to get

496
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:35,750
from how to mount it what you need to

497
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:39,649
change so kind of guide to go along with

498
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:41,359
it hey Jen this is Laurie one of the

499
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,550
things you were asking about is if you

500
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:47,179
could get some feedback on how people

501
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:48,099
are using it yeah I wonder if in this

502
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:52,360
guide

503
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:57,619
you put a link to a Qualtrics survey

504
00:20:52,359 --> 00:21:00,259
although so then if an educator uses the

505
00:20:57,619 --> 00:21:03,619
material they could fill out how it's

506
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,329
being used I mean it would be optional

507
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:07,399
but I think I think people will be very

508
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:10,309
thankful that you did all this work it

509
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,220
might provide you a little feedback on

510
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:16,639
how they're using it from I don't I

511
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:19,130
think I would ask why not right right I

512
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,170
think we had like assigning in a

513
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,990
visitor's log idea on there but maybe

514
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:26,600
that would be just more instant yeah so

515
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:28,700
that could be your visitors log and also

516
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:32,619
it could be like if you fill out this

517
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:36,019
form you'll be you'll be notified of

518
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:38,419
emerging you know changes in content you

519
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:41,240
know earth maybe other people have ideas

520
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,560
about what would motivate people to just

521
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,690
give you a little bit of information

522
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,179
about how they're using air or have used

523
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,680
it well I have to say the nice thing

524
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,060
about getting a lot of photographs from

525
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,350
people is that they want to see if their

526
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:56,779
photographs got used you another second

527
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:58,339
decision oh yeah no but that's written

528
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:00,170
brings another question how do we get to

529
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:02,299
people to know that the resources are

530
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:04,070
there and that they can use them you

531
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:06,589
know that's the that's the other thing

532
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:08,450
is getting the word out and I don't know

533
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:11,449
what that maybe I put it out on the Hort

534
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:14,299
listserv and say hey come come get it

535
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,160
you know I don't know yeah and the other

536
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,930
question I have is do you have an

537
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,519
evaluation tool

538
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:23,289
oh

539
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:27,220
gosh oh maybe it's coming

540
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:32,500
you what kind of to evaluate yeah I'm

541
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:37,279
for people who are visiting sign oh

542
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:40,599
oh yeah in the garden you mean yeah yes

543
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:43,009
that was one of our hopes to do yeah

544
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:45,079
how do we have you get people to

545
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:46,879
evaluate Sarah maybe you have a better

546
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:49,359
idea when people come to a garden how do

547
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,390
you get feedback from them

548
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:56,119
yeah that's always ongoing struggle I'm

549
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:58,160
actually right now testing that well I

550
00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:00,949
mean essentially the best way to do it

551
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,410
is you know if we you know you eat we

552
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,390
have you look back at what your learning

553
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:07,090
objectives are for each panel and then

554
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,680
you ask questions to evaluate whether

555
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:11,209
what you know ask questions the visitors

556
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,279
to indicate whether those learning

557
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,960
objectives were met or not I mean so one

558
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,509
thing you and I could do John is sit

559
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,160
down and say for each panel say okay you

560
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:20,690
know here are the learning objectives we

561
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,460
felt were important on this panel and

562
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,430
then create some generate some questions

563
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:28,340
that if you know an educator has time to

564
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,630
ask a handful of people you know hey

565
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:32,679
would you mind taking five minutes to

566
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:35,810
answer a few questions that that is um

567
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,060
kind of a standard way to evaluate right

568
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:41,179
or you can have them fill out a little

569
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:44,329
form you know I often feel like it's

570
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,590
often more effective the visitor my more

571
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:47,119
likely to tell you the right the

572
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:48,459
information you're looking for is if if

573
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,409
you just

574
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,789
they spoke it because sometimes people

575
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,860
are like sure I'll write this to fill

576
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:57,950
out the survey and they never do right

577
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:59,829
right well that's that that would be an

578
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,410
educator would have to be there right

579
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:05,349
yeah or a person who's an interview

580
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:08,900
person like a person

581
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:11,539
yeah right I mean I know that like I

582
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,460
worked helped like a children's garden

583
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:14,899
with some interpretive panels and we had

584
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,930
a little QR code in the bottom and said

585
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:21,370
hey tell us you were here and tell us

586
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,370
what you liked about your visit and

587
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,360
that was one way that they're hoping

588
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:27,709
they're going to get feedback the panels

589
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,209
aren't up yet so we don't know if people

590
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,799
have actually done it or not I always

591
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,759
just say if you really want to get the

592
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,200
information you have to do in the

593
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,779
easiest way possible so it's like

594
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,720
dedicate and two hours for an educator

595
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:41,710
to go out there and ask ten people you

596
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:44,298
know it does very well right

597
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:46,220
and it's probably easier to do one a

598
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:48,859
garden day some of you are having garden

599
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,750
days and you've got folks out there and

600
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:53,029
you're doing programs hands-on to have

601
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,950
to have a volunteer assigned to just

602
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:56,450
kind of wandering and asking hey would

603
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:00,440
you mind answering a few questions

604
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,910
yeah awesome okay yeah great no I just

605
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,919
say Volunteers of the bet like that's

606
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,509
what I'm thinking that I'm going to do

607
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,090
for a project that I'm currently working

608
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:11,029
on here and have a volunteer hang out in

609
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:12,500
our welcome center for a few hours each

610
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:14,660
Saturday and ask people about the

611
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,539
exhibits that they're in interacting

612
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:19,460
with right because we do need that

613
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:20,808
feedback we put it out there and we hope

614
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,029
that people are going to come visit it

615
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:24,500
and then and then we see people wander

616
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:26,000
through or we know that they're down

617
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,150
there but we don't really know what they

618
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,179
think and Holly wrote some things in the

619
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:34,220
chat window about getting people to how

620
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:37,850
do we get it out she suggested maybe

621
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,700
you're doing a webinar and and or even

622
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:42,439
just recording a webinar

623
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,058
and it could be you know or even a

624
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,798
recorded PowerPoint that they could use

625
00:25:44,058 --> 00:25:47,899
at regular Master Gardener business

626
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:51,168
meetings to let different associations

627
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,730
know that it's there and that the

628
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:55,370
volunteers might be interested in and

629
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,380
taking it in that next step and getting

630
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:59,389
them printed out and installing them in

631
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,910
their gardens because awesome they're

632
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,230
really yeah

633
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:05,210
the PowerPoint might be good for like

634
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,009
the first garden who puts them out there

635
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,529
to kind of show take pictures a each

636
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:11,808
step meaning like you know here's the

637
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:14,509
here's the material we printed on here's

638
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:18,168
how we installed it can even be like a

639
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:20,480
little YouTube video yeah we're down

640
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:24,110
there you know that like shows the

641
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,058
process yeah which is another great

642
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:30,918
project even that for a volunteer to put

643
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:32,269
together so yeah yeah cuz um maybe I'm

644
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:34,040
saying maybe that sounds too wishy-washy

645
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:36,410
but I'm thinking because I want to use

646
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:39,470
the pollinator paradise sign and put it

647
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,900
in our pollinator garden and so we're

648
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,970
lucky that we have a crew a construction

649
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,950
crew so I can make a request for them to

650
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,630
put it in but if I can say hey can you

651
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,549
tell me when you're going to make the

652
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,960
sign base I can go videotape them doing

653
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:52,579
it and then just kind of splice together

654
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,069
a little fun instructional you know

655
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:56,329
narrative to go along with it right yeah

656
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:59,418
yeah that would be probably till the

657
00:26:56,329 --> 00:27:01,579
spring but yeah yeah I don't know but

658
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:02,750
that's a good idea I think you know it's

659
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:06,740
Anna wish I could be on the wish list

660
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:10,130
for sure oh yeah yeah so we took we took

661
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:12,940
a half an hour I and I hope that that

662
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:15,620
gives people some idea of what

663
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,169
what's out there what we did this is how

664
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:20,569
we're expanding our education our

665
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:22,210
display gardens here in Oneida County

666
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:25,668
and

667
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:29,210
one of the gardener's part of our

668
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:31,460
perennial garden a lot of people around

669
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,919
our area and probably throughout the

670
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:37,130
state are concerned about deer browsing

671
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:39,890
in their perennials so this is a sign

672
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:43,790
that we have in front of this garden

673
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:47,960
that is made up of deer resistant plants

674
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:50,389
and you can see she said visit Cornell

675
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,669
Cooperative Extension website factsheet

676
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:57,500
on the deer resistant plant and

677
00:27:54,669 --> 00:28:00,890
there's the garden in our little plaque

678
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:05,419
would at st. pitchers right there in the

679
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:08,780
center of it and we also wrote a news

680
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:11,210
article for the local newspaper about it

681
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:15,408
too to bring more people out to see the

682
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:17,110
gardens this particular garden in the

683
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:20,600
butterfly house

684
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:22,189
their goal was to provide visitors a

685
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:24,678
place where they can learn about life

686
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:27,019
cycle monarch butterflies the types of

687
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:29,360
milkweed plants needed by caterpillars

688
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:31,240
and nectar producing life needed to

689
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,699
sustain the life of a butterfly

690
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,769
objectives they post a large graphic

691
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,440
display of the life cycle of the monarch

692
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:42,308
butterfly plant two types of milkweed

693
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,779
common and swamp and

694
00:28:42,308 --> 00:28:46,668
explained with signage the importance of

695
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:50,178
preserving milkweed and what type of

696
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:52,759
monarchs use plant and label a variety

697
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:54,830
of nectar producing plants provide a mud

698
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:58,279
puddle for butterflies to use and

699
00:28:54,829 --> 00:29:00,439
display recipe for mixture display fun

700
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:03,379
facts about monarch butterflies and

701
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,048
you'll see that my circle next slides

702
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:08,809
create a brochure that explains how to

703
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:10,389
grow butterfly garden at home in their

704
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:13,579
assessment as

705
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,799
visitors exit the butterfly house ask

706
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:17,720
them to fill out a survey about their

707
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:20,500
experience and knowledge gained and

708
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,679
you'll see our survey box and

709
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:27,859
I'll go into that and

710
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:30,640
we did have the spine soldier bug attack

711
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:34,029
our larvae of our

712
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,870
monarch caterpillars this

713
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:41,450
year and that kind of devastation to our

714
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:44,479
monarch display this year but here's the

715
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:46,900
signs they created that go throughout

716
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,900
the house

717
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:56,380
and then that's lifecycle display and

718
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:57,960
they're looking for a big laminated

719
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,870
poster from

720
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:04,360
educational site that would have the

721
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:07,359
monarch lifecycle little better these

722
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:11,699
were pictures that we took on one Milla

723
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:16,319
gardeners made over the years ago and

724
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,319
there's some butterfly Mud Pie

725
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:24,059
the recipe

726
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:26,609
right there and then take a survey this

727
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:29,279
is as they exit the butterfly house and

728
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:32,309
then we have the information box there

729
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:35,420
that we had brochures in about making a

730
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:39,480
butterfly garden and

731
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:42,900
like what plants the butterflies like

732
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,130
and then the surveys are in the info box

733
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,919
and they just leave them right there

734
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:49,169
with the pencils

735
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:52,169
and here's another sign right there

736
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:55,019
caterpillar systems for Chinese eyes to

737
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:58,470
Nancy and this was our we educated

738
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:00,509
public because many were coming to see

739
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,879
the butterflies and what happened to him

740
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:07,608
and we had those right on our door

741
00:31:02,878 --> 00:31:12,388
posted an explanation of what happened

742
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:16,470
and when some kids came I was out there

743
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:19,229
talking to him and they seemed like the

744
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:21,499
explanation they learned more something

745
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:23,599
that there's predators to the

746
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:27,528
butterflies

747
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,528
and that was what they

748
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,789
we also had some other culprits in there

749
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:38,509
too Munson

750
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:38,509
so nice too

751
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:46,469
and our pollination garden and I like

752
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:50,639
how you did the signage for pollination

753
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:53,210
paradise this is well tying nicely for

754
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,580
the area and our Gardens next year

755
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:57,769
all-american selections we participate

756
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:01,589
in

757
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:05,069
that organization every year we sign up

758
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:08,579
to receive seeds which a local high

759
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:10,519
school FFA group starts the seeds for us

760
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:14,638
and

761
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:17,750
their annuals and also vegetable seeds

762
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:21,329
but this year their theme was pollinator

763
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:26,519
education and we participated in their

764
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:28,519
landscape design contest and this is how

765
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:32,250
we incorporate the

766
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:35,298
pollinator education into this annual

767
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:39,148
brick garden here and

768
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:41,548
we had a submit that we have the plants

769
00:32:39,148 --> 00:32:44,089
all labels and they do provide some

770
00:32:41,548 --> 00:32:48,000
labels for their plants and

771
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:50,038
we had a gentleman who has a friend of

772
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,028
one of the gardeners who made up some

773
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:56,490
recyclable water sources that the

774
00:32:54,028 --> 00:32:59,250
pollinators could use that were creative

775
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:03,230
mold sponges in there to soak up a

776
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:05,750
nectar solution that they made and

777
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:09,048
one of the gardener's

778
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:11,940
grandsons was a member of a

779
00:33:09,048 --> 00:33:14,908
Cub Scout or Boy Scout group and he made

780
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:17,548
a mason bee house and that was all put

781
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:21,059
in the garden and labeled there for

782
00:33:17,548 --> 00:33:22,250
people to see and there's another shot

783
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:24,798
of the

784
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:28,460
nectar and

785
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:32,398
what is pollination

786
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:35,759
sign there and then the overall we end

787
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:39,768
up creating a mobile and then we have

788
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:43,259
beetles butterflies hummingbirds and

789
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:46,460
birds on there and it tells a little

790
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:50,829
more about the different pollinators and

791
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,660
it kind of moves around with the wind

792
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:53,980
and

793
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,080
all-american selections like how we

794
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,700
worked with the different community

795
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:01,379
groups

796
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:05,410
we involve 4-h ER and

797
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:08,320
AARC schoolwork kids help in the gardens

798
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:10,869
too and we received honorable mention

799
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,700
this year for what they did with the

800
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:18,489
education and that's kind of how we this

801
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:21,119
year have added a little more education

802
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,119
to our garden

803
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:30,538
and thank you Sarah for getting us

804
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:34,450
rolling Oh

805
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:36,819
Holly this is Jen that is really cool

806
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:39,219
that you worked movement into there

807
00:34:36,818 --> 00:34:41,949
that's really awesome that that moves

808
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:43,888
people see things that move and it

809
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,750
tracks them you know

810
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:49,210
but I saw that a Fiona had a question

811
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:51,278
earlier and I think this is probably

812
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:54,068
something we all would benefit from

813
00:34:51,278 --> 00:34:57,190
knowing is when you create interpretive

814
00:34:54,068 --> 00:34:59,079
signage how many like how would you know

815
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:01,269
what's enough how many words should be

816
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:02,950
on a sign or are there any other

817
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:04,719
pointers I don't know if we saw that in

818
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:07,538
the chat window I don't know Sarah if

819
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:10,108
you have any rules of thumb that you

820
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:10,109
could share

821
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,690
webex undo itself or a fun presentation

822
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,279
I mean the quick and dirty I mean

823
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,240
there's a lot I could say and I

824
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,130
certainly don't want to take up

825
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,869
everyone's time but they're definitely

826
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,180
like there's definitely interpretive

827
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:30,029
research about like how many chunks of

828
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:32,559
words should be together

829
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:36,130
before people start getting tired of

830
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:37,630
reading it so I never exceed 75 words I

831
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:41,849
try and I try to even do a lot less if

832
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:44,800
possible in one chunk of words and

833
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:48,880
some people recommend you know don't

834
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,880
exceed 150 words per sign now I try not

835
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,890
to do that too much but I also feel like

836
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,039
the key thing about interpretive signs

837
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:59,109
that I feel is most effective is giving

838
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,659
a title that gives you the understand

839
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:04,000
idea of the whole sign an introductory

840
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:06,129
paragraph underneath that that again

841
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,610
summarizes what the sign talks about and

842
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:12,190
then the chunks of text that are kind of

843
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:14,650
secondary to that reinforce that main

844
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:16,329
idea with clear headings that tell you

845
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:18,340
what you're going to talk about so that

846
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:19,779
way people there's a hierarchy people

847
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,820
could walk by a sign they could read the

848
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,170
title may be the introductory paragraph

849
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,360
and they're going to get the main idea

850
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,400
you want to put forth and everything

851
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,190
else reinforces and gives even more

852
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,440
detail to that main idea to me that's

853
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,179
the key way to structure an interpretive

854
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,200
sign

855
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:39,190
and again try I

856
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:42,609
assume people aren't going to read

857
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:44,679
everything but I always assume that so I

858
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:46,240
assume that like there's like have you

859
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:48,460
guys ever heard of like the three-second

860
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:51,129
three minute and or 30-second

861
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,840
three-minute rule the people that most

862
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,789
people are going to look at a sign for

863
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,720
three seconds so in those three seconds

864
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:57,670
you're going to get them to read the

865
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:59,980
title and maybe the other headings the

866
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:02,500
thirty second people might read the

867
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,780
heading the main title the introductory

868
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,210
paragraph and the main headings to the

869
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:10,450
other places and then the three-minute

870
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:13,869
people will if you you know really stick

871
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:16,210
to you know 150 to 200 words might read

872
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:17,159
the whole thing but I give people the

873
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:21,070
opportunity

874
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:23,710
to dig deeper and the headings I feel

875
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:25,600
are the invitations to dig deeper like I

876
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,010
honestly when I go to a

877
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,929
Museum and I see like a whole long

878
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,970
paragraph I'm like those people didn't

879
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:32,769
want me to read it it's like they didn't

880
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:35,319
invite me to read it so I just I don't

881
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:36,519
I'm not a reader so I'm a good person a

882
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,920
great interpretive side because I don't

883
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:40,449
even like to read I

884
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,829
mean I like to read books but like if

885
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:43,689
I'm enjoying a garden I don't want to

886
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:46,299
have to read a ton of information right

887
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:49,720
you're moving yeah yeah yeah very

888
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:52,180
helpful yeah and so I mean I'd be happy

889
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:53,349
to do like a like actually prepare kind

890
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:56,199
of a presentation on what I've learned

891
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:58,960
in the interpretive realm over that you

892
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:01,359
know the course of my career with just

893
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,909
like the kind of tips and basics if you

894
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,470
guys are interested in that but but to

895
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:07,359
me it's like the key is inviting people

896
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:10,989
to want to read more if you don't make

897
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,430
the effort to try to rope them in by you

898
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:14,679
know headings that tell you what they're

899
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:16,149
going to read about no one wants to read

900
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:20,369
and then process what they just read

901
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:23,260
they want you to tell them write a

902
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:25,569
youtube video yeah it's like five

903
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,550
minutes or ten minutes yeah just like to

904
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:29,800
give a few examples and I feel like the

905
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:32,620
pollinator ones you know that you know

906
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:36,970
we graduate we haven't evaluated them

907
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:38,799
with people but we could I could use

908
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:41,609
that as a way to like you know what the

909
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,110
what drew me to design it in that way

910
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:46,150
yeah and then the other thing which I

911
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:48,579
think you did with Holly and her group

912
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:52,119
that was so critical is even before you

913
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:55,900
get to the signage mm-hmm you go through

914
00:38:52,119 --> 00:39:00,039
that process of what are the messages or

915
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:01,389
the main goal of this space somebody

916
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:03,880
works through that process of

917
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:06,879
identifying their their main themes and

918
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:09,340
their what Holly was describing you you

919
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,230
took her group through is probably

920
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,750
critical to getting to that point of

921
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:15,610
where okay now I can decide what my

922
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,469
title is going to be because I know what

923
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:18,460
I want

924
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:19,959
yeah exactly

925
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,090
yeah it's like I'm creating what the

926
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,980
main theme is for the like for instance

927
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,600
the pollinator paradise our main theme

928
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:28,119
was here's the way you can create a

929
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:31,029
pollinator paradise in your in your

930
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:34,889
garden and you know Jen was really good

931
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:37,210
about creating catchy fun titles

932
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:39,279
now Holly I just wanted to know what the

933
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:42,519
mobile was made out of his at metal

934
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,890
it's a PVC pipe Oh

935
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:47,650
nice that's awesome when was it made by

936
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:51,519
the group that it was at the 4-h group

937
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:54,280
well I had one for ager and two Master

938
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:57,599
Gardener volunteers kind of helped to

939
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:02,530
guide her on it and

940
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:06,489
so and then we've laminated and used

941
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:09,310
rings we had like pull ties before but

942
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:12,189
now we have like the three binder ring

943
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:14,279
type things hooking to the sign and we

944
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,960
had to use them

945
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,180
duct tape to kind of reinforce it

946
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,750
because this fall the winds have gotten

947
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:25,929
stronger up here and that was kind of

948
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:28,269
tearing it before year one but I mean it

949
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:31,710
was fun to make and it's nice and light

950
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:35,500
and we can use it for other things to

951
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:38,500
cool and congratulations Holly that's

952
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,780
really an awesome thing to get

953
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,190
recognized you know and sometimes we

954
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,840
don't do a great job of Tooting our own

955
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:49,300
horn but you know that's really awesome

956
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:52,200
the gardener's yep they they do a lot

957
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:56,400
hard work and I'm glad they

958
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:58,409
participated in the contest huh

959
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,329
thank you

960
00:40:58,409 --> 00:41:03,039
anything anything else is great very

961
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:05,039
informal actually I feel like we should

962
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:08,050
have like a workshop

963
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,639
on a regular basis for people to share

964
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,650
what they're trying and how they're

965
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:13,420
trying it and as you because as you said

966
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:17,139
Jen it was better to do it as a

967
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,789
collective yeah and then to try to do do

968
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:22,119
this sort of thing on our own because we

969
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:24,759
all have our own you know you just only

970
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:26,529
see one way right and so you get all

971
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,600
these comments and you always filter

972
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:30,340
them through your lens you know your

973
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:32,440
lens of what you need and where you are

974
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,900
working and that kind of thing but they

975
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,460
open the door to like aha you know maybe

976
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,200
we should try that or you get these

977
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,909
great ideas like we might steal from

978
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:43,509
Holly now of having something that moves

979
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:46,629
in the garden like that you know so yeah

980
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:48,670
so so it'd be fun that maybe maybe maybe

981
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:52,490
this is where Cornell plantations has a

982
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:54,099
role we come Cornell plantations for a

983
00:41:52,489 --> 00:41:58,129
summer workshop

984
00:41:54,099 --> 00:42:02,029
would be fine a son thank you are of

985
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:03,920
different signs and yes and other types

986
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:08,660
of interpretation besides signs like

987
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:11,240
creative ways you know - I mean signs

988
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:13,159
are great there they can be low-cost and

989
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:15,109
you know they're always there you can't

990
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:17,690
have people there all the time right

991
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:22,190
but there's we've been trying to add

992
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:24,880
mobile tools to give people guided tours

993
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:28,730
of our gardens and

994
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,170
yeah yeah I like like other people

995
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:32,690
sharing like Holly did and just like

996
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,250
Jenna and I did you know like hearing

997
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,260
the other creative ideas people have

998
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:39,409
been doing - so people can like build on

999
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:40,940
each other I'm sorry I just wanted to

1000
00:42:39,409 --> 00:42:42,409
mention really quickly because Jen had

1001
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:46,130
mentioned how difficult it can be to

1002
00:42:42,409 --> 00:42:48,679
find images and the New York State IPM

1003
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:52,280
program has a Flickr site and we have

1004
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:55,519
albums specific to pollinators and also

1005
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:58,510
bees and a wasp but I was looking at the

1006
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:02,809
bee poster I noticed that you had a

1007
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:05,480
photo captioned about how the the wasp

1008
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:08,869
will collect wood fibers to build their

1009
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:11,869
nests and it reminded me of a photo but

1010
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:13,849
I was luckily able to collect showing a

1011
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:16,369
paper wasps actually scraping the wood

1012
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:18,699
off so it's good to know that those

1013
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:20,259
kinds of things are available

1014
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:23,629
and

1015
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:25,250
Joe joylynn that was a great sharing and

1016
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:27,680
actually somebody suggested that we

1017
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:30,050
shared that we borrow some photos from

1018
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:32,269
there which we did and and credited the

1019
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:35,870
photographer's but did you do you all

1020
00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:37,940
have access access to that Flickr site

1021
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:40,639
or anybody with a Flickr account can see

1022
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:43,970
it right any I don't even think you have

1023
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:47,029
to have an account to see it no you just

1024
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:49,669
need to go to Flickr and our garden

1025
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:53,570
based learning also has a Flickr site as

1026
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:55,700
well it's not it well no it's not

1027
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,890
available right now because we are I

1028
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:59,329
think sarah has a few more changes to

1029
00:43:57,889 --> 00:44:01,849
tweak and now we're going to add climate

1030
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:06,569
change if we can into that line um and

1031
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:09,630
then that that will all go on to the CCE

1032
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:11,820
resource educators resource sharing site

1033
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:13,349
and at that point if you would like I

1034
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,410
will just add you if you're not already

1035
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:20,089
added but

1036
00:44:15,409 --> 00:44:23,429
we used to have slides actual slides

1037
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:26,420
with a script so you would get rocks in

1038
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:28,879
the mail yeah this is this is more of a

1039
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:33,380
sandbox location

1040
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:36,530
and and so what we're trying to

1041
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:39,150
trying to get a little more

1042
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:40,340
skill that sharing stuff that we're

1043
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:42,750
developing

1044
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:44,990
so people aren't developing the same

1045
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:48,289
thing in

1046
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:48,289
separate world

1047
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,000
right although sometimes since we're do

1048
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,200
we are

1049
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,690
what I'm trying to say we're developing

1050
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,849
them simultaneously that sometimes we

1051
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:01,889
end up with this overlap naturally and

1052
00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:05,099
it was just because I put that query out

1053
00:45:01,889 --> 00:45:07,379
to the whole group on the listserv that

1054
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:10,139
I think somebody from New York State IPM

1055
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,240
said hey we have this whole file sharing

1056
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:14,460
site on Flickr and I was like a

1057
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,500
wonderland you know somebody opened up

1058
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,940
the door to Oz in the back it was all

1059
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,369
these wonderful photographs that I just

1060
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,440
didn't know existed so it's just

1061
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:24,840
throwing it out there and having that

1062
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,670
that casual kind of conversation that we

1063
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,220
have online that helps make those

1064
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:31,260
connections I think

1065
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:33,319
great well thank you yes thank you

1066
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:37,050
