1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:13,250
so yeah I'm gonna I'm really excited to

4
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:14,509
talk to you about a little of the

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,030
research that I've been doing the last

6
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,460
four years and a half here and

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,970
everything will go around this idea of

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:26,449
using functional genomics to help

9
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:30,140
dynamic prediction dynamic selection

10
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:33,079
models in Kassala okay and back in 2013

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:36,049
I was about to get interview by John

12
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,539
Luke through Skype and I had no idea

13
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:41,479
what dynamic selection was so I started

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:43,429
looking at the literature and what I'm

15
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45,859
pretty sure happened with most of you

16
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:48,649
trying to approach genomic selection

17
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:53,269
we're haunted by this scheme that I

18
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:55,689
don't even need to explain this however

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,309
at the time didn't help me to understand

20
00:00:55,689 --> 00:01:02,899
these models were working so I came with

21
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:05,390
a scheme out of my own briefly you have

22
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:07,969
phenotypes and genotypes of a training

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,129
population and combining these two

24
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:12,679
elements you will build a prediction

25
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:15,500
model but here I'm depicting it as a

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,189
wormhole because I didn't have any idea

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,310
what was happening here so what I did

28
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:24,769
know was that the DNA of a none

29
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,710
phenotype Kesava was traveling through

30
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:31,039
space and time to give us genomic

31
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:32,809
expected breeding values that is

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,570
basically your expectation or your

33
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:39,399
prediction on how that unfiltered

34
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:42,228
cassava is gonna perform on the future

35
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,689
okay so what I did understand at the at

36
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:47,859
the moment was that my mission within

37
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:50,898
the project was to use functional

38
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:53,030
genomics as a proxy to understand the

39
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:57,109
biology behind the phenotype that we're

40
00:01:53,030 --> 00:02:00,290
trying to predict and see where and you

41
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:03,500
know try to test whether the inclusion

42
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:08,050
of this extra element in the prediction

43
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:11,750
model will be a positive one okay so

44
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:14,930
today I have three topics for you we'll

45
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,789
go through all of them but yes important

46
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,360
things that all of them will go around

47
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:24,750
this idea of this

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:31,860
in biology dynamic prediction models so

49
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:33,930
again but button on 2013 IIE is you know

50
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,480
I was neon cassava and I went to the

51
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,310
databases trying to find genomic

52
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,099
information and casaya was a really

53
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,259
orphan group they're wearing a lot of

54
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:45,030
genomic resources or genomic research

55
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,969
than other time i was really interested

56
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,990
in working with biotic stresses so I

57
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:52,020
went to a database

58
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,600
checking for resistant genes in cassava

59
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,570
and I couldn't find it so with Martha

60
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:01,650
the time we throw it as an opportunity

61
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:03,810
to both get these that is that mine and

62
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,739
contribute a little bit to the growing

63
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,560
genomic libraries of cassava so we

64
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,719
identify this family of game the NBA

65
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,199
star family that is known to be the

66
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,819
biggest resistant in family in plants we

67
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,549
did some phylogenetics and most

68
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:24,719
importantly we mapped them into their

69
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:27,510
position of the in chromosome and this

70
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,549
data later helped other scientists to

71
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:32,179
make sense out of their game was results

72
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:36,180
for example this is a publication by

73
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:41,150
Ismail Kondo a collaborator he found a

74
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:44,129
couple of of QTL or brown string disease

75
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,989
one of them being in chromosome 11 and

76
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:48,569
you have to believe me here what it used

77
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,969
to mean he on day on the pick it

78
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,519
collocates nicely with a small cluster

79
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:57,780
of NBA cell erogenous and some

80
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,780
collaborators from Kenya now are

81
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,469
evaluating using knockouts with pre

82
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,169
spare and complementation assays - you

83
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:10,609
know validate these candidate genes as

84
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:13,399
they resist so yeah that's

85
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:16,459
nice and again that was polished in 2015

86
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,858
but the years passed and Kisame stopped

87
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,108
being an orphan crop suddenly in the

88
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:25,279
span of two or three years there were

89
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:28,159
lots of research going on we have a nice

90
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:31,009
haplotype mild thanks to remove and the

91
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,850
batter lab plenty of transcriptomics

92
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:37,639
studies a better genome with a really

93
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,120
nice rnaseq guided a notation we have

94
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:45,079
even methylation data and a plethora of

95
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:47,418
tools so from now on we switch a little

96
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:50,750
bit from doing the you know the genomic

97
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:53,689
resources generator to be more like data

98
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,350
scavengers and try to use all these to

99
00:04:53,689 --> 00:05:00,560
put them in the indigent prediction

100
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:02,419
frameworks okay let's make a stop here

101
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,709
and I'm going to talk a little bit about

102
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:09,740
which models we'll be using in the rest

103
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:13,189
of my talk spoiler alert we won't be

104
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,610
used in any fancy Bayesian or machine

105
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:19,819
learning algorithms we what we will be

106
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:23,930
using is just different modifications of

107
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:25,399
the good old model okay for those that

108
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,769
don't know what you like model is

109
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:32,149
basically a mixed model feed on the

110
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:34,668
basis of individuals rather than but

111
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:36,639
using a covariance matrix that is

112
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,819
calculated as the genomic relationship

113
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,189
okay

114
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:44,329
and this incorporate is genetic random

115
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:47,120
effects you basically calculate the year

116
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:50,750
I am using all the markers available in

117
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:55,759
2014 however this group from a surprise

118
00:05:50,750 --> 00:06:00,500
and safe and company we're interested in

119
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:03,439
studying how splitting or partitioning

120
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,228
the genomic regions into functional

121
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,509
elements let's say Colin radios UTA

122
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:12,860
radians from other videos would

123
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:15,349
influence this model and as you know

124
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,720
develop models and any model that will

125
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,300
with most of the models that will work

126
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,310
with with engineered predictions where

127
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,699
we have lots of predictors and a few

128
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,339
individuals have

129
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,009
we'll find a way how to deal with

130
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:32,029
collinearity and overfeeding so GTL

131
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:35,039
abuse shrinkage we're all most of the

132
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:38,879
snip effects will are random and our

133
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,220
Shrunk it towards zero and this

134
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,589
shrinkage severity will be a function of

135
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,410
the numbers of his needs in the model

136
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:48,619
the idea of these guys was what if we

137
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,570
partition the genome in different random

138
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:54,300
effects genetic random effects and I'm

139
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:57,540
from now I'm just gonna call these guys

140
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:01,650
as Colonel and if one of these kernels

141
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:05,280
is enriched for coastal variance due to

142
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:07,169
biological priors I have this might

143
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,949
result in an increase in prediction

144
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:12,780
occurs why because if you are relaxing

145
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:16,110
the shrinkage severity you are allowing

146
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:20,939
more markers into that partition having

147
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:22,620
a vigorous okay so this is basically the

148
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,089
rationale that I'm gonna use on the

149
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,149
models playing throughout my

150
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:29,689
presentation

151
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:32,569
the second nice thing well useful thing

152
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:35,449
about this research was that a goose a

153
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:37,969
fan collaborators determined that we

154
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:41,080
need to have level sequence imputation

155
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:44,600
when you are using dynamic partitioning

156
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:46,909
methodologies basically the estimation

157
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,639
of is a percentage of any hurt abilities

158
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:55,550
will be really bad if you just use

159
00:07:49,639 --> 00:08:00,949
genotype is in comparison when you use

160
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:03,259
genotype holding on imputation mark okay

161
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:05,750
so yeah this is a little of the

162
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:10,250
background that we will be going on so

163
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:12,709
just keep this in mind now the second

164
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:16,699
topic that I want to talk about is the

165
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:19,698
the the actually a case study how my

166
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:22,009
first approach to use biology to improve

167
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,960
genomic prediction as I told you it was

168
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:26,899
really interested in working with a

169
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:30,888
diseases abiotic stresses so casts

170
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:33,379
around a strict disease was really

171
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:35,538
attractive to me so in this study I

172
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:40,278
tried to use whole genome imputation and

173
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:44,230
a transcriptomics study show you to

174
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:48,080
increase the performance of this model

175
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:49,879
just briefly cassava brown string

176
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,690
disease goes like a sovereign's trick

177
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:56,149
virus and it's a really awful disease

178
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:59,720
okay symptoms in leaves you have

179
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:01,639
chlorosis on the secondary veins but the

180
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,910
most important thing is that you have

181
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:08,179
root rot on the tuber that make them

182
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:11,559
inedible even for animal feed and they

183
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:16,819
are transmitted by white flies in

184
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:19,039
persistent way okay so that's that's our

185
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,379
model now so let's go back to my

186
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,899
previous scheme and I'll show you how

187
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:27,769
I'm gonna incorporate the different

188
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:29,929
elements into this case so for example

189
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:33,799
the phenotypes evaluated now will be

190
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:35,750
cvsd related traits measure on leaves

191
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:37,769
and roots three months six months and

192
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,409
one year after planting

193
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:45,169
genotypes will be GBS marcus's will be

194
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:49,069
imputed given sequence the wormhole

195
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:52,860
prediction model will be a multi-car and

196
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:55,920
the the genomics data will be

197
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:59,519
transcriptomics studies util information

198
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,259
and related traits okay so now let's

199
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,819
plane a little bit of each of these

200
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:07,950
components in the phenotypes we use

201
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:13,110
we're basically on leaves and roots a

202
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:16,250
categorical in rows from 1 to 5 our high

203
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:21,240
throughput phenotype in scheme

204
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:24,299
Alfred is here ah da da da the

205
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,060
phenotypes okay the genotypes we

206
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:30,809
recognized with this was safe paper the

207
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:35,759
necessity of going from 40,000 markers

208
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:38,129
that we were obtaining a with DVS to

209
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,319
millions of markers through whole genome

210
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:42,710
imputation and how was this possible

211
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,110
it's not a lot that we are inventing

212
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:50,310
markers that were in type we use this

213
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:52,379
scheme of all denomination that uses the

214
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:57,929
Hofmann that was produced by the buckler

215
00:10:52,379 --> 00:11:03,210
lab 241 individuals including cultivated

216
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:06,779
cassava while hybrids and while cassava

217
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:10,080
relatives and those were deep sequence

218
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:13,860
238 so we have a nice haplotype maps of

219
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,530
those 204 individuals and while we are

220
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:20,009
performing here is that when we have GBS

221
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:21,659
we have a bunch of markers but we also

222
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:24,750
have a lots of interrelation those of

223
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:27,120
sites that were missing and what the

224
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:30,480
whole genome imputation algorithm does

225
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,899
is try to infer which of these regions

226
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,930
we a belongs to which of these

227
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:38,370
haplotypes and gate most importantly

228
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:41,429
they the boundaries

229
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,950
once it has the most probable haplotype

230
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:46,559
of each region it will just until the

231
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:49,230
missing genotypes with the ones present

232
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,888
in the hub and that's how you go from

233
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,678
CVS or

234
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:59,139
markers to millions of markers using

235
00:11:53,678 --> 00:12:01,028
this hubbub information and now you will

236
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:04,778
tell me your word you don't need

237
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:07,328
millions of marker to perform a genomic

238
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:10,088
selection we all know that the problem

239
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:12,099
was that him in my approach I was

240
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:13,689
interested in Italian different videos

241
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,989
in the genome that might be important

242
00:12:13,688 --> 00:12:20,289
and then if I use only the 42 K markers

243
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:26,489
from DVS I could only touch around 30%

244
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:30,818
of it then if I did be real imputation

245
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:34,629
imputation I get to 70% and finally I

246
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:36,278
stopped with impute - that is for me at

247
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:38,589
least a verified you know impute a

248
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:41,980
l'heure and I could get markers that

249
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:43,749
will be tying close to 92% of it so

250
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:49,269
that's the only reason why I keep this

251
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:52,589
this this methodology together with

252
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:56,558
those information from the elusive paper

253
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:59,709
so yeah now we have phenotypes we have

254
00:12:56,558 --> 00:13:03,610
genotypes we need a population for this

255
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:05,768
our population this is a graph of the 18

256
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,808
chromosomes and including the eldest or

257
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:10,028
the mean LD score you don't know what I

258
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:12,969
mean LD score is just do graph each

259
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:15,850
marker and then calculate the R square

260
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,309
of that marker with all the markers in a

261
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,918
beam of one mega base and then you

262
00:13:18,308 --> 00:13:24,368
divide that by the number of markers in

263
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:27,220
that beam and you plot all of them and

264
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:30,610
it gives you a sense of local LD

265
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:34,839
patterns you can see here a cassava has

266
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:40,058
like a funky pattern of hi LD close to

267
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:42,699
the telomeres but there is a second here

268
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:44,139
I'm plotting this a classical indicate

269
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,208
the only thing that I'm doing

270
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:49,269
differently here is that I'm coloring

271
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:52,298
chromosome 1 and chromosome 4 in a

272
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:55,149
yellow and red respectively because they

273
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:57,308
have fun recent integration that doesn't

274
00:13:55,149 --> 00:14:00,818
have a lot of recombination so that's

275
00:13:57,308 --> 00:14:01,879
why what is dragging this this funky LD

276
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:07,129
putter

277
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:11,149
hi our squares even when the markers are

278
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:14,088
position really far away in the group

279
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:17,209
okay so we have markers with the

280
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:21,190
phenotypes we have a population and this

281
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:23,900
is our bio biological data okay this a

282
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:27,830
transcriptomics a study was performed by

283
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:29,778
Teddy amuse and polish in 2017 and she

284
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:33,139
basically grabbed two contrasting

285
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:37,639
genotypes Nami conga resistance to Susie

286
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:42,379
and Albert's really susceptible and she

287
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:44,980
grafted these varieties with infected

288
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:47,419
science and non-infected science and

289
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:50,930
evaluated differentially gene expressed

290
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:53,449
across seven different angles six hours

291
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:58,809
after grafting 24 hours after grafting

292
00:14:53,450 --> 00:15:01,550
48 hours and so on until 54 days and

293
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:04,759
what we observe here is that the

294
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:06,649
resistant plant in yellow has a lot of

295
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:09,799
differential expression she's really

296
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:14,028
aware that it's been infected while they

297
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:16,819
Albert's plan insusceptible has like a

298
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:19,759
really mild response at 6 hours and then

299
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,820
nothing non difference between the the

300
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,528
transcriptional pattern between the

301
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,690
control and the infected ones in all

302
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:30,110
these time points it just start reacting

303
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:32,480
when it's it's basically too late so

304
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,129
then we we start thinking how can we use

305
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,190
distress photonic data

306
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:40,220
wait the genomic prediction models and

307
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:45,950
we had several hypotheses the first

308
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:48,230
hypothesis was just brute force so yeah

309
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,600
let's just use all the differential

310
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,240
expressions and compare the accuracy

311
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,430
that we have through the whole genome

312
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,889
imputation this is the full model I will

313
00:15:55,429 --> 00:16:00,679
always be comparing the accuracies with

314
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:03,769
the full model at the last column this

315
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:06,049
is cvsd measure on leaves six months

316
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:08,028
after planting and this is measuring

317
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:11,000
roots and the model that we are running

318
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:12,830
here is a to colonel model one of the

319
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,200
colonel will cover all these needs that

320
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:18,680
are differentially expressed genes and

321
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:23,430
the other a colonel will have the rest

322
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:28,259
of the everything so as n

323
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:31,199
force approach usually happens it didn't

324
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:33,960
have a good result the prediction

325
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,230
accuracies were basically similar as

326
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,500
they the ones when you will just use the

327
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,730
whole genome imputation full data set

328
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,240
then we generally we try to be a little

329
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:48,570
bit smarter about it and we had this

330
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,610
idea that maybe those genes that have a

331
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:53,339
positive interaction between genotype

332
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:56,940
and inoculation status inoculation

333
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:59,720
status beam if the plan was control or

334
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:03,540
inoculated could have a better effect a

335
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,670
major effect on day on day on the

336
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,949
resistance phenomena so we fit this

337
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,019
model where expression the gene

338
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:12,480
expression of each genes will be

339
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:15,389
explained by rapes plus a three-way

340
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,650
interaction of genotype inoculation

341
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:20,110
status and time

342
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:23,019
and we extracted those genes Loreen here

343
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:27,459
that had an positively significant

344
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:32,410
interaction between G by I okay

345
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:34,690
um similar to the last a picture we

346
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:38,200
calculated yet Nam ik accuracy the

347
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:43,180
prediction accuracies for this model in

348
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:45,960
rate we have they a three colonel model

349
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,799
that was filled with these G by I games

350
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,380
partitioning two chromosome 11

351
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,720
chromosome four and the rest of the you

352
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,520
know here we also incorporated the fact

353
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,960
that we know that in chromosome 11 and

354
00:17:54,519 --> 00:18:02,500
or there were big big to deal okay and

355
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:06,940
we also fit a model with random a random

356
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:09,940
genes in the same a proportion and what

357
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,789
we saw is that our model is doing better

358
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,580
than random for separating leaves and

359
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:18,159
roots but we are know still not doing

360
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:21,399
better than when test using the basic

361
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,300
development so yeah now the second

362
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,940
hypothesis didn't quite will work yet so

363
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:30,639
then we have a third hypothesis but if

364
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:34,090
state of using the differential express

365
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,540
genes we just use a clustering method

366
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:41,049
whole genome now we're 18 co-expression

367
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:43,779
network analysis to try to mine

368
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:47,619
important games unless focusing in this

369
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:51,509
part of the of the slide the colors are

370
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:52,979
a little off but it's fine too

371
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:54,660
better idea of what weighted yuko

372
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,450
expression middle or analysis is doing

373
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,750
it yes it's just clustering genes that

374
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:04,620
have a similar expression pattern and if

375
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:06,539
you go today to the black model here and

376
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:10,439
you'll have to believe me because the

377
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:13,379
colors are off this black module has

378
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,170
genes that are expressed only in the

379
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:19,470
enemy conga genotype and then we have

380
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:21,390
another tsiyon module that are mostly

381
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:26,190
expressed in Alberts

382
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:29,690
okay this should be way rather more read

383
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:34,230
the colors are a little off but anyway

384
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:37,289
we get a bunch of modules with this

385
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,370
technique and again we try our technique

386
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:40,440
of two turns

387
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:42,779
let's get the genes that are within our

388
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,180
module and everything else in the genome

389
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:50,849
and compare them with the last column

390
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:53,279
that will be they not very good results

391
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:55,949
the only one that was doing better than

392
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:59,490
the whole a model was this model rates

393
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:01,650
and only for three months so no really

394
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,660
good results of it at the time so we

395
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:07,210
come up with a four hypothesis that was

396
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,710
basically desperation and

397
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:12,190
mix different sources of information

398
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:15,460
trying to beat the performance we hold

399
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,980
in our imputation and we did it but with

400
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,940
you know from ranging from one point six

401
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:24,429
seven to two point five percent overall

402
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:27,880
prediction accuracy so it wasn't a big

403
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:31,179
game but it was a little game and we

404
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,350
have several options why this approach

405
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:38,200
didn't work as as we were expecting

406
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:40,599
there is a thing of the trade a genetic

407
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,399
architecture these cvsd resistant in

408
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:44,648
these populations have big qtls

409
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:49,178
and may be trying to mine information

410
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:53,288
out of the RNA seek data is not really

411
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:55,809
viable because of those two bqp else our

412
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:59,048
imputation accuracy was performing a

413
00:20:55,808 --> 00:21:01,710
half map that only 140 individuals there

414
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:04,990
is issues with a phenotype in platform

415
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:07,120
they transcriptomics experiment it was

416
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,710
only performing two varieties that might

417
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:12,058
not be representative of the population

418
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:15,278
and we're working him and finally they

419
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:17,859
the transcriptomic experiment was used

420
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:20,740
it was infected using only one strain of

421
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:23,019
the virus not with the two and what

422
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,269
usually happens in feeling reality that

423
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:27,639
there is a co-infection of Ugandan

424
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:30,058
cassava and streak virus and cassava

425
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:37,350
Brown Street

426
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:37,349
ok ok ok

427
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,808
hmm what was sorry

428
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:54,100
yeah one of the things that was also

429
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:57,609
disturbing me until that point was that

430
00:21:54,099 --> 00:22:00,129
we were only looking for important genes

431
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:03,279
all important regions within the genes

432
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:07,210
and the gene gimmick region is only a

433
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:09,009
tiny part of the whole genome for the

434
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:13,048
hotel genome there are functional

435
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:15,730
elements happen outside of the genes and

436
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:20,589
yeah the motivation for doing this third

437
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:23,919
part of this is work it was this article

438
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:26,529
during a raid on 2014 by Manolis Kellis

439
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,559
from the encode project there was a lot

440
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:34,149
of troubles because the guys from the

441
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:37,029
ink could say 80% of the human genome is

442
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,980
transcribed so 80% of the human genome

443
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:42,668
is functional no and then there were

444
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,319
lots of the evolutionary you cannot say

445
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:47,890
that because you are not under the light

446
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:50,859
of evolution that can be true I mean the

447
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:53,410
the guys from encode found evidence for

448
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:56,229
80% of the Y in the human you know it

449
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:58,210
was transcribed but we also have to

450
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:01,179
consider all the Arabians we have

451
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,819
genetic evidence that is basically that

452
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:06,429
that generate phenotype what you find

453
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:09,029
when you run a new was and you have also

454
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:11,048
evolutionary evidence meaning that

455
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:13,240
regions in the genome that are

456
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:17,019
constrained by evolution are more

457
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,089
probable probable functional so yeah in

458
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:22,029
in the like so is this I was also

459
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:25,109
interested in trying to find functional

460
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:28,869
elements outside of the cassava genome

461
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:31,029
so that brings up to this expanding the

462
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:36,609
cassava functional genome using pro C

463
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:40,000
and valine 2015 journalist from Cornell

464
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:43,599
biotech published this article that kind

465
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,450
of exciting me a little bit she was

466
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:50,500
doing this nascent RNA sequencing and

467
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:53,110
the important thing you need to know

468
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,569
about these nation techniques is that

469
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:57,399
allows you to sequence the RNA that are

470
00:23:55,569 --> 00:24:00,970
inside a nucleus

471
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:04,240
so you can sequence the mRNAs before

472
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:07,660
being spliced but you can also sequence

473
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:11,500
all those unstable RNAs that are later

474
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:15,670
degraded in the in the cytoplasm okay

475
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:20,859
and by doing that John and collaborators

476
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:22,539
found that in promoters for example my

477
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:24,669
him that this is your promoter your gene

478
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:26,710
is this part of course you have a

479
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:29,558
transcript going on the only side of the

480
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:32,380
game but what he found was that that

481
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:34,379
there was an unstable RNA also being

482
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:38,140
transcribed on the opposite direction

483
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:41,200
more importantly she discovered that in

484
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:45,309
enhancer regions outside of the genes

485
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,069
there was a similar pattern surrounding

486
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:52,509
the the enhancer will be transcription

487
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:57,279
of of small RNAs in both directions and

488
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:58,539
those RNAs will call enhancer RNA the

489
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,970
next year

490
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:04,240
Charles Danko in collaboration also with

491
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:06,789
Alan cylinder list publish this Dirac

492
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,269
method it was a machine learning a super

493
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:14,619
vector regression machine that will

494
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:18,519
allow you to based on that nasan RNA

495
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:20,979
sequencing identify transcription

496
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,619
regulatory elements including promoters

497
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,509
and enhance and that's what I believe

498
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:28,509
hey maybe we can apply this idea to

499
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:31,619
cassava and identify enhancers that

500
00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:35,980
might be important to explain phenotypes

501
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:39,279
outside of of the games so I was super

502
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:43,349
excited with John we were starting to do

503
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:48,099
the planning and everything and in 2016

504
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:50,740
they publish this article in using nests

505
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:54,459
and RNA in Arabi Topsy's and it was the

506
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:56,230
first study that was performed on lunch

507
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,750
and it was really disappointed at the

508
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:01,390
time because they say you know in plants

509
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,369
there is lack of Ahaz rnase lack of a

510
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:06,220
directional transcription lack of

511
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:08,439
promoter proximal posting i plants are

512
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,789
completely different than mammals and

513
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,860
other metazoans

514
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:14,109
so I was really sad because we were in

515
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:15,869
the middle of an experiment trying to

516
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:19,000
identify these enhancers

517
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:21,189
using the enhancer RNA is that according

518
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,470
to these people were completely absent

519
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,970
in plant but you know we were in the

520
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:29,710
middle of the experiment so we just kept

521
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:31,630
going yeah

522
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,579
so I'll explain a little bit of this

523
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,560
meta-gene clothes so this is what would

524
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:37,869
happen in the human around the

525
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,059
transcription start site so this is

526
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:42,069
where they polymerize the first attaches

527
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:45,490
and then start transcribing back in this

528
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:48,220
direction so you'll have the

529
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:51,299
transcription of the RNA and this peak

530
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:54,940
at the beginning is called the posting

531
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:57,129
phenomenon okay so we're basically the

532
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,720
polymerases are attached to the

533
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,030
beginning of the in and they are just

534
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,620
waiting for an additional stimuli to

535
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:07,359
start transcription so and also there is

536
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:10,299
this bi-directional transcription on the

537
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:12,069
stable RNA in the opposite direction in

538
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:15,480
our ovide offices however they observed

539
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:17,649
two things there is no posting

540
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:23,880
they're just transcription and there is

541
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:27,550
no bi-directional transcription okay so

542
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,560
we were in the middle of experiment and

543
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:31,509
I feel that sometimes when you try to

544
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:33,159
understand a new molecular technique the

545
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:35,650
better thing to understand is go through

546
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,190
the protocol so I will just walk you

547
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:42,519
guys through the protocol a little bit

548
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:44,559
so grow speaker Pro see our it goes for

549
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:47,410
global or precision random sequencing

550
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,710
and what this means a methyl down it

551
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:52,360
does is it will sequence RNA that are

552
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,990
attached to the polymerase

553
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:58,959
inside and so you start with a cleansing

554
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:01,319
here then you have to

555
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,259
nuclei so you will only have the nucleus

556
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:08,129
and you go up here once you have the

557
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:12,369
nucleus you disrupt the nuclear membrane

558
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:15,130
remove the nucleotides the arena and

559
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:18,879
nucleotides and put lots of biotinylated

560
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:23,020
entities into the solution and then lay

561
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,570
the conditions of the cell culture so

562
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:27,940
that the polymerase can will be able to

563
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:32,908
incorporate these nucleotides at least

564
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:35,620
two positions okay then since those

565
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:38,260
entities are biotinylated you will just

566
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:40,959
use a stripper reading with read those

567
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:44,319
and then you just create follow the

568
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:48,240
steps to create a regular nds library

569
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,240
you will end up with the strand-specific

570
00:28:48,960 --> 00:29:00,579
nascent RNA seek libraries so first

571
00:28:55,829 --> 00:29:02,439
result we wanted to check if was that if

572
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:04,269
the things of Surfing arriv'd offices

573
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,580
were the same as we were observing

574
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:10,058
cassava and the first thing that we have

575
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:12,460
service at the cassava nascent RNA

576
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:14,980
profile around the transcription start

577
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:19,149
site is a hybrid between our video

578
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,829
system see there is posting it means by

579
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:25,379
this peak but there is lack of

580
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:28,139
bi-directional transcription if

581
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,270
go to the termination side or sorry the

582
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,280
polyadenylation site at the end of the

583
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:35,519
gene then we see that the cassava

584
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:38,250
profile looks quite similar to the

585
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,950
reveals profile and when the humans

586
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:45,000
don't have this pic at the end of the

587
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:47,039
games so if we you see the start of the

588
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,809
a gene looks like this if you look for

589
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:54,000
the end of the game it looks like this

590
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:55,619
when one of the things that that the

591
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,490
arrival of these people say that was

592
00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:02,369
that there are no pausing in plants and

593
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:05,099
then in cassava we found Ossining plants

594
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:07,679
then they say there is no bi-directional

595
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:10,019
transcription and I kind of saw this

596
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,330
little bump here and say okay let's try

597
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:14,609
to find some genes that might have this

598
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:16,470
bi-directional transcription and of

599
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:20,669
course I found some examples that have

600
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:24,120
it this is an IDE image of the iron is a

601
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:26,550
nascent RNA secretes the gene is going

602
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:29,459
in that direction you have the posting

603
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:32,519
peak and the transcription but you also

604
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,860
have this bi-directional transcription

605
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:37,289
in the opposite direction so they

606
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:40,649
reversed by directional transcription at

607
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:43,259
least in cassava in a way less amount

608
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:47,550
than what was observed in humans but

609
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:50,000
there wasn't so I asked myself like what

610
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:52,879
if if cassava can have bi-directional

611
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,140
transcription missing some genes may be

612
00:30:52,880 --> 00:31:02,010
there so i annotate peaks in intergenic

613
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:04,980
regions first using chromatin

614
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:06,900
immunoprecipitation pick polar in Homer

615
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,329
and I found this pattern of

616
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:12,810
bi-directional transcription across

617
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:15,089
these elements that were outside games

618
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:17,579
so I say okay maybe if I found those

619
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:20,159
elements I can still run the this

620
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:22,049
support vector regression model that was

621
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,000
training mammals to identified

622
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:26,639
transcription regulatory elements

623
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,559
outside the genes I run it I found the

624
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,880
same pattern and now I found 9660 five

625
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:36,569
elements that were transcribed outside

626
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,970
again having these specific patterns

627
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:40,859
so they kind of look like enhancers at

628
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,679
the moment so I try to further

629
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:46,229
characterize them and we had some

630
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,019
methylation that available so I wanted

631
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:51,210
to blow the methylation on in the three

632
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:55,649
different contexts around this video

633
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:59,190
okay this is a and let me explain you a

634
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:05,609
little bit these graphs goes from 0% to

635
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:09,870
100% of an element and then 3kv upstream

636
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:12,959
and 3kv downstream okay this is a random

637
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:14,878
set of regions across the genome so this

638
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,048
is how methylation loosing cassava in

639
00:32:14,878 --> 00:32:22,138
the CH h context in the CPG context and

640
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:25,138
in the CH D context this is the pattern

641
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:28,949
that you observe across genes really low

642
00:32:25,138 --> 00:32:31,699
methylation in the promoter and in the

643
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:35,399
termination and CPG methylation and

644
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:38,298
interestingly they the elements that we

645
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:41,339
found outside genes had this methylation

646
00:32:38,298 --> 00:32:47,278
pattern similar to what is observed in

647
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:49,199
genes but a little inflated for then I

648
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:51,778
was interested also in check how

649
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,870
conserve this elements were in my mind

650
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:58,829
enhancer had to be conserved and I was

651
00:32:54,869 --> 00:33:00,989
kind of wrong so in yellow you see these

652
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:03,388
are grapes course so basically the

653
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:08,388
higher the girls for the most concern

654
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:12,269
those regions are across closely related

655
00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:16,469
species including jatropha flux and

656
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:19,700
normal so basically use again from 0% to

657
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:24,629
100% of the feature we're analyzing

658
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:27,808
yellow is genes super conserve blue is

659
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:30,569
random sequences and in orange

660
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:32,069
it was our enhancer can be a genes and

661
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:35,278
we have served here that they are

662
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:37,169
actually you have non conserved so I was

663
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:41,160
a little worried then I

664
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:44,370
I read this this research was done 2016

665
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:46,320
I believe where they studied enhancer

666
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:50,389
evolution across 20 mammalian species

667
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:57,049
and then found that mammalian a inhale a

668
00:33:50,390 --> 00:34:00,180
enhancers are rapidly evolving sequences

669
00:33:57,049 --> 00:34:02,609
quoting them enhancers are rarely

670
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:04,620
conserved across these mammals unbiased

671
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:06,889
mapping leaks candidate enhancers with

672
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:09,449
lineage-specific positive selection

673
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,220
there's a little bit of evidence on top

674
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:14,759
of Aryans that this thing that we found

675
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:18,959
might actually be enhancers and the last

676
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,480
test that we we want to try is okay if

677
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,059
they they the enhancers might be

678
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,918
important to explain a phenotype they

679
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:30,929
should be explaining more phenotypic

680
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:34,408
variants in any population for for

681
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:37,320
example yield components so we we made a

682
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:38,909
test we have a portion of my genome

683
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,070
invented a host year Calista cassava

684
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:43,829
genome because a small portion one

685
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:46,769
percent of the genome is represented by

686
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:50,029
this enhancer can be a genes what I did

687
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:53,639
is select all the markers inside here i

688
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:56,820
LD protected them so any marker Dell

689
00:34:53,639 --> 00:35:00,059
that would have an R square higher than

690
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:02,100
point nine in a hundred and fifty K

691
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:05,639
region across then I would just asana

692
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:07,710
and then I will a build an another

693
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:10,949
kernel with the rest of the game and I

694
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:13,980
will compare what I have here with my

695
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:16,049
new hypothesis of a random set of

696
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,869
markers that have the same distribution

697
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:22,200
of the enhancer that I found also

698
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:25,589
protected by a frail D and the second

699
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:27,509
card and when we found when the when we

700
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,820
run the genomic partitioning and a

701
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:32,370
percentage of phenotypic variance is

702
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:35,160
explained for several traits on the

703
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:37,739
enhancer region some blue to random

704
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:40,259
reels in orange it is for most of the

705
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:42,809
trace dry matter contain fresh yield

706
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,030
fruit a number root weight and should

707
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:47,699
wait they are explaining way more

708
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:50,860
phenotypic variance than the random sets

709
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:53,859
the only tray that this is not working

710
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:57,099
is for CMD and it kind of makes sense

711
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:58,450
the blue dot is hidden behind but it

712
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:01,989
makes sense because seeing this is

713
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:08,969
regulated by both probably a single

714
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:12,189
locus with a massive QTL well yeah

715
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:14,789
so yeah the is we've made a case where

716
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:19,119
we found these these elements outside

717
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:21,340
genes that are transcribed are not

718
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,609
evolutionary conserved - a specific

719
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:27,840
methylation pattern and explain more

720
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:31,900
phenotypic variants that it's random

721
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:34,990
counterparts so we we kind of think that

722
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:37,329
this might be enhancers and this will be

723
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:41,469
a really nice method to identify them in

724
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:43,750
plants and I think that's it

725
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:47,739
thank you very much it was a really a

726
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:49,750
big big big big team efforts when I went

727
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:52,299
to you land actually I really understood

728
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:58,829
the effort that is put into getting one

729
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:58,830
of your data sales are so yeah

730
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:11,030
this has been a production of Cornell
