00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,519
branching out is the IPM newsletter for

6
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,198
trees and shrubs and it covers insects

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,359
and diseases of Woody plants so we

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,320
publish every two weeks from April

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,279
through June and every three weeks from

provide um timely information on all

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,200
aspects of Pest Management um on Woody

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,359
ornamentals the newsletter itself was

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,920
started by Dr George hudler in the Plant

15
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,759
Pathology Department at Cornell in 1994

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,679
as a master's project for one of his

17
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:50,759
graduate students um I came on board in

18
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,960
July of

19
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,519
1996 and for those of you who can do

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,359
math yes that is 20

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,680
years of writing branching out so um and

22
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,280
so you may have heard that George has

23
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:08,239
retired in January of this year but um

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,840
he is still working with me on the

25
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,879
branching out newsletter as the

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,118
co-editor and he says he will continue

27
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:17,759
to do that for as long as I'd like to

28
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:20,239
continue to do it

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,519
so um our target audience for the

30
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,280
newsletter is treat care uh

31
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,319
professionals so arborist and Golf

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,640
Course superintendent and urban

33
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:33,639
Foresters and that sort and and our goal

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,840
is to inform these pest managers on the

35
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,159
progress of insect and my diseases on

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,478
Woody ornamentals in uh the New York

37
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:45,359
state area and to a lesser degree we

38
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:48,078
cover uh concurrences of symptoms of

39
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:52,239
non-infectious plant problems too such

40
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:55,478
as freezing injury and winter drying and

41
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,560
drought so the way we do it was We

42
00:01:55,478 --> 00:02:00,438
Gather all this information by a

43
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,039
combination of on-site scouting and

44
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:05,879
reports from other contributors to help

45
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:12,080
us prepare the articles about the um

46
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:15,719
pest so um and We Gather the all the

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,560
observations and we prepare them into a

48
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,280
uh commentary about the subsequent life

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,080
stages of the pest and then scouting

50
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,560
tips that might be helpful and um

51
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,239
preventative or Curative actions and

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,280
management Alternatives as well what do

53
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,719
is I drive down I have a mix of

54
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,519
different places that I go so I I drive

55
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:42,039
downstate to um Long Island and I visit

56
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,879
various sites and the County Extension

57
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:47,799
offices then I return back to itha and

58
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,000
but along the Route I make uh

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,879
predetermined stops at Orange

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,959
Westchester and NASA counties on each of

61
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:58,518
our trips so so this is our one of our

62
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:02,199
stops we stop at the at Farmingdale

63
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:05,680
College in Nassau County well I'm also I

64
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:08,959
also stop at hofra University when I'm

65
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,280
down there and planting fields are bitum

66
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,000
as well so it's not too terrible

67
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,919
Planting Fields you may recognize that's

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,280
a very famous uh site that's often taken

69
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,000
uh photos of at Planting

70
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,318
Fields um and then one of the other

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,280
sites we stop at was we I go to a

72
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:32,958
cemetery in Westchester County scouting

73
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,959
in the cemetery um some cemeteries are

74
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,000
very Barren but this particular one has

75
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,959
a nice mix of uh trees and shrubs and uh

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,158
luckily they don't treat anything so

77
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,640
that's good for me another day of the

78
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,959
week I go to the western part of New

79
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,839
York State I go to fingerlakes Community

80
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,560
College which has a nice little

81
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,878
Arboretum there and that's in Wayne

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,719
County and then I also go to uh Highland

83
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,719
Park in Monroe

84
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:04,318
County so and I revisit these specific

85
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,000
sites in this the state so that's the

86
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,839
same sites all the time so I have an

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,840
idea of what I'm looking for each spot

88
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,840
but um you know I get surprises all the

89
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,639
time you just keep an eye out for things

90
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,478
that aren't looking good if a little off

91
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,439
color u a little Browning or something

92
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:25,079
and or you know sometimes I'm looking

93
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:27,120
and I'm seeing a lot of maybe um ants or

94
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,439
flies or something and I'm like oh

95
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,600
there's a lot of honeydew over there

96
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:33,639
what's happening with that plant so um

97
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,639
so by revisiting these specific sites

98
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,560
and doing the on-site scouting I can

99
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,478
keep a good you know monitoring those

100
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,639
pest populations on a regular basis and

101
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,839
can keep a good eye out for that um and

102
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:49,038
then we then I also have several sites

103
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,439
in the itha area that I Scout on

104
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:54,399
including my own property which is an

105
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,160
abandoned Christmas tree farm so when my

106
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,839
husband and I bought that property eight

107
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,439
years ago um George asked me if we had

108
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,359
paid extra because of all the great

109
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,560
diseases I told him that we have on our

110
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,759
property so he was thrilled to hear that

111
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,519
we had a nice infection of pine pine G

112
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,038
rust and white pine blister rust and um

113
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,918
variety of other nice Conifer diseases

114
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:18,639
and insects as well I pretty much we

115
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:22,839
could do a scouting uh trip right to my

116
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,400
property so in addition to my own onsite

117
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:29,399
scouting I also have Cornell Cooperative

118
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:31,758
Extension agents that uh and some arur

119
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,918
that help contribute observations for

120
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,439
The Scouting Report section as well and

121
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,198
that helps kind of give a nice little

122
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:42,959
snapshot of pest populations in the

123
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:46,560
entire State at any given time so that's

124
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:50,079
that's how it's done so the newsletter

125
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,839
itself in each issue we in addition to

126
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,159
the scouting report we include a feature

127
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:57,560
article and that gives us an opportunity

128
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,960
to address a particular pest or other

129
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,399
topic in more detail than we can can in

130
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,918
the other columns

131
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,719
so uh in the last several years we've

132
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:09,719
been able to upgrade and include color

133
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,880
photos and the scouting reports as well

134
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:16,240
as the feature article thanks to some

135
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:19,079
generous donations from um arborist and

136
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,280
such and we also include Growing Degree

137
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:24,598
Days and phology in each

138
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:27,559
issue and we try to keep the the text

139
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:31,038
pretty easy to read and just the right

140
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,918
length to cover each topic we know the

141
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,399
um Tree Care Professionals out there are

142
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,680
really busy and they're just looking for

143
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,638
a quick snapshot they need to know what

144
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,439
do they need to look for this week you

145
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,000
know they don't they don't have a lot of

146
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:47,839
time to uh you know read a ton of text

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,079
and so we try to boil it down to just

148
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,560
the essentials okay this is what they

149
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:56,079
need and um they can just look at that

150
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:00,399
or share with their staff and go right

151
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:02,120
out there and use that information so

152
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,159
um let's see one of the things this

153
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:08,000
season we hope to do is something new

154
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,639
George would like to make some videos

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,918
which uh then we would link from a QR

156
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,199
code that we would include in the

157
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,719
newsletter so if any of you know George

158
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,680
you know that he's quite the

159
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,280
Entertainer this is Jen um I do want did

160
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,000
want to say that we take those those

161
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,159
Center folds so whatever you call them

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and we post them in our our Diagnostic

163
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,800
lab they're great reading uh so when

164
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,519
volunte have you know a little bit of

165
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,199
time um they can peruse that you know

166
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,000
and it's very helpful because I think

167
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,439
that what comes in often reflects that

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,478
uh that that list so yeah that's what

169
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,399
we're kind of hoping is that's a

170
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:50,719
reflection of what's going on out there

171
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:53,038
and so and we and we go downstate um to

172
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,120
scout because really they're often a

173
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,478
week or more ahead of the the rest of

174
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,038
New York State especially up here in

175
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,359
central New York or a little F farther

176
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:04,478
north so we know it's it's well worth

177
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,280
our time to go down there and to get

178
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,639
that scouting information because

179
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,079
they're a bit ahead so often what we'll

180
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,120
see last week in Long Island is just

181
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:16,279
happening this week and uh and you know

182
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,519
Parts farther north than New York

183
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:22,119
State okay so here's a just quick look

184
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:26,399
at our website pretty simple basic but

185
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,199
it's got information um so about

186
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,079
subscription information you can also

187
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,038
look at back issues if you're not

188
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,759
familiar with the uh newsletter we've

189
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:38,038
got back issues

190
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:40,080
here uh idea of what the newsletter

191
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:41,718
includes it's that branching out

192
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,158
self-supporting through subscription

193
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,760
charges and donations and the normal

194
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,799
charge for the subscription is is $50

195
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,639
but as Cornell Cooperative Extension

196

205

share with to bring to the attention of

210
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:30,240
tre Care Professionals in your county so

211
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:32,039
right now we have about 400 subscribers

212
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,720
including some big names like the

213
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:38,159
Smithsonian and Longwood Gardens and pul

214
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,920
Smith's college um and they the majority

215
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,799
of our readers are from New York State

216
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,919
or the New England states but we have a

217
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,599
handful from other States including Ohio

218
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:49,000
and Michigan and Illinois in addition to

219
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,720
the newsletter we also published a book

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,200
so it's a 150 updated feature articles

221
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:59,440
it's about 300 Page book and that is $35

222
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,440
which is to kind of finish up I think

223
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,680
think some of the uh things that we were

224
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,440
really noticing this season that seem

225
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:09,719
some of the highlights are uh winter

226
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,600
injury we're seeing a lot of desiccation

227
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,560
on Spruce and true Furs this spring so

228
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,000
we had a nice article in the last um

229
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,278
issue and issue number three Sandra

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,958
Jensen from the Diagnostic lab wrote a

231
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:27,559
nice article all about the um

232
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:31,719
desiccation on conifers and so that we

233
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:33,199
are getting a bunch of questions on and

234
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,959
uh right now what we're seeing out in

235
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,639
the field is uh this is a Time season

236
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:41,159
for different rusts to be sporulating so

237
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,600
there's lots of Cedar rust are out there

238
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,399
and their full glory and white pine

239
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,759
blister R Us is kind of just finishing

240
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:52,839
up but we've got pine pine G Rus coming

241
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:55,759
and um from Don Gable down in uh the

242
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,440
botanic garden in New York said that he

243
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,720
thinks it's going to be a banner year

244
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,480
for or Cedar rust from what he was

245
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,480
seeing

246
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:10,839
so and then um the other interesting

247
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,959
tidbit was we got a report from um Long

248
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,639
Island that boxwood Leaf Miner was

249
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,958
emerging rather early this year so it's

250
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,959
it's really a couple weeks earlier than

251
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,518
we expected but it came from a very

252
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:26,278
reliable source and he even saw the

253
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,959
pupil cases so we're sure that he knows

254
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:31,480
what he's saying but so we um so I had a

255
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,719
conversation with Dan gillery and we

256
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,240
were both surprised that it was coming

257
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,600
out a little early but we so we've

258
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,560
included that in this week's scouting

259
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,320
report and that's the sort of stuff that

260
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:43,719
we like to put in things that are you

261
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,399
know maybe slightly unusual and and so

262
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,680
we do welcome anything that's um you

263
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,919
know happening in your county we'd love

264
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,000
to hear any information especially if

265
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,319
you've got outbreak situation of

266
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,839
something um we'd like to share that

267
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,079
with our readers so they know what's

268
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,160
going on in the state and it's nice for

269
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,879
us because we can't be everywhere though

270
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:09,559
I Scout in many places it's really just

271
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:11,519
a snapshot in time and um I can't I

272
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:14,838
can't go to all the sites in New York

273
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,159
state but so anything that if you know

274
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,600
if you're want if you'd like to share

275
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:23,480
with us we'd be uh willing to take any

276
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,159
information that um you have to share so

277
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,600
and I'm sure you've all seen the

278
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:29,799
problems with blue

279
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,800
spruce that continue

280
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,838
there are no there's no one answer

281
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,439
unfortunately on that one but so we're

282
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,199
we're kind of keeping an eye on seeing

283
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,800
what's happening with the the blue

284
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:43,559
spruce this season it's been kind of a a

285
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,599
problem for the last couple of years I

286
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:48,159
know many of you have seen that as well

287
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,560
and and we're seeing down in the lower

288
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:55,240
Hudson Valley a lot more is it Spruce

289
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:57,239
budall mge um then I suspect we've been

290
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,519
seeing it for a while and we didn't know

291
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,278
what we were looking at we were finding

292
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,959
all kinds of other things as well and

293
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,639
that was good enough you know what I

294
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,719
mean in a sense you're saying oh it's

295
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,879
got this and it's got that now that

296
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,040
we're looking for it we're finding it in

297
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:13,879
a lot of spruce samples Norway spruce

298
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,599
okay yeah yeah we you know we've put a

299
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:18,078
little bit of information about that in

300
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,920
the newsletter a couple for the last

301
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:23,759
couple of years Dan Gil's been very

302
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,759
