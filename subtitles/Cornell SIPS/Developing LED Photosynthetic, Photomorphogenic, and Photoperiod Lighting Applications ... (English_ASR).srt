1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,520
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,519
university

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,440
well thank you neil for the introduction

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,519
and basically today what i'm going to do

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,119
is i'm going to talk to you all about

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,039
the work that we've been doing at purdue

7
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,559
with led lighting

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,160
so this is our our greenhouse is at

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:26,399
purdue and as you can see our

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,399
our leds uh nice and glow in there

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,000
so in terms of a floor culture and you

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,359
know

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
we can talk about other crops we tend to

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,439
really focus on light

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,640
quantity light quality as well as light

16
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,159
duration

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,759
and with each of these we can manipulate

18
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,238
them to

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,679
have our crops do specific things so

20
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,238
with light quantity you know

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,759
we primarily use high pressure sodium or

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,959
metal halide lamps to

23
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,640
increase the daily light integral with

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,679
light quality we can use filters or

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,520
shading

26
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,359
and then with photoperiod primarily

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,800
growers would use incandescent

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,679
lamps obviously those are being phased

29
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,679
out of production so

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,438
ultimately these are the responses that

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,640
we're looking for well now

32
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,879
we have good sorry so now we have

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,840
leds which we can use to basically look

34
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,359
at both

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,960
well look at photosynthetic

36
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,319
photomorphogenic as well as

37
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,759
photoperiodic

38
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,118
light responses so one of the primary

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,079
areas of research for me

40
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,599
is lighting of young plants and that is

41
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,719
primarily because

42
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,559
when we think of northern uh latitudes

43
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,719
this is what we often see we see very

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,600
low light daily light integrals

45
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,200
and for propagators they really want to

46
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,640
minimize the amount of time

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,560
that those young plants are in the

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,280
greenhouse they want to optimize the

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,320
quality

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,960
and also just

51
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,199
you know reduce that timing when we

52
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,559
think of the photosynthetic daily light

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,200
integral

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,920
outdoors in the north we typically have

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,640
anywhere from 5 to 20 moles of light

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,280
and to produce a high quality young

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,718
plant

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,040
research has shown that we want to be

59
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,039
more within the 10 to 12

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
mole range so when we move within a

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,239
greenhouse we can have further

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,200
reductions of anywhere from 50

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,719
or more uh or less excuse me due to the

64
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,679
structures the glazing material et

65
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,359
cetera

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
where we can ultimately have a daily

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,239
light integral within a greenhouse

68
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,560
during pr

69
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,759
peak propagation of anywhere from one to

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,039
five moles which is

71
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,840
is quite low so this are basically two

72
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,359
maps

73
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,878
and we're looking at the average

74
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
greenhouse daily light integral in

75
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,159
february which is when we're propagating

76
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,439
a lot of cuttings and also growing a lot

77
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,519
of seedlings

78
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,639
and this is the average greenhouse daily

79
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,200
light integral

80
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,318
so you can see that in the north there's

81
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,159
a large benefit

82
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,799
in terms of using supplemental lighting

83
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,400
to get that target dli of 10 to 12 moles

84
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,800
of light

85
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,239
so we've been doing uh research with

86
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,280
rooting of cuttings for several years

87
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,000
this is work that we

88
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,719
looked at using high pressure sodium

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,318
lamps

90
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,318
and as you can see when you increase

91
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,280
that daily light integral you obviously

92
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,280
increase that

93
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,640
root dry mass you end up with more

94
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,878
branching so you

95
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,559
ultimately can get that cutting out of

96
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,158
the production house

97
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,039
much faster so when we look at northern

98
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,000
latitudes especially like say new york

99
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,158
michigan

100
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,360
daylight integrals in this range are not

101
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,598
uncommon during that time period

102
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
this is some work done at michigan state

103
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,479
and you can see that

104
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
here what they've done is they basically

105
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,598
have looked at when to use high pressure

106
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,360
sodium lighting whether it's

107
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,639
early on or later on in terms of the

108
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,519
plug production and you can see the

109
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,439
effects of

110
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,200
obviously providing supplemental light

111
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,400
during three stages of

112
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,719
of the seedling stage and

113
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,840
ultimately it reduces the time to

114
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,400
produce that plug but also increases the

115
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,239
quality

116
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,560
so when we look at biomass production

117
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,360
it's very uh cultivar dependent

118
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,360
so we see that root dry mass increases

119
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,760
with increasing daily light integral

120
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,040
obviously each species is responds

121
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,438
differently

122
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,120
we see that photosynthesis also

123
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,719
increases as we would expect

124
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,480
so this is what basically what we're

125
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,759
looking at is this is that

126
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,919
um stick and then we start to see that

127
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,039
um that daily like excuse me as daily

128
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,399
light integral increases

129
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,199
photosynthesis increases so this leads

130
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,719
me to

131
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,799
the first study that we're going to talk

132
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,720
about this is some work that

133
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,359
my former graduate student chris curry

134
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,560
worked on he basically wanted to look

135
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,120
at supplemental lighting

136
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,319
using various sources so what we did is

137
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,280
we basically

138
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,159
looked at leds where we had 100 percent

139
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,638
red light

140
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,160
or and no blue light and then we had

141
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,319
increasing amounts of blue light from

142
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,880
anywhere from 15 to 30 percent

143
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,639
we also had our control which was our

144
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,759
high pressure sodium lamp

145
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,160
and we provided 70 micro moles of of

146
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,520
light

147
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,520
for 16 hours each day

148
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,280
so here's our spectral quality for the

149
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,959
various leds

150
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,879
and of course the high pressure sodium

151
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,680
so you can see our

152
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,680
our different peaks

153
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,840
and this is basically what we found so

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,879
we have our high pressure sodium and our

155
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,279
increasing amount

156
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,399
of blue light from zero all the way up

157
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,478
to 30.

158
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,439
and what's the the one thing that you

159
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:24,159
notice between

160
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:28,079
both the impatiens and the petunia

161
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,720
in terms of uh above and below ground uh

162
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,719
biomass

163
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,360
yep exactly there there were there were

164
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,639
virtually no differences

165
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,720
so that was i guess you know it depends

166
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,478
on who you're talking with

167
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,800
whether that's good or bad so we also

168
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,800
looked at photosynthesis for the the

169
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
three species and basically we had

170
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,038
the same photosynthetic rates under high

171
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:56,239
pressure sodium lamps or under 100

172
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,918
red or with increasing amounts of blue

173
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,600
light

174
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,279
so what we did is then we grew the

175
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,800
plants under a common environment so we

176
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,719
took them out of propagation

177
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,560
and we placed them into a greenhouse

178
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,560
with 20 degrees celsius

179
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,839
and a target daily light integral of 10

180
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,038
to 12 moles of light

181
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,839
and we finished them to see if there

182
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,918
were any residual effects of

183
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,839
basically propagating them under high

184
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,240
pressure sodium lamps or leds

185
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,439
and again we did not see any difference

186
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
in time to flower

187
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,959
heightened flower nodes below the first

188
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,439
flower

189
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,599
so really some of the conclusions that

190
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,519
we were able to make from this study

191
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,680
is that there were very few statistical

192
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,198
differences among the cuttings

193
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,959
when we used various sources of

194
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,879
supplemental light

195
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,719
and obviously there were few differences

196
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,319
among flowering plant responses

197
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,319
so there were no beneficial or

198
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,479
detrimental effects of using

199
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,680
leds for vegetative propagation

200
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,159
so our next study we wanted to basically

201
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,478
look

202
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,080
at seedlings so we think of a cutting

203
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,680
and when we get a cutting you know it

204
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:01,198
obviously comes from either

205
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,759
central or south america or africa

206
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,560
and we that cutting spends about a week

207
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,400
in the greenhouse

208
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,160
forming callus and then it's in the

209
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,519
greenhouse anywhere from two to three

210
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,439
weeks more

211
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,799
when we have a seedling that seedling we

212
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,319
place it under lights

213
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,919
right after germination and it's in the

214
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,800
greenhouse anywhere from three to four

215
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,079
weeks

216
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,439
so we basically had uh similar

217
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:26,318
lights so 100 red um 85

218
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,279
red 15 blue and then the 70 and 30. we

219
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,160
had a different

220
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,719
uh or different leds that we use in this

221
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,759
study

222
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,520
and we increased our light intensity to

223
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:40,400
100 micromoles for 16 hours a day

224
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,240
again here's our spectral distribution

225
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,439
for the various leds as well as the high

226
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,680
pressure sodium lamps

227
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,759
and we used a wide variety of bedding

228
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,519
plants so these are basically the top 10

229
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,360
bedding plants that are produced in the

230
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,038
u.s

231
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,560
i'm just going to present to you today

232
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,199
the petunia just because of

233
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,720
of time but with the seedlings we

234
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,639
definitely saw dramatic

235
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,039
differences between those that were

236
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,038
produced under leds versus uh the high

237
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,360
pressure sodium lamps

238
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,560
so here what we're looking at is uh the

239
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,160
stem length

240
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,839
so with plugs we want them to be nice

241
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,000
and compact right because we're going to

242
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,519
one grower is going to produce them

243
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,038
place them in a box and ship them to

244
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,719
another grower so we want these

245
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:21,918
these plugs to be nice and compact so

246
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,120
you can see that under high pressure

247
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,680
sodium lamps

248
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,800
they were much more taller compared to

249
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,598
under leds

250
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,840
so when we inc when we used blue light

251
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,918
we tended to have even more compact

252
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,519
seedlings when we looked at stem caliper

253
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,278
there were basically no differences so

254
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,959
in terms of stem caliper we want

255
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,799
a sturdy ceiling that's going to be able

256
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,479
to withstand transportation

257
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:47,120
not break in that box

258
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560
in terms of root dry mass obviously root

259
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,240
dry mass is important because

260
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,399
if those seedlings root faster they're

261
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,519
going to be rooted into that

262
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,080
plug tray so there were basically not

263
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,600
a whole lot of differences the only

264
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,800
difference were between the 85

265
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,320
85 percent red 15 blue and the

266
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,958
uh 70 30. again would shoot dry mass

267
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,200
not a lot of difference as well so again

268
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,559
we wanted to grow these plants out

269
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,240
in a common environment see if there

270
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,239
were any residual effects of the

271
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,560
supplemental lighting during propagation

272
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,159
and as you can see here they pretty much

273
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,000
all flowered

274
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,919
at very similar times so there were no

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,799
statistical differences as well as

276
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,799
the height at flower

277
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,559
so we found that plug quality was

278
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,759
similar whether

279
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,958
the seedlings were grown under high

280
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:39,278
pressure sodium lamps or under leds

281
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,159
or in some instances they were a better

282
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,679
quality

283
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,600
and the finished plant quality was not

284
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:47,039
significantly influenced

285
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,080
by the propagation supplemental lighting

286
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:53,439
so then this led to the next study where

287
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,560
there's been an interest by u.s growers

288
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,760
of producing plugs indoors so we wanted

289
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,759
to look at

290
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,600
whether we could produce a high quality

291
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,200
bedding plant seedling indoors using

292
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,040
sole source lighting

293
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,079
versus producing a plug in a greenhouse

294
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,480
so what we did is is we maintained a 23

295
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:12,479
degree

296
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,399
constant day or night temperature and we

297
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,920
wanted to achieve a daily light integral

298
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,759
of about 10 and a half moles

299
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,360
so in the greenhouse we wanted to

300
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,759
achieve that with sunlight

301
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,200
plus supplemental lighting and in the

302
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,639
grow chamber we wanted to achieve that

303
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,640
just with sole source leds

304
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,679
so these are the different treatments

305
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,240
that we had in the greenhouse so we had

306
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,759
a no supplemental lighting control and

307
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,360
we decided we didn't obviously in the

308
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,759
two previous studies we didn't have

309
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,399
a ambient control and that was something

310
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,919
that

311
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,440
when i talked to growers i obviously

312
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,599
have an extension appointment

313
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,279
they often don't realize the benefits of

314
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,680
using supplemental light so i wanted to

315
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,278
really

316
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,958
you know show them that there are

317
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,480
differences

318
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,919
and then in terms of our supplemental

319
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,120
lighting treatments those lights were on

320
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,759
for 16 hours

321
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,360
we provided 70 micromoles and we had a

322
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:03,200
high pressure sodium lamp

323
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,639
we also use plasma lamps and then we had

324
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,320
one led treatment so we had one that had

325
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,679
88 percent red and 12 percent blue light

326
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,519
in the grow chambers we looked at two

327
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,039
light qualities so we had the same

328
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,360
as in the greenhouse and then we had

329
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,480
another treatment that had

330
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,200
18 percent more blue light

331
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,639
so these are various treatments so we

332
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,680
had our high pressure sodium

333
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,278
our greenhouse leds and then our plasma

334
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,559
in the greenhouse and then here are two

335
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,639
sole source lighting

336
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,119
treatments so we we did a multi-layer

337
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,120
production

338
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,639
here's our spectral distribution for the

339
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,639
various

340
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,199
light treatments

341
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,559
and this was probably uh in terms of the

342
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,200
studies that we did with

343
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,759
uh young plants you can definitely see

344
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,600
that there

345
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,720
are some major differences between the

346
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,320
plants that are produced in the

347
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,519
greenhouse so the ambient high pressure

348
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,639
sodium plasma

349
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,720
and then this supplemental leds you can

350
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,000
see the the differences between those

351
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,759
that were produced in the greenhouse

352
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,879
versus the ones that were produced under

353
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,360
sole source

354
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,639
leds so let's look at the data a little

355
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,320
closer

356
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,519
so those that were produced under plasma

357
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,278
lamps were quite elongated compared to

358
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,799
the other supplemental lighting

359
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,720
treatments as well as under sole source

360
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,240
lighting

361
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,079
we also found that the relative

362
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,519
chlorophyll content so we used basically

363
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,599
used a spad meter

364
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,000
and as you provided supplemental light

365
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,159
or

366
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
sole source light we definitely saw that

367
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,838
the relative

368
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,720
chlorophyll content increased but a big

369
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,680
increase under

370
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,879
sole source lighting in terms of leaf

371
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,039
area

372
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,320
leaf area increased when you provided

373
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,319
obviously more light

374
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,719
in terms of root dry mass as we would

375
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,078
expect uh compared to the ambient

376
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,560
control and the one thing i forgot to

377
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,679
mention

378
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,199
is the ambient

379
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,399
treatment we had about six and a half

380
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,839
moles of light and that was obviously

381
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,559
from the sun and then we were providing

382
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,320
an additional

383
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,319
four moles from from the supplemental

384
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,560
lighting so we saw an increase

385
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,000
in terms of our root dry mass but the

386
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,479
highest occurred under sole source

387
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,399
lighting and then we had an increase in

388
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,399
shoot dry mass but it was relatively

389
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,839
similar between the various lighting

390
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,639
treatments

391
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,160
so again we finished the crop under a

392
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,680
common environment to see if there were

393
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,000
any residual effects

394
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,120
and here is where we we did see some

395
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,720
differences

396
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,639
and one of the differences that you see

397
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,120
is obviously petunias are a long day

398
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,879
plant

399
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,519
so they require long days in order to

400
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:34,240
flower so under our ambient conditions

401
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,679
in the winter after three weeks they had

402
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,120
not flowered

403
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:41,359
plasma lamps provide quite a bit of heat

404
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,320
so that obviously helped in terms of

405
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,159
time to flower

406
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
the high pressure soda there is a flower

407
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:49,439
bud there it's hard to see

408
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,839
but here what we can see is that when we

409
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,880
had

410
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,639
only 12 blue light basically we were

411
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,198
providing about 22 micro moles of blue

412
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,198
light

413
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,359
there was a delay in terms of time to

414
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,679
flower not a significant delay

415
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
but work that's been done at michigan

416
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,638
state has actually shown that you can

417
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,600
use blue light

418
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,959
to um and basically use blue light

419
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,800
instead of far red light to induce

420
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,958
flowering responses in

421
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,159
in flora culture crops so we're actually

422
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,679
going to do some more work

423
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,600
in this area this coming winter

424
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,958
so in terms of of time to flower you

425
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,199
definitely see

426
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,479
that the uh that there were differences

427
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,479
hide it flower

428
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,839
in terms of horticulturally those

429
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,199
differences were not very

430
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,279
significant so we found in this study

431
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,719
that the quality of bedding plant

432
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,278
seedlings

433
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,879
produced under sole source excuse me

434
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,559
supplemental lighting was similar or

435
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,600
greater to those grown under ambient

436
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,838
light

437
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,800
also seedlings of the species that we

438
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,560
studied

439
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,159
were of higher quality or similar

440
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,599
quality when they were growing under

441
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,519
sole source lighting when we compared

442
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,600
those to supplemental

443
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,720
and the only two species where we found

444
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,839
that there was a difference in time to

445
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,680
flower was

446
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,320
impatience and the petunia that i showed

447
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,319
you today

448
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,679
so we believe that sole source lighting

449
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,759
is

450
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,879
is a viable option for growers who would

451
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,039
like to produce

452
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,240
bedding plant seedlings indoors because

453
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,639
they can obviously

454
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,039
control the parameters not only the

455
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,600
light but also temperature

456
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,559
humidity and carbon dioxide which is

457
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,480
going to produce

458
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,759
uniform cuttings or excuse me uniform

459
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,320
seedlings throughout

460
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:29,360
the peak production cycle

461
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,800
this is a study that we basically just

462
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,839
finished up a few weeks ago i actually

463
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,359
just got the

464
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,079
data from my student a few days ago

465
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,720
so josh well there's two josh's but josh

466
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:42,239
garavac

467
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,040
wanted to look at producing microgreens

468
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
indoors and he wanted to basically look

469
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,240
at both

470
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:53,278
light quantity as well as like quality

471
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,639
so we had three species that we looked

472
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,000
at

473
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,480
we used basically a fiber hydroponic

474
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,078
tray

475
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,680
it's a it's a pad and i'll show you a

476
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,719
little bit later and

477
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:08,239
our environmental set points

478
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,920
were 21 during the day 17 at night

479
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,159
and then we maintained a relative

480
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,759
humidity of 50

481
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,679
during the day and 60 at night and then

482
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,320
we had a set point of 500 parts per

483
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,519
million

484
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,560
co2 in terms of the leds that we used in

485
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,278
this study

486
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,399
we used the the same leds that we've

487
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:25,198
that i've showed you in the previous

488
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,159
study

489
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,758
but we had an led on this one that had

490
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,958
far red light

491
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,199
and then this one had a green light

492
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,879
and we achieved three target daily light

493
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:37,838
integrals so we basically wanted to have

494
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,439
a low

495
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:45,120
dli and then increase that amount

496
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,920
to from 6 to 12 and then 18

497
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,679
and these lamps were on for 16 hours a

498
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,879
day

499
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,278
so here's our various uh leds so you can

500
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,000
see

501
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,399
the uh what they look like and obviously

502
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,159
what

503
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,679
the micro greens look like under the

504
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,480
leds so you can see that when we have

505
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,599
the

506
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,078
the green and blue you can actually see

507
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,919
the the

508
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,918
actual color of the micro greens

509
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,679
so here's our spectral distribution for

510
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,798
the

511
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,480
various uh treatments obviously as as

512
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:21,838
you increase that intensity

513
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,838
uh you see that the peaks also increase

514
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,360
it's a little bit it might be a little

515
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,679
bit difficult for you to to see this

516
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,439
from the back but what's the one

517
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,280
major difference that you notice when

518
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,320
you increase

519
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,319
the daily light integral

520
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:46,240
okay i hear bill bill basically said the

521
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:47,840
answer there

522
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,960
so this is something that we have

523
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,480
noticed um

524
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,079
when you increase the amount of blue

525
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,000
light we

526
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,678
we actually noticed this on geraniums so

527
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
you think of a zonal geranium and you

528
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,480
know

529
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,519
the zonal part when we increased that

530
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,599
amount of blue light

531
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,960
we saw an increase in anthocyanins here

532
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,480
we're basically

533
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,319
what in the 11 to 12 range

534
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,839
in terms of blue light but with an

535
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,480
increased daily light integral whether

536
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,079
you

537
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,759
had far red or green light you

538
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,240
definitely see

539
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,919
an increase in anthocyanins here's

540
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,400
another species this is a

541
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,759
kohlrabi a species that doesn't

542
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,759
necessarily show

543
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:30,240
the red pigmentation or anthocyanins

544
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,240
and here we're basically looking at

545
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,319
those micro greens so

546
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,519
you see that under a low daily light

547
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,519
integral it doesn't really matter in

548
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,200
terms of the light quantity

549
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,798
as you would expect they're much more

550
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,759
elongated but it really depends on the

551
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:43,519
market right some

552
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,038
individuals might want microgreens that

553
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,519
are a little bit taller

554
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,960
others may not with that increased daily

555
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,440
light integral we see that they're

556
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:57,840
much more compact and also we see that

557
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,840
expression of anthocyanins

558
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,079
so let's look at uh some of let's look

559
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,480
at the data so

560
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,199
obviously those were all done at one

561
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,240
temperature

562
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,400
yes yes exactly

563
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,000
so here we're looking at the hypocaudal

564
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,919
length so we've got our

565
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,679
are basically our three like uh

566
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,120
quantities and our increasing daily

567
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,960
light integral from 6 to 18 moles

568
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,439
so as we increase our daily light

569
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,840
integral the hypocotyl length decreases

570
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,960
on in terms of leaf area the more light

571
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,720
we provide them

572
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,558
the smaller the leaf area so is that a

573
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,480
good or a bad thing well in terms of

574
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,079
of microgreens what is it that we're

575
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,558
ultimately

576
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,079
trying to achieve right more biomass and

577
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,038
so that might not necessarily

578
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,599
be a good thing where we have a decrease

579
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,359
in

580
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,759
leaf area here we have a percent dry

581
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,519
weight

582
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:51,759
so obviously increasing

583
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,960
light quantity we have an increase in

584
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,038
dry weight

585
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,640
in terms of like quantity there are

586
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:57,839
really no differences

587
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,080
here we're looking at the relative

588
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,879
chlorophyll content so again

589
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,558
some slight increases with increased

590
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,840
daily light integral

591
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,440
but really this is i think one of the um

592
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,759
nice things is we looked at total

593
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,519
anthocyanins and you can definitely see

594
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,679
that with that increased

595
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,798
like quantity there's definitely a

596
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,400
difference

597
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,839
in the total anthocyanins and this is

598
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,440
for the kohlrabi we if we would have

599
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,279
looked at the other species that

600
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,279
definitely has a dark darker foliage we

601
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,200
probably would have seen more dramatic

602
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,720
of a difference we looked at total

603
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
phenolics there were virtually no

604
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,839
differences between

605
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,839
uh those light quantity different light

606
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,839
quantities and light qualities

607
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,038
so this leads us to another study

608
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,720
this is garrett owen and he's been

609
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:46,158
working in on this for

610
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,919
about a year now one of the things that

611
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,559
we typically tend to notice when we go

612
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:54,240
to production greenhouses especially

613
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,798
in march and april is you see a lot of

614
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,079
this

615
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,000
you know there's a lot of hanging

616
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,519
baskets and then obviously crops growing

617
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,599
below

618
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,960
well panacetium rubrum purple fountain

619
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:07,279
grass is a very popular

620
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,319
ornamental grass one of the problems

621
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,599
however

622
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,439
is that because growers have such well

623
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,519
especially in the north low light levels

624
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,440
and then you put hanging baskets above

625
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,918
them you're really reducing that

626
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,200
daily light integral and so often uh

627
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,320
these grasses are actually

628
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,240
green they're not very purple um you

629
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,519
know you take a closer look and this

630
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,120
is purple fountain grass but you

631
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,240
wouldn't know that if if you were just

632
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,678
looking at it in

633
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,400
in a garden center or in a greenhouse

634
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,120
so obviously color is a key component

635
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,559
consumers

636
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,319
obviously buy purple fountain grass

637
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,558
because it's purple they want to have

638
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,200
add some color into their landscape

639
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,798
as well as when we think of red leaf

640
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,519
lettuce so often when you go into a

641
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:48,960
greenhouse

642
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,440
and they're not providing supplemental

643
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,440
light their red leaf lettuce

644
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,519
is green and so in terms of color

645
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,000
obviously it's attributed to chlorophyll

646
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:03,599
carotenoids flavonoids

647
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,119
and anthocyanins this is a

648
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,038
purple fountain grass that's been cut

649
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,479
back it was grown in a greenhouse in the

650
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,240
glass glaze greenhouse during the summer

651
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,839
and you can obviously see the

652
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,319
the increased anthocyanins

653
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,678
so as i mentioned before with the

654
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,960
addition of blue light

655
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,038
we've noticed uh that you can uh

656
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,640
increase anthocyanin production and

657
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:25,359
obviously there has had been some work

658
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,799
that had

659
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:32,000
showed this previously so we thought of

660
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,519
of a new concept it was basically called

661
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,279
end of production supplemental lighting

662
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,079
so let's say a grower produces their

663
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:40,000
lettuce or their pennisetum under the

664
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,079
same conditions they always do

665
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,319
but they light the crop at the end so

666
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,319
let's say anywhere from

667
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,678
one to two weeks before they're going to

668
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,439
ship that crop out

669
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,200
they can increase the color enhance the

670
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,240
quality

671
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,679
so we thought of a way of

672
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,519
quantifying this by using a uh

673
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,960
a portable meter this is a meter that's

674
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:05,119
often used in the food industry

675
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,240
to measure color um

676
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:10,558
so what we did is is with the

677
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,759
pentacetum as we started off with plugs

678
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,519
that were grown in

679
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,759
new hampshire so you can definitely see

680
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,000
how light

681
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,640
in color they are not much purple

682
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,400
pigmentation we grew those out

683
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,840
to for about 55 days and in order to

684
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,240
create the daily light integral that we

685
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,519
would have during peak production

686
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,200
which would be march april

687
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,558
we had a daily light integral about 6

688
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,080
moles this is the

689
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:40,000
daily light integral that we would find

690
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,000
under those those hanging baskets

691
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,120
we then basically place the plants under

692
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,720
end of production lighting so i'm going

693
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,439
to show you the different treatments

694
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,919
our daily light integral basically from

695
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,038
the

696
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,480
sun was close to nine moles of light and

697
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:56,960
these are the various treatments so we

698
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,200
had

699
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,319
a control photo periodic control that's

700
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,360
which gave us about

701
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:06,158
four micro moles of light then we had

702
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,519
a treatment where we had 100 red a

703
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,960
combination of 50

704
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:14,079
50 red and blue i get our

705
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:19,200
88 12 and then we had uh 100

706
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:21,038
blue at 25 50 or 100 micromoles

707
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,480
so here's our our spectral quality for

708
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,480
the various treatments

709
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,360
and here we're looking at the um the

710
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,319
lettuce grown under the

711
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,798
50 50 red and blue leds 100 percent

712
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:35,678
excuse me yes 100 blue leds and here we

713
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,558
have the

714
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,038
the panacetum here's at night so you can

715
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,678
actually see uh

716
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,558
the leds and how the uh the lettuce

717
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,840
looks quite

718
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:50,399
dark but i'll show you what it actually

719
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,399
looked like so these are basically

720
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,240
using that colorometer we looked at the

721
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,319
l star

722
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,319
the a star and the b star and i'll talk

723
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,200
about that in just a bit

724
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,319
so basically the the al star is a

725
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,919
measure of lightness

726
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:08,798
so um as you get closer to zero

727
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,520
whatever that meter is measuring is more

728
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,000
on the

729
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,879
towards uh black then as the number

730
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,519
increases towards

731
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,120
100 it's more white in terms of what we

732
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:20,480
were looking for was more of this

733
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:23,119
red green so a positive a star told us

734
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,798
the the pigments were obviously more red

735
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,278
and in terms of b-star

736
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,000
whether there was a tendency of of the

737
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:31,359
pigments

738
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
turning more blue so we took

739
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,839
measurements

740
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,278
on day one basically when those plants

741
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,079
were placed under end of production

742
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,000
lighting

743
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:42,720
and then at 3 5 7 14 and 21 days

744
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,400
so this is what our plants look like so

745
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,278
this was about two weeks or three weeks

746
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,278
excuse me

747
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,558
uh before a grower would typically ship

748
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,000
out the plant toward

749
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:54,798
to a garden center or retail

750
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,440
greenhouse so these are initial

751
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,359
measurements

752
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:03,360
in terms of the l star a star and b star

753
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:05,599
and this is after seven days of

754
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,519
end of production lighting so here again

755
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,000
the all-star is a measure of lightness

756
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,200
from

757
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,159
white to black so our control you can

758
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,278
see

759
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,679
was about 31.1 and we saw

760
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:21,200
a decrease in that number when we had a

761
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:23,679
combination of both red and blue light

762
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,480
as well as one we provided a hundred

763
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,960
micromoles of blue light alone

764
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,000
if we light the crop for yet another

765
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,120
week

766
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,440
we see that obviously the plants are

767
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,959
obviously much darker in color and we

768
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,000
see a

769
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,919
again the decrease in that l star what

770
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,960
about the a star

771
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,960
well a negative means green

772
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,159
a positive means blue so as we go from

773
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,278
the control

774
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,240
to a 50 50 uh combination of red and

775
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,798
blue or

776
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,679
100 micro moles of blue we obviously see

777
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:57,599
that number is

778
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,440
is more positive and now visually we can

779
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,199
see that but we wanted to quantify that

780
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,038
and if we add another week we see that

781
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,080
that number definitely

782
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:09,119
increases so the longer we have those

783
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:12,240
plants under that end of production

784
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,278
red or blue or 100 blue we definitely

785
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,720
saw a difference

786
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:18,240
and then here we're looking at the b

787
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,240
star so this is a change from

788
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:26,000
yellow to blue so again um

789
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,679
control was 6.2 we see that that

790
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,558
number has decreased so we're becoming

791
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:34,159
more blue and again

792
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:36,639
as we increase the the time

793
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,240
so here's a visual close-up of this is

794
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,919
after 21 days of end of production

795
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,319
lighting and we're looking at individual

796
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:48,720
uh leaf blades so that 50 50 combination

797
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:50,879
or the 100 mic 100 micromoles of blue

798
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,159
we definitely see that those blades have

799
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,600
colored up and the really interesting

800
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,760
thing is

801
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,959
if you were to pick up let's say we had

802
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,480
two leaf blades that were

803
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,480
like this if you were to pick this one

804
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,480
up it would be green

805
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,399
underneath so it's it's really only

806
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,360
those uh leaves that are that are

807
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,558
receiving that

808
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,119
higher intensity of of uh blue light are

809
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:11,278
actually

810
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,959
uh the anthocyanins are increasing in

811
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,919
those leaves

812
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,360
so here's a close-up this is uh 14 weeks

813
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,159
later so you can definitely see the

814
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,639
difference

815
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,640
in terms of of the color

816
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,798
we also looked at a cultivar of geranium

817
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,640
this one has a really dark foliage it's

818
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,000
called black velvet and again you can

819
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,038
see that

820
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,240
a 100 micro moles of a blue light or a

821
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,679
combination

822
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,679
of this is just 100 percent red or

823
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,278
or combination of red and blue

824
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,240
definitely increases

825
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:48,798
the pigmentation we also wanted to look

826
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,880
at lettuce as i mentioned before

827
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,798
red leaf lettuce growers often have a

828
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,760
challenge under low light conditions of

829
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,519
of actually having it be so these are

830
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,079
all red leaf lettuce cultivars but you

831
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,918
would not

832
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:03,278
know that because they were obviously

833
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,159
grown under a low dli of 6 moles

834
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,038
so again we looked similar treatments

835
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,799
and again

836
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,038
here's the al star you can definitely

837
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:14,079
see after seven days

838
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,200
that number has decreased really with

839
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,678
the lettuce

840
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,038
five days was enough to get it to go

841
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,480
from basically green

842
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:24,720
to a nice dark red

843
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,679
here's our a star you definitely see

844
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,798
that number has

845
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:32,080
has increased quite a bit

846
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,079
as well as our b star

847
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,038
so with our pentacetum we found that

848
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,399
anywhere from 7 to 14 days of end of

849
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,480
production lighting

850
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,239
whether we provided a combination of red

851
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,399
or blue light or

852
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,159
100 percent blue light at 100 micro

853
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:52,839
moles was effective

854
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,720
at increasing the pigmentation change in

855
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:58,240
color

856
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,880
and with the um

857
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,079
red leaf lettuce five to seven days was

858
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,080
enough

859
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:07,918
again using the same uh two treatments

860
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,240
and the last study that i'm going to

861
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,880
talk about today is basically

862
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,440
looking at so obviously here we're

863
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,159
looking at the photoperiodic responses

864
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,440
so the greenhouse industry typically

865
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:24,240
uses

866
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:26,080
incandescent bulbs to induce flowering

867
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,079
so we can obviously classify a lot of

868
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,278
our greenhouse floor culture crops as

869
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:33,359
day neutral

870
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:35,359
uh short day as well as long day

871
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,839
in order to schedule these crops into

872
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:41,278
for specific market dates

873
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,278
we can use photo period

874
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,360
the typical things that growers will use

875
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,599
is either a night interruption so

876
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,398
they basically will turn on these lamps

877
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,359
from let's say

878
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,158
10 pm to 2 am to interrupt the night and

879
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,319
basically

880
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,919
the plants perceive a long day or they

881
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,000
can use day extension lighting

882
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,840
where at sunset they'll turn on the

883
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,240
lights for a specific amount of time

884
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,720
to provide a long day so uh you know

885
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,399
these are

886
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,000
our various treatments that growers can

887
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:09,199
use here we have a point poinsettia

888
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,038
crops so they're using

889
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,120
a blackout cloth to obviously provide a

890
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:16,839
short day to induce the crop

891
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,079
in the flower or here they're using day

892
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:20,558
extension

893
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,439
so as i said before incandescent bulbs

894
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,480
have been used for

895
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,038
for many years they emit a relatively

896
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,599
low

897
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,319
amount of red light and a high amount of

898
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,719
far red light

899
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,240
obviously far red light is what's needed

900
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,038
in order to induce

901
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,480
flowering they're very electrically

902
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:40,240
inefficient only about

903
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,519
six percent efficiency short life span

904
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,798
and obviously they're being phased out

905
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,759
of production so what is what are

906
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,000
growers going to use

907
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,679
well there's our next alternative is the

908
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,359
compact fluorescent lamp

909
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,840
the only problem with these lamps is

910
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,879
they emit a high amount of red light and

911
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,398
a relatively low

912
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,640
amount of far red light um

913
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,199
with certain species like wave petunias

914
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,240
which have a high response in terms of

915
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,440
their

916
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:09,519
or in terms of of light for a long day

917
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,519
response they flower

918
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,480
it's delayed basically under compact

919
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,919
fluorescent lamps

920
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,200
the life of cfls is also reduced by the

921
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,120
number of times that they're turned on

922
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,840
and off which can be a problem

923
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,479
and of course they contain mercury which

924
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,599
has some

925
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,360
serious disposal issues high pressure

926
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,119
sodium lamps can also be used for

927
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:34,639
photoperiodic lighting

928
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:36,319
you can use them for cyclical lighting

929
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,759
but of course they're energy intensive

930
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:41,119
they're expensive

931
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:44,158
and they emit heat so

932
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:46,079
we have leds uh with leds as

933
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,519
i've showed you we have different light

934
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,158
qualities that we can use

935
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,679
um they have a longer operating life the

936
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,240
spectra can be tailored

937
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,080
uh based on what whatever response we're

938
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,519
looking for whether it's

939
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,199
as i showed you before a

940
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,278
photomorphogenic response

941
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,480
or photoperiodic response the only

942
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,278
problem is the cost

943
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,159
so these are commercially available led

944
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:09,278
lamps that

945
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,640
are now on the market so what is the

946
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,640
incandescent bulb cost

947
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,960
for a four pack i think you could

948
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,440
probably get them for about two dollars

949
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,960
and

950
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,399
uh cfl not very much these are about

951
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,120
fifty dollars so

952
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,000
in terms of the the life you know they

953
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,479
they can last

954
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,240
many many years i believe the estimate

955
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,558
is about 50 000 hours

956
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,519
but of course you know growers in order

957
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:35,359
to get them to

958
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,359
to switch over to these that's a big

959
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,439
investment

960
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,079
so what we did is we looked at a wide

961
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,200
variety of both long day

962
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:48,319
and short day plants and we wanted to

963
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,600
um well i'm getting ahead of myself we

964
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:52,879
basically had an automatic

965
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,639
blackout curtain system so we

966
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,960
had a nine hour base photo period which

967
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,559
was from the sun

968
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,319
which was from 8 am to 4 pm

969
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:03,759
and then we provided high pressure

970
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,960
sodium or

971
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:06,558
increase the daily light integral with

972
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,320
high pressure sodium lamps which gave us

973
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,320
about 70 micromoles at plant height

974
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,719
we had a common greenhouse environment

975
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,638
for betting plant production

976
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,480
and the one thing that we wanted to look

977
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,358
at were the responses under low daily

978
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,599
light integral

979
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:26,799
versus high high daily light integral

980
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,800
we created so we used day extension so

981
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,519
we had a 10 hour photo period of 13 or

982
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,119
16 hours

983
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,039
where basically the lamps were on for

984
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,159
either one four

985
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:37,279
or seven hours and the first lamp

986
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,639
basically contained

987
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,280
red light white light and far red light

988
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,280
and this lamp only contained red and

989
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,560
white so no far red

990
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,639
the one thing that we had been hearing

991
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:49,199
from growers especially growers in the

992
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,519
south

993
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,398
or on the west coast was that they could

994
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:55,199
use

995
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:56,878
this red and white lamp and basically

996
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,279
they would have a flowering response

997
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:00,960
where growers in the north would say

998
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,599
that they could not use

999
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,519
these lamps only these so what's what's

1000
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,400
the one thing in terms of using far red

1001
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,400
light that

1002
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,838
i've obviously told you the benefits in

1003
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,440
terms of flowering but what's one of the

1004
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,440
negative drawbacks of far red

1005
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,799
stem elongation so that's that's a bad

1006
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,519
word in

1007
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,560
in the greenhouse industry um so here's

1008
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,199
our our photo

1009
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:27,199
periodic lighting we were providing um

1010
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,519
we wanted to provide

1011
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,239
two micro moles of photoperiodic light

1012
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,480
because that's

1013
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,078
what a grower would typically provide so

1014
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,679
we actually had to use a screen over

1015
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,720
these lamps because our system is

1016
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,879
is quite low and you can see that we

1017
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,879
we only place plants where they would

1018
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,000
receive two micro moles and not near

1019
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,440
or directly underneath those lamps so

1020
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,800
here's our

1021
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,920
our pansy crop you can see we achieved a

1022
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,320
daily light integral of about six moles

1023
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,599
here we have our leds that had red white

1024
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,400
and far red light

1025
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,000
so this is a long day plant so under a

1026
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,880
10 hour photo period you see that it

1027
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,079
took

1028
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,400
61 days to flower when we provided

1029
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,760
16 a 16 hour photo period we reduced

1030
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,039
that by nearly three weeks

1031
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,000
so if you're really you know if you're

1032
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:17,039
trying to schedule this crop into flower

1033
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,280
obviously providing long days

1034
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,039
is going to reduce that time to flower

1035
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,599
what about

1036
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,880
under just red and white light well you

1037
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,160
can see that there's basically no

1038
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,240
statistical difference so

1039
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,199
under a low daily light integral even

1040
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,319
though we were providing

1041
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:34,559
long days the crop was delayed by uh

1042
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,160
quite a bit compared to when we use far

1043
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,838
red light

1044
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:41,039
so again the negative drawback of using

1045
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,199
that far red light

1046
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,639
is there was an increase in stem

1047
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,078
elongation

1048
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,719
when we compared those crops that were

1049
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,440
grown under red white far red

1050
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,118
versus just red and white light alone so

1051
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,079
here's our pansy or excuse me petunia

1052
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,760
crop

1053
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,320
relatively low daily light integral

1054
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,200
under six moles of light

1055
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,640
you can see that as you increase your

1056
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,199
photo period there's a

1057
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,960
reduction in time to flower of course

1058
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,559
there's that negative drawback in terms

1059
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,800
of that stem elongation because of that

1060
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,960
far red light

1061
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,320
under just red and white light the crop

1062
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,079
whether it was growing under a short day

1063
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,880
or a long day flowered

1064
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,920
basically at the same time again we see

1065
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,440
the

1066
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,838
the difference in height and there's

1067
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,519
definitely differences between the two

1068
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:31,279
leds

1069
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:33,599
here's a snapdragon again a delay

1070
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,400
under short days and a delay when we use

1071
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,400
just red and white light

1072
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,838
so this coming summer we're going to do

1073
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,160
the work where we're going to look

1074
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,759
at a higher daily light integral and see

1075
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,319
if

1076
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,880
our hypothesis is that growers in the

1077
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,559
south

1078
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,000
and in the west coast one of the reasons

1079
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,599
they can use these

1080
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,119
red and white leds is that they're

1081
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,480
getting enough far red light because

1082
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,039
they have such a high daily light

1083
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,679
integral

1084
00:37:55,039 --> 00:38:01,838
versus in the north so again

1085
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,879
those height differences and here what

1086
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,838
we're looking at

1087
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,119
is a shore day plant so marigolds are a

1088
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:08,320
short day plant they're a facultative

1089
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,400
short egg plant

1090
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,359
you can see that when we grow them under

1091
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,720
short days they flower faster

1092
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,880
than under long days eventually

1093
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:17,358
obviously they will flower under long

1094
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,760
days

1095
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:21,598
so here we have a daily light integral

1096
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,880
of about 8 moles and here

1097
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,320
15 moles you can see that there's

1098
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,559
not a lot of difference in terms of the

1099
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,440
short days but we are going to look

1100
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,440
at this with long day plants this coming

1101
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,639
summer when we can really achieve these

1102
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,639
high daily light integrals

1103
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,039
so some of the conclusions from this

1104
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,519
study is that under low dll

1105
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,400
low dli low intensity leds with far red

1106
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,719
light obviously

1107
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,000
they increase stem elongation but they

1108
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,039
hasten flower

1109
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,400
time to flower for long day plants

1110
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:56,480
under low dli the leds that had

1111
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,079
did not have far red light obviously

1112
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,880
there was reduced stem elongation but

1113
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,839
there was a delay in time to flower

1114
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,880
so in terms of growers in the north they

1115
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:07,920
can use

1116
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,599
these leds in lieu of

1117
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,920
let's say a compact fluorescent or an

1118
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,200
incandescent and they can have market

1119
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,639
ready

1120
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:18,000
plants obviously it's very species

1121
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,000
dependent in terms of the response

1122
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,039
so with that i'd like to thank the

1123
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:26,159
following

1124
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,719
organizations companies for obviously

1125
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,519
funding

1126
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,559
as well as for plant material

1127
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,679
fertilizers

1128
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:37,440
etc and with that

1129
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:37,440
i think we have some time for for some

1130
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:46,960
questions

1131
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:49,440
uh basically the question was are t5

1132
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,559
uh lamps being used in greenhouses and

1133
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,000
were you asking basically for the

1134
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,838
photoperiodic lighting or

1135
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,440
oh no just in any commercial capacity

1136
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:57,440
because the only place i see them is for

1137
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,480
um

1138
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,800
is for like uh house plants and like

1139
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,679
home gardening and stuff okay so think

1140
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,000
of the fixture

1141
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,679
and so in a greenhouse when we want to

1142
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,800
provide whether it's supplemental

1143
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,559
or photoperiodic lighting we want to get

1144
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,280
as much sunlight as possible right

1145
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,719
well with a fixture for like like a t5

1146
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,400
that's a that's a lot of fixture where

1147
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,358
you're basically blocking out a lot of

1148
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,960
sunlight

1149
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,318
and so that's that's one of the reasons

1150
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,079
why we don't see them in greenhouses but

1151
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:24,880
we do see them in the same road chambers

1152
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,480
or for

1153
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,480
indoor production of sure house plants

1154
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,439
um the led fixtures you showed in the

1155
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:43,440
last experiment looked like

1156
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,119
they were edison base designed for 120

1157
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,800
volt

1158
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:51,119
fixtures and

1159
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,119
if we move to a future where we get away

1160
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,519
from the backward compatibility

1161
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,760
you can make them more affordable

1162
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:01,838
because there you have

1163
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,720
your uh your power regulation circuitry

1164
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,159
you need one

1165
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:08,480
per bulb and it's

1166
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,480
um

1167
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,760
if you just forget about the backward

1168
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,959
compatibility

1169
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:20,160
you can you can then design

1170
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:24,159
your leds to be optimal uh

1171
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:27,279
for cost and other properties as well

1172
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:28,399
yeah so so the um leds that i showed in

1173
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,040
the last experiment

1174
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,960
they're basically a replacement for

1175
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:35,119
incandescent or compact fluorescent

1176
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,480
where they're a screw-in tight bulb

1177
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,838
where all of the others

1178
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,920
look low intensity so um yeah they're

1179
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:42,639
basically made to replace those lamps

1180
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,440
where

1181
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,719
the other lamps that i showed you right

1182
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,480
now

1183
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:50,078
there are some lamps on the market in

1184
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,800
terms of the supplemental lighting that

1185
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,640
are

1186
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,839
uh called a high pressure sodium

1187
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,639
replacement

1188
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,838
but uh they're still i would say a few

1189
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,920
years where we're really

1190
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:01,279
it's going to take a while while longer

1191
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,440
to get those

1192
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,839
hps replacements with a high intensity

1193
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,119
led

1194
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,838
have you done any work with analyzing

1195
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,680
the cost

1196
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:13,279
of the you know the purchase cost of the

1197
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,799
leds versus

1198
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,839
hps or fluorescence in the case of

1199
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,720
chamber lighting okay so the question

1200
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:24,559
was have we done

1201
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:26,879
any uh cost comparison in terms of using

1202
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:29,199
high pressure sodium versus the leds and

1203
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,400
so we were part of the usda

1204
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:33,679
ser scr our grant and there's someone at

1205
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,519
purdue who's actually doing that

1206
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,879
component so hopefully within this year

1207
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,280
you will have all of that

1208
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,358
it's taken a lot longer it's much more

1209
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,240
difficult than we first

1210
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,039
anticipated in terms of getting the the

1211
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,479
data

1212
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,400
because he's basically getting the data

1213
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,679
from all of the researchers to then look

1214
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,119
at

1215
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:54,879
the cost and you know how long does a

1216
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,440
grower have to have

1217
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:02,720
the leds and so on

1218
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,159
in your last study it seemed like stem

1219
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:07,039
elongation and

1220
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:09,358
flowering response in long day plants

1221
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:12,079
were closely coupled

1222
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:12,880
and i wonder if there's any way to break

1223
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,560
that

1224
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:19,119
that connection perhaps by cyclic

1225
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,318
lighting of some sort so that you're

1226
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,079
giving

1227
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,800
as you remember that at least the theory

1228
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,519
says that

1229
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,800
if the last light the plant sees in a

1230
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:32,079
day

1231
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,920
then if it's red then the stems will

1232
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,480
stay short

1233
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,159
if it's far red then the stems will

1234
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,679
become longer

1235
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:44,480
but i don't know if that also influences

1236
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:47,440
the for the period response as far as

1237
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,920
flowering's concerned

1238
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,079
so the question was uh in in our studies

1239
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,880
we use day extension lighting

1240
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,119
and uh what what sort of responses would

1241
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,000
we give with night interruption lighting

1242
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,280
and so eric uncle at michigan state he

1243
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,559
is focusing on the

1244
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,440
night interruption and typically a night

1245
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,519
interruption

1246
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,720
is four hours you can do cyclical

1247
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,559
lighting which

1248
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:11,759
obviously you can reduce the amount of

1249
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:13,920
time that you lightly crop

1250
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,599
and he's actually yes found that a four

1251
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,519
hour night interruption of the birds are

1252
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,960
much more compact than under day

1253
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:23,199
extension

1254
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,519
as you would expect

1255
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,759
with the the phillips i think the term

1256
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:31,519
you use is like production

1257
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,720
module so so phillips i guess has come

1258
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:36,239
up with some

1259
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:39,199
recipes of red and blue leds that they

1260
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,399
think work pretty well are those

1261
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:43,679
generally

1262
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,160
useful for a wide variety of plants or i

1263
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,960
need to

1264
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,440
to what extent will there need to be

1265
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,079
optimization for different crops

1266
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,358
so from the first studies that we did we

1267
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,200
had the 100

1268
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:59,279
red the 85 15 and then the 70 30.

1269
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:00,480
um across the various vending plant

1270
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,599
species we found that

1271
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,240
85 15 was a good combination you know

1272
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,318
when you took

1273
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:08,399
everything into account and the work

1274
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,960
that they had done in the netherlands

1275
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,400
they came out with the ada 12 which i

1276
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,079
showed a lot of the

1277
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:19,519
questions and so that was a good um

1278
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,640
should i say uh basically a good

1279
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:22,639
combination of both red

1280
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,598
and blue light that they found with uh

1281
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:24,400
they were looking primarily in

1282
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,440
vegetables

1283
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,519
in the netherlands and uh

1284
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,039
so that's a good good combination

1285
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,358
obviously the more blue light you add

1286
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:38,800
the more expensive

1287
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:42,159
pictures what's the psychological effect

1288
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,160
of these weird colors

1289
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,760
that's a very good question so i can get

1290
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:50,880
back

1291
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,920
uh well this is low intensity so it

1292
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,519
really

1293
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,318
doesn't work but where that when we are

1294
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:56,318
in the growth chamber

1295
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,358
this has been shown at various places

1296
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,358
when you're under leds some people

1297
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,318
actually get nauseous

1298
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,318
i am one of them

1299
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,879
so

1300
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,119
for example this is in the walk-in

1301
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,559
chamber

1302
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,960
when you walk into the chamber and let's

1303
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,639
say you're in there for even a minute

1304
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,519
you walk out and everything you see is

1305
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:26,239
great if i'm in there for more than

1306
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,599
15 minutes i feel nauseous when i come

1307
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:28,000
out and there's a lot of people that say

1308
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,160
the same

1309
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,480
thing so that that is definitely a

1310
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:32,480
problem

1311
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:45,279
you can't really see it

1312
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,880
these are more of a red and white and

1313
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,040
those don't really bother

1314
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,400
uh your eyes nearly as much as when you

1315
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:53,199
have the blue light

1316
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,639
alone or excuse me red and blue light so

1317
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:57,118
the addition of the green light

1318
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:58,960
or phosphorus coating on the leds

1319
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,519
definitely helps out a lot

1320
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,079
so we are going to be doing more studies

1321
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,159
with

1322
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,839
white light and i think for humans

1323
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:09,039
that's definitely going to

1324
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:10,400
be a better

1325
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,358
thinking in terms of those of us that

1326
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,358
get nauseous under them

1327
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,839
maybe instead of recruiting in grad

1328
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,838
school you should go to the dance clubs

1329
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:30,639
you talked a little bit earlier about

1330
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,680
how much more

1331
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,480
flexibility you have in the geometry of

1332
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,239
the layout

1333
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,559
so that it doesn't block light that sort

1334
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:40,479
of thing um

1335
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,000
what kinds of things might we expect in

1336
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,358
terms of the geometry of where the

1337
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,719
lights are placed so you get the right

1338
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:45,920
light distribution and they're not in

1339
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:47,199
the way for other things you're trying

1340
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,318
to do

1341
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:52,318
so that is one thing with the uh

1342
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:53,599
high pressure sodium versus an led so a

1343
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:54,719
high pressure sodium we tend to have

1344
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,960
more of the light

1345
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,318
you know spreads out with for leds it's

1346
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,199
very directional

1347
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,400
so a lot of the leds that are on the

1348
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,639
market you have to have them

1349
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,599
relatively close to the crops in order

1350
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:10,318
to get a uniform light intensity

1351
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,200
some of the newer higher intensity ones

1352
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,558
that are

1353
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:16,000
quoted as the hbs replacement

1354
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,000
they're getting better because they're

1355
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,039
concentrating more leds

1356
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,159
and let's say an area this big

1357
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:24,639
and so you're getting you can place them

1358
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:25,838
higher

1359
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:27,838
and you're getting that increased

1360
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:29,599
uniformity but

1361
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,199
one thing that i tell growers when they

1362
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,880
ask me about supplemental life is they

1363
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,159
say wait

1364
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,240
they're really interested in the

1365
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:38,960
technology um but

1366
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,838
i i tell them if i were you i would wait

1367
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,240
and if there's if they still want to

1368
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:44,960
go into the leds i tell them to look at

1369
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:46,639
the various

1370
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,318
there's so many leds on the market

1371
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:51,118
there's a lot of claims

1372
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:52,239
that are sometimes a little outrageous

1373
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,000
so

1374
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:55,358
just tell them to do studies on their

1375
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,440
own and see which one

1376
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:59,440
best fits their particular situation

1377
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,079
you can get the white leds and holes

1378
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,280
embedded in this

1379
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,599
uh clear silicone like stuff they're not

1380
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,079
very expensive they're pretty bright

1381
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,000
very flexible literally but also in

1382
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,359
terms of installation

1383
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,880
is that one of the hardware

1384
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:20,480
implementations you think we might see

1385
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,240
for supplemental lighting

1386
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,159
well the thing you need to think about

1387
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:27,279
with leds is that the life

1388
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,318
of the led is dependent on the

1389
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,800
temperature

1390
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:31,920
and so uh in a greenhouse you know

1391
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,318
especially where we're going to mount

1392
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,400
these

1393
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:37,119
um it's definitely going to have an

1394
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,119
effect on

1395
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:40,318
how long those leds are going to last

1396
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,519
and so the method of cooling

1397
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:44,079
is very important so with a system like

1398
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:46,079
that

1399
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,280
um yeah i mean they can be relatively

1400
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,200
cheap but you're probably going to have

1401
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,640
to replace them quite a bit

1402
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:54,078
and i'm not sure what sort of uh you

1403
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,078
know intensity you would actually

1404
00:49:56,838 --> 00:49:59,838
um

1405
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,318
yes yes so the first leds that i showed

1406
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,358
um

1407
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,159
we had basically a band on them to pull

1408
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:10,960
them

1409
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,318
and in some instances those leds use

1410
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,559
more energy than the high pressure

1411
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:17,279
sodium so

1412
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,920
it's the method of cooling definitely

1413
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,599
affects

1414
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,599
the energy usage

1415
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,839
all right let's thank our speakers

1416
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:33,598
this has been a production of cornell
