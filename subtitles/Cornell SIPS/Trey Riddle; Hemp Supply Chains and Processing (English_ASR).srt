a minute pretty exciting to have some

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,000
some folks coming in um today i' I've

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,599
been asked to speak a little bit about

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,800
uh the the hemp supply chain um and uh

65
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:49,919
but I want to talk for just a minute

66
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,120
right here about the goodness of hemp um

67
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,759
so I am from IND hemp and this is a

68
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,879
slogan that we used to we we like to use

69
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:59,519
the goodness of him means a lot to us

70
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,878
and and the people in the industry um so

71
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,439
we really to promote right is uh how can

72
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:05,280
we make things better how can we make

73
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:09,199
them good with hemp so it's a bit of an

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,080
ethos that uh that we live with um as

75
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,479
far as an outline where we're going to

76
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,719
go today um I'll I'll talk for I don't

77
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,919
know 30 to 45 minutes but uh but I

78
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,598
really am looking forward to having the

79
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,000
Q&amp;A and and understanding what your

80
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,119
guys's questions are I think it's a lot

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,840
more meaningful if I can address those

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,400
specifically um and but I'll start with

83
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,878
talking a little bit about IND hemp so

84
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,560
you know who we are um the meet will

85
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,199
come in as we talk about a CO

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,680
coordinated supply chain and can look at

87
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,639
that in the lens of three different

88
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,799
sectors agriculture processing and then

89
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,639
markets uh spent a little bit of time on

90
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,680
Lessons Learned and and bottlenecks and

91
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,919
opportunities and strategic initiatives

92
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,840
um Davis Hof did a great job last week I

93
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,000
am less prepared than him uh I think he

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,400
gives a lot of a lot of talks as a

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,759
professor so I hope you guys stick with

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,920
me and uh what I say is relevant but

97
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,158
that's why we got the Q&amp;A to to be sure

98
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,399
that you get what you want out of this

99
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:07,840
um a little bit about IND hemp uh you

100
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,920
know we are a family owned in an

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,479
operated business uh The Elliots uh

102
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,199
founded us several years ago um

103
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:19,079
originally looking at uh at at phyto

104
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,280
remediation Ken is a geologist that

105
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,639
worked in super fund sites around the

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,799
world and trying to figure out how to

107
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,639
clean up those those sites by

108
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,319
traditional means as a career but then

109
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,240
post that career started getting

110
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,279
interested in hemp as a FAL mediator um

111
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,759
he actually owns an old Refinery site in

112
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,119
in Montana but then uh then actually

113
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,759
found out about the great things

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,120
happening just across the border in

115
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,319
Canada um around grain and the need for

116
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,720
Alternatives um in our you know in our

117
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,959
Farmland here in the US in Montana

118
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,680
specifically uh and the applicability of

119
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,159
what was happening in Grain up there so

120
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,079
I hemp actually started as a as a hemp

121
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,520
Grain Company Kim convinced his daughter

122
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,000
uh Morgan to join on she she came from

123
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,599
the other side the Dark Side from ADM

124
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,399
Archer Daniels Midland uh where she was

125
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,280
a chemical engineer there working in

126
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,560
large corn and soybean uh processing

127
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,478
facilities um and she came over to have

128
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,759
some fun with us uh here at IND H and

129
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:19,478
founded IND

130
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:22,360
H we really take uh our ethos seriously

131
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:24,800
people plan it and and profit pretty

132
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,240
much in that order uh what you see on

133
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,160
the screen here is a is a picture of

134
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,120
Fort bitton Montana that's where I am

135
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,720
today

136
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,240
Central Montana in the in the prime

137
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,440
growing region what we call the Golden

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,400
Triangle called the Golden Triangle

139
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:41,800
because so much wheat is grown here uh

140
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,959
Fort bitton was uh sort of a Pioneer

141
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,800
town it's how Montana and much of

142
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,839
Pacific Northwest was was settled the

143
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
steam ships would would come up uh the

144
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,959
Missouri uh the Mississippi River to the

145
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,120
Missouri River and basically couldn't

146
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,478
get any farther than Fort Benton and so

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,519
a lot of history here uh so it's a great

148
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:04,879
spot to to Pioneer him as well a tal of

149
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,560
13400 people uh primarily supported by

150
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,240
Agriculture and then a little bit by

151
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,038
tourism having our infrastructure here

152
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,598
is really meaningful you know to the uh

153
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,719
to the town and to the region both in

154
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:18,800
terms of employing folks directly into

155
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,960
the company but then also supporting

156
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,120
acreage uh in the region uh we really

157
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,359
you know live behind that uh to to be

158
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,240
supportive of our people then also the

159
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,560
planet we think what we're doing here as

160
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,560
as I hope everybody on the call does uh

161
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,879
is is Meaningful and that we're we're

162
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,800
looking at new ways to implement

163
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:39,759
agricultural solutions to some of the

164
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,280
world's problems be that food or uh non

165
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,360
sustainable materials and

166
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:47,279
whatnot um and you know our vision our

167
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,960
mission as a company um really has a lot

168
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,198
to do with the talk today uh which is

169
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:54,519
you know connecting that that innovators

170
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,360
at the agricultural level uh with the

171
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,198
pioneers in in industry and that's

172
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,520
really what this value chain is all

173
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,360
about right is how do we go from a a

174
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:07,598
commodity off the farm to something that

175
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,560
a consumer can actually use and um takes

176
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,120
a lot of dots to get connected you know

177
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,839
to do that and everybody has to uh be

178
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,840
rewarded and see value along the way and

179
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,560
so our vision is really to create a a

180
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:21,519
supply chain that's profitable and

181
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,038
sustainable and we really do value and

182
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,758
lean on our personal relationships I

183
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:27,759
wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for

184
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,439
other folks in this industry and other

185
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,840
Industries you know caring about what

186
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,279
we're doing and engaging um we actually

187
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,439
come back to that a little bit at the

188
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:40,119
end of this talk and how meaningful that

189
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:42,680
can be in building uh viable Supply

190
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,399
chains um we're pretty Diversified in

191
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,439
hemp space uh at least in the industrial

192
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:51,000
hemp space that is uh we don't do

193
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:54,240
anything in in CBD at all U but our

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,038
product lines are hemp seed Foods uh

195
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,360
hemp feed and and animal supplements and

196
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:02,158
then hemp fiber so gives us pretty

197
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,319
Diversified portfolio um of activity

198
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:07,639
there to uh and to support diversity on

199
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,000
the on the farm as

200
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,639
well I want to make a shout out here to

201
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,319
gentleman Pier barard that we had the

202
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,240
pleasure of working with over the last

203
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,639
couple of years um he has written a

204
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,800
report and published it on his website

205
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,280
biosolutions initiatives I encourage

206
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,199
everybody to go take a look at the

207
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,519
report I mean it's free and it's an

208
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,000
amazing uh resource uh I actually uh uh

209
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,359
grabbed a number of his images and

210
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,559
whatnot because I think they speak

211
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,959
directly to some of the the conversation

212
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,239
that's happening here around Supply

213
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,359
chains and how we can make viable

214
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,158
lasting Supply Chains It's a little bit

215
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,440
of plagiarism but I worked really close

216
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,879
with Pierre on some of this and I think

217
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,480
he uncovered some some some really

218
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:50,480
important uh you know lessons on how we

219
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,800
can make this this work so um check that

220
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,360
out check the report out check his

221
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,399
website out reach out to him he's a

222
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,278
great

223
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,320
guy uh so you know what we'll talk about

224
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:04,679
today is is the supply chain and in

225
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,879
essence what is really needed is a

226
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:09,439
coordinated supply chain right we can't

227
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,600
we can't do this in a bubble uh

228
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
individually um you know we all need

229
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,959
customers we all need suppliers that's

230
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,760
at every level of the supply chain and

231
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,479
uh you know I like to say that we're not

232
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,879
really building uh we're not building

233
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,959
just a company we're building an

234
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,720
industry and we're doing that from the

235
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,278
ground up uh and that really results in

236
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,480
integrated and dependent Supply chains

237
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:31,519
unfortunately they're also pretty

238
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,879
complicated and and presently a bit

239
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,240
fledgling right we're still a little bit

240
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,320
immature but this graphic does a decent

241
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,320
job of showing how the foundation you

242
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,000
know is the farmers and there can to be

243
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,200
a lot of farmers uh that might support

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,559
you know um a limited amount of

245
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,720
processors which which then go on to

246
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,039
support Brands and consumers and these

247
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,680
Supply chains uh start you know

248
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,319
regionally and then they become

249
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,159
nationally uh and then even

250
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,320
International to some degree for sure as

251
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:02,278
we look at the growing us industry uh

252
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,640
supporting export um but uh but it's

253
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,720
really you know the foundation is is at

254
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:10,000
the farm level and so so why we would

255
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,120
say it's starts on the farm um this is a

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,958
this is one of our Fields here one of

257
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:18,240
our Farmers Dale Flicka this is a a

258
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:20,639
fiber crop um this is an Asian variety I

259
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,120
don't remember which one on the picture

260
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:27,879
probably yma or Hani one of the two um

261
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,799
but um it starts in the farm right and

262
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:34,838
that's the foundation Supply chains so

263
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,639
Agronomy and production is critical um

264
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,160
but it's more than that right it's you

265
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,720
know it's the contracts it's the

266
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,078
relationships it's it's the support So

267
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,560
at IND hemp we' we've actually grown

268
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:49,000
we've contracted for over 30,000 acres

269
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:52,078
to date over the last five years or so

270
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,200
um typically it's about 50% organic um

271
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,239
on our on our grain side of the business

272
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,040
not as much on the on the fiber side

273
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,039
there um and so you know we had a lot of

274
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,199
experience and we've had a lot of

275
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,719
growing pains into what that you know

276
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,120
what that means um to be successful

277
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,320
we're still learning a lot there's still

278
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,440
there's still more to learn um but at

279
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,560
the end of the day you know

280
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,639
fundamentally I I think these These are

281
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:15,239
sort of self truths that everybody

282
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,278
probably knows but just to reiterate

283
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,039
them here there's got to be you know a

284
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,958
market for the farmer right the farmer

285
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,679
needs a buyer and you know and is spot

286
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,838
buying is is difficult and of course we

287
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,479
saw some travesties in the early days of

288
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,240
the Industrial Hemp uh around CBD and

289
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,159
and other uh other Commodities as well

290
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,039
but um the end day the farmers got to

291
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,679
sell their products just like you know

292
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:39,159
everybody else has to sell their their

293
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,638
product so they have to have contracts

294
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:43,240
that are meaningful to them uh and those

295
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,959
contracts really need to you know

296
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,839
encourage some support um the farmers

297
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,399
need a viable production model um and

298
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,600
it's different you know it's different

299
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,360
on where you are and you know what

300
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,240
you're growing for um and it's really

301
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,480
you know I think it's an understated

302
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,039
need for uh the processor the buyer to

303
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,039
help you participant in that support

304
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,919
infrastructure right so uh we have

305
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,639
agronomist on staff I mean I think he

306
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,919
puts like something ridiculous like

307
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:15,079
40,000 miles uh you know windshield time

308
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,479
just D driving around to our Farms you

309
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:18,239
know repeatedly throughout the year

310
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,839
whether that's in the early information

311
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,480
stages of of what our contracts look

312
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,079
like compared to their other

313
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,800
Alternatives um you know to making sure

314
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,919
the seeds are getting planted right and

315
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:33,519
fertilization and and harvesting is a

316
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:36,159
big deal um very challenging I mean um

317
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,560
you know we do both grain and fiber and

318
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,958
we're actually at the point now where we

319
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,518
provide harvesting Services essentially

320
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,958
you know cutting raking and bailing for

321
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,919
the straw uh considering it's 12 feet

322
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:49,799
tall and that was a need that sort of

323
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:52,240
arose out of um you know maybe a lack of

324
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,439
experience with hemp as a fiber crop and

325
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,839
a lack of tools right what are the right

326
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,399
tools and then you you know is one

327
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,720
farmer going to buy that tool it's very

328
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,679
challenging for them to buy a

329
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:06,320
specialized cutter if they're only going

330
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:08,559
to grow 40 or 250 Acres right uh we

331
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,480
leverage what we can from traditional

332
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,679
implements but uh we found is actually

333
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,800
pretty necessary both for having the

334
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,000
right tool for the job then also

335
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,719
managing um the right timing and

336
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,399
practices for the harvesting so um at

337
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,519
any rate Pharmacy a viable production

338
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:24,519
model so they know they can be

339
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,600
successful that they need the right

340
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,240
seeds at the right price this is also I

341
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,440
think an understated uh need for the

342
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,039
industry

343
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,800
um not all seeds are created equal and

344
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,919
some are good in some areas uh climate

345
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,639
and soil conditions and uh some are good

346
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,159
in others and some are good for

347
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,519
obviously for grain applications some

348
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:43,240
are good for fiber applications um and

349
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,039
then some are just too dang expensive to

350
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,839
make the whole model work and so this is

351
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,559
still a need and we've we've identified

352
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,199
a couple that we focus on uh that work

353
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,239
and you know for the most part in those

354
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:56,319
metrics for our models it's going to be

355
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,799
different for everybody in every place

356
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,399
um you know proximity matters um you

357
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,879
know I think this is sort of obvious as

358
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,879
well but um it's most critical for straw

359
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,559
um you know the transportation cost for

360
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,039
straw bills can get expensive grain is a

361
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,319
little more flexible you can move grain

362
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,599
a little bit further um this is the map

363
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,879
of our some of our Farms you know we're

364
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,040
located here in Montana um but we do a

365
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,039
little bit in Idaho Washington and

366
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,480
Oregon as you get further away up to

367
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,719
maybe 400 miles away those are almost

368
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,720
exclusively grain contracts whereas the

369
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,800
straw uh is is quite a bit closer and um

370
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,399
you know I think you you think about

371
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:33,359
traditional Commodities grain elevators

372
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,679
are every County right has a grain

373
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,680
elevator um we're not at that scale yet

374
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,559
but as far as processing infrastructure

375
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,958
you know the transportation costs and

376
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,439
the support system has got to be

377
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,719
Regional in nature um you know for the

378
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,800
farmers but that doesn't not only does

379
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,800
that need to take into account um you

380
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:52,078
know the the farm conditions and the

381
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,319
farm economics and and climates noral

382
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,159
conditions infrastructure all those

383
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,920
things it also needs to consider the

384
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:00,039
regional U markets and hotspot activity

385
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,639
right because there's also a cost to

386
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,278
getting to Market and there's an ease of

387
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:06,240
getting into market so Logistics both

388
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,759
from the farm to a processor but from a

389
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,440
processor to Market all need to be

390
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,879
considered and that may drive decisions

391
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,040
right all of our decisions should really

392
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,120
start at the market level who's buying

393
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,599
something why do they need it you know

394
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,560
what's it what's it look like how much

395
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,120
will that pay and then work that way

396
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:23,799
down the value chain and that actually

397
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,360
has a place at the farm level quality

398
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,599
and cost and and proximity are all

399
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,278
factors

400
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,440
there um if we look at you know out of

401
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:35,120
Agriculture and into that next level of

402
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,920
supply chain uh processing we can look

403
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,399
at it a couple different levels but the

404
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,679
first level is sort of primary

405
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,078
processing primary agricultural

406
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:45,519
processing or first tier processing um

407
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:48,919
here at IND hemp like I said we do both

408
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,278
um fiber and grain uh so these are

409
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:52,198
fairly significant you know

410
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:54,919
infrastructure Investments on the left

411
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:58,159
is the fiber facility um it's about

412
00:15:54,919 --> 00:16:01,120
52,000 Square ft plus about 8 Acres of

413
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,039
outside storage uh for the decortication

414
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,360
the Milling classify and packaging and

415
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:09,159
then on the uh on the grain side uh got

416
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,759
about 177,000 square feet where we have

417
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:15,480
grain cleaning um you know crushing

418
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,480
dehing uh and milling and packaging and

419
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,360
the uh the role here of the first you

420
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,399
know first touch processor obviously is

421
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,079
to take that raw agricultural goods and

422
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,318
and convert them into more of a value

423
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:29,399
added a product that may still be an

424
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:32,078
ingredient um or could be a finished

425
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,480
good you know possibly depending but um

426
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,439
but this is you know this is more

427
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,800
centralized processing with larger

428
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,800
Investments uh to to achieve some scale

429
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,039
um you know there are there are lots of

430
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,120
folks uh at the farm level Farmers that

431
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,480
have invested in Technologies they can

432
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,318
Implement in their uh you know in their

433
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,879
barns or or shops or whatnot and that's

434
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:55,000
just a different style of of processing

435
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,679
and and hopefully there are I think

436
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,600
there are opportunities for that more

437
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:01,838
distributed um processing infrastructure

438
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,640
um to get more value into the farmers

439
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,199
hands but it's always that duality of of

440
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,799
scale you know economics capital

441
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,759
investment and whatnot um you know but

442
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:14,599
we've seen Time and Time Again Farm to

443
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,720
Table being successful uh for hemp it's

444
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:18,798
a you know this is a little bit more

445
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,558
challenging than say for um you know

446
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,038
cattle or something like that where

447
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:26,480
there's a large buyer infrastructure out

448
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:28,480
there of you know of slaughtered meat so

449
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,519
um this is kind of where we landed is is

450
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,798
to centralized processing large scales

451
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:36,319
to do value ad to the raw Goods um and

452
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:40,279
that's because scale matters uh from our

453
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:43,319
perspective to get to those economies um

454
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:44,839
and there's uh generally you know while

455
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,639
uh the industry will beg borrow and

456
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:48,678
steel from other other Industries the

457
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,120
hemp industry will use equipment that

458
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,840
had a different purpose right it might

459
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:54,558
have been for textile processing or it

460
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:57,000
might have been for soy being processing

461
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,839
or whatnot but but almost always these

462
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,558
are purpose-built systems systems that

463
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:04,359
have been you know engineered uh for

464
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,879
hemp whether that means at the systems

465
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:08,678
level where you just put the right

466
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,760
pieces of the puzzle together or you

467
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,840
modified one piece of equipment to do a

468
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:16,319
thing um there's really you know there's

469
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,678
really no not there's not a lot of

470
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,759
success in sort of one you know TurnKey

471
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,159
off the shelf piece of equipment to do

472
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:26,079
what you need it's it really comes down

473
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:27,799
to that systems engineering component um

474
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,879
and uh one thing I think that a lot of

475
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:32,440
people don't consider as much as we

476
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,919
should on the front end of getting into

477
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,480
the processing business is packaging so

478
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,360
one of our goals as as processors in

479
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,720
that intermediary between the farm and

480
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:45,479
the markets to ensure we have adoption

481
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,038
we need to be able to give the market

482
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,640
something that they can use um you know

483
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:51,919
and of course that comes down to the

484
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,159
performance of the material the

485
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,520
compatibility of the manufacturing or or

486
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,559
whatever of that material um but also

487
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:01,879
packaging has a big role in that right I

488
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:04,879
mean if you have a a buyer that's buying

489
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,320
whatever um you know soybean meal or

490
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,520
talc in a certain packaging format and

491
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,879
you're asking him to switch to hemp

492
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,720
that's already one ask if you're asking

493
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,679
him to switch to a different packaging

494
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,798
unit that's another ask um and so that

495
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:23,080
can be challenging too um one we should

496
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:25,599
attempt to minimize the um you know the

497
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,879
hardship on the buyers if they're if

498
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,798
they have to switch from incumbent

499
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,760
material to uh you know to hemp and um

500
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:34,558
that'll just make it easier for us to

501
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,279
you know to get into the market uh one

502
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,639
thing you know in our systems is trying

503
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:40,279
to be automated right how do we uh

504
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,559
minimize the touch points how do we

505
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:46,480
ensure um Quality Control uh and move as

506
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,200
fast as possible because uh that's the

507
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,319
name of the game right uh is uh is

508
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,840
pushing as much material through the

509
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,839
lines as possible to get the cost down

510
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,158
and automation becomes a you know a big

511
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,519
deal for that um and then you know

512
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,240
quality is is as well I mean I think you

513
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:02,960
know quality relates to Performance and

514
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,720
we've got to be competitive with the

515
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,679
other items on the market uh to be you

516
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,798
know uh to be

517
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,000
successful the other piece to this sort

518
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:14,200
of Middle Ground between markets and and

519
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,319
or end markets and consumers and the raw

520
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,319
materials are are con what I'll call

521
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,678
converters which are sort of second tier

522
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:23,558
processors right um so these are these

523
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,120
are groups that might buy you know

524
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:29,119
decorticated fiber from a decortication

525
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:32,519
line they might buy uh you know protein

526
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:35,199
from a seed mill um and the reality is

527
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:37,000
is is these guys need love too um they

528
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,880
need they need Investments they need

529
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,159
reasons to switch to hemp they also need

530
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,000
opportunities as well and um so this can

531
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,480
cover anything from non-woven lines

532
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,519
making uh Felts to feed mills for cattle

533
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,120
or spinning Mills for textiles pulp

534
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:53,240
Mills for paper um food manufacturers

535
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,959
and co-manufacturers composite

536
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,599
manufacturers uh but you know this is

537
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,919
probably not talked about as much as I

538
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,759
think it should should be right is what

539
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,320
are these I mean the reality is we we

540
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,640
might not be able to deliver something

541
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,639
that is a 100% drop in replacement to

542
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,880
the incumbent material so what do these

543
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,520
converters need to do or do we need new

544
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,840
converters that um that maybe a hemp

545
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,960
specific spinning Mill right um because

546
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,599
the challenged all the spinning Mills

547
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,278
out there today have spent 100 years

548
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:23,119
optimizing around short staple cotton or

549
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:26,000
or wool or whatever but it wasn't him

550
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:28,359
right uh so you know do we need new

551
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,159
infrastructure um that can be f focused

552
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:33,199
on him I think it's a it's a valid

553
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,919
question and likely a valid need um but

554
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,159
also there are you know there is

555
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,200
infrastructure out there today that we'd

556
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,240
like to see adopt hemp and so that's the

557
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,120
other piece of that but um they need

558
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,120
investment and they need support as well

559
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,038
and and in many cases those those

560
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,319
companies are interested because they're

561
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:51,119
looking for more market share uh but it

562
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,879
can take time and take a lot of work um

563
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,278
and and these are Giant Markets as well

564
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,640
I mean you know we're talking about

565
00:21:55,278 --> 00:22:00,159
hundreds of billions of dollars for

566
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:03,159
these products not that hemp would have

567
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,320
um you know you billions of dollars

568
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,440
opportunity I think some people might

569
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,158
say it would but um but the point is

570
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,679
just that there's a lot of space and

571
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,240
there's a lot of prerogatives that are

572
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,759
happening now that are you know are

573
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,440
driving the desire whether it's for more

574
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:18,158
sustainable materials um but I think one

575
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,640
of the goals is to try to find the

576
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,240
places you know where there is growth

577
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,159
like what what Market is growing because

578
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,159
it's easier to penetrate a a growing

579
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,320
market and sort of feed off the growth

580
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,640
rather than a declining or stagnant

581
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:35,079
Market um where you're you know a true

582
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,038
replacement to you know to existing um

583
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:39,879
materials and

584
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,519
infrastructure so um that brings up some

585
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,520
questions about you know how do you how

586
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,240
do you go to market I think in that in

587
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,639
that supply chain and what are the

588
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,960
markets and so one thing I think that we

589
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,120
found that was successful is to look at

590
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:56,159
vertical in integration um often time

591
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:58,678
that's needs a supply chain partner uh

592
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,240
to get that over the the goal line

593
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,240
um whether that's through contract

594
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,120
manufacturing you know to um you know to

595
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,960
make um a salad dressing or whatever out

596
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:12,119
of your you know your hemp oil or

597
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:14,679
whatnot um or a non-woven mat um for

598
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,719
erosion control whatever it might be

599
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,559
lots of times we can't do all that

600
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,519
inhouse sometimes we can um you know and

601
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,519
and that could be a finished branded

602
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,400
product uh which is what we've done in

603
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,798
some cases is is develop you know in

604
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,400
consumer products primar in the animal

605
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,319
space it's a place where we found

606
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,080
success um whether that's through

607
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:39,158
bedding or nutritional and supplement

608
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:41,759
products um but you know the the uh sort

609
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:44,080
of the benefit of doing that is is

610
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,919
balancing that sort of that lower margin

611
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,798
large scale B2B adoption with higher

612
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,880
margin you know you know finished

613
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:54,918
products but with that is a whole

614
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,480
another level of of um operational needs

615
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:59,600
for the company to uh to integrate and

616
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,759
and for us us both are critical I mean

617
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,519
the sort of that large scale B2B uh bulk

618
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:07,278
sales are necessary to achieve the

619
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:08,879
economies of scale um you know so that

620
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,079
we can actually make the stuff at an

621
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,039
affordable price but then the finished

622
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:15,720
goods enable us to capture some more of

623
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,400
the margin but but um but we actually

624
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,278
needed Partners to do that so we we

625
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,120
launched in that space with a local

626
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:25,440
retailer in uh in Montana and Idaho

627
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:28,798
called North 40 and so they kind of

628
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,919
helped direct us on what a brand might

629
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,679
look like and and what are the packaging

630
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:35,559
units on the store shelves what are some

631
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,080
of the other uh opportunities uh or

632
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:39,960
other options out there that we'd have

633
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,759
an opportunity to support or replace um

634
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,919
so that customer buying was extremely

635
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,960
critical that customer Discovery and us

636
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,600
making decisions to you know to launch

637
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,840
our you s our first branded product and

638
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:53,199
since then we've learned a lot and we

639
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,759
we've grown uh you know beyond that but

640
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,278
uh but having that partner on the front

641
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,119
end uh was really critical so it's

642
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,599
definitely something we found successful

643
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,798
I think everybody else would and that

644
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,519
that sort of led to us developing two

645
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:08,119
different uh branded lines we have a

646
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:12,599
farm and ranch line called himana and

647
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:14,519
then a a pet line called all walks um

648
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:16,079
and so that way we we have different you

649
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:19,278
know similar products different

650
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,798
packaging formats or sizes uh different

651
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:24,119
you know different markets pet would go

652
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:26,440
into specialty pet stores like a Petco

653
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,239
or petmart farmer Ranch into Tractor

654
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Supply type stores

655
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,960
um but the other thing that kind of came

656
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,679
along with this is um you know this

657
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,720
required us to obviously invest in

658
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,120
packaging infrastructure but also brand

659
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,798
and marketing as well and then you know

660
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,079
that should be understated and so one of

661
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,879
the things we also do is we utilize that

662
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,599
infrastructure and that knowhow to do

663
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,760
private label for others um you know so

664
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,480
that's a way to diversify some of our

665
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,158
you know our operational needs and

666
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,278
revenue opportunities and support other

667
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,159
companies uh in the process as well to

668
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,079
get their brands out there or support

669
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:02,159
their region and um you know we can't

670
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:03,480
really do it all ourselves right and so

671
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,320
you know I think in the future we'll see

672
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,240
more distributed manufacturing come

673
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,960
online

674
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,359
um you know so I like talk a little bit

675
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,000
um uh about Farm you know what do we

676
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,839
really think we can achieve here in the

677
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,398
in the hemp industry what that means and

678
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:23,720
and how we get there um so one thing I

679
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:27,798
think is is worth sort of uh mentioning

680
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:30,880
here is uh you know the countries that

681
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:32,519
have uh the larger hemp cropping acreage

682
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,440
um for one they either neither they

683
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:37,119
didn't ban production or they restarted

684
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,640
earlier and so China um never having ban

685
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:42,319
production you know they're looking at

686
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,080
this is data from 2020 uh but it's not

687
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:48,158
terribly different in

688
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:51,038
20122 um but China in the 160,000 acre

689
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,240
range uh France and Canada they

690
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:56,079
restarted earlier France in the 1960s

691
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,319
and Canada in the late 90s of of

692
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:01,278
reinvigorate their their hemp

693
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,599
um you know their hemp opportunity and I

694
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,599
think that's sort of telling right I

695
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:08,278
mean France started in the 60s and

696
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:13,719
they're looking at 46,000 Acres Canada

697
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:17,720
late 90s and 55,000 Acres so um you know

698
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:21,558
20 25 years I mean uh 60 years these are

699
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:24,038
long time frames to get to what arguably

700
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,678
in the scale of agricultural Commodities

701
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:28,480
isn't that many acres right and so I

702
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:31,679
think there's some question out in front

703
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,759
of us um you know as we as we look at

704
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,038
this data is well what how can we do it

705
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,158
faster how can we do it better how can

706
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:40,960
we do more right how do we how do we get

707
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,278
more value more demand for hemp um and

708
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,319
in order to do that it's kind of

709
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:46,558
necessary that we look at some of the

710
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,960
other Supply chains that were built and

711
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,278
figure out what we can learn from them

712
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,679
um and they're complicated right so I

713
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,679
mean it it covers an enormous amount

714
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,278
this for for a new industry like hemp

715
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,320
you know an enormous amount of touch

716
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,919
points right and uh whether that's um at

717
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,079
the farm level the processor specialized

718
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:09,320
equipment um Logistics you know there

719
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,918
storage I mean R&amp;D genetics I mean it's

720
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:13,720
just it's a very complicated industry

721
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,559
that really needs coordination and it

722
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,720
also needs Capital at at different

723
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:21,278
stages um of the supply

724
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,159
chain and so we you know we think about

725
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,919
that say okay well it's complicated

726
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,039
there's a lot of moving you know factors

727
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,080
a lot of different places how do we

728
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,398
exped

729
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:33,240
success and reduce that investment cost

730
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:35,199
um I think it's impaired that we look at

731
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,839
other countries and we look at other

732
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,759
agricultural Commodities and so um this

733
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,480
is actually what the report that Pierre

734
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,079
put out there did a good job of spelling

735
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,038
out so um the next few slides here I'll

736
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,278
kind of uh grab some stuff from from him

737
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:49,759
um make sure I give him a shout out

738
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:51,798
there but I think they're it's really

739
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,119
good information that uh not everybody's

740
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:57,398
aware of um so we'll start with France

741
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,558
so um like I said France started in the

742
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:02,278
60s you know they're at 50,000 Acres or

743
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:04,519
so about you know now um and they

744
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:07,398
probably have the most Diversified

745
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:10,480
industrial value chains as Rel to

746
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:12,599
products and and markets um in the world

747
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,038
um China you know almost exclusively

748
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:18,678
textiles right Canada almost exclusively

749
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:21,679
uh grain and food whereas France has a

750
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:23,480
lot more diversity but it took 50 years

751
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,120
for them to get there and I can tell you

752
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,000
um in spending some time with one of the

753
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:30,879
larger processes over there um it took

754
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,319
them 18 years to get to break even and

755
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,278
those are pretty sobering you know

756
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,278
sobering remarks I think that we should

757
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:37,759
all consider and so how do we learn from

758
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:40,480
that you know how do we how do we

759
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:43,038
accelerate it because um you know we

760
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,919
might not have the appetite uh you know

761
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:48,759
or the ability to uh to last that long

762
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,759
for some of us um so one of the things

763
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:54,319
in France is uh they had cooperatives

764
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,759
every pretty much every uh hemp uh

765
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,038
industry member in France is part of a a

766
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,558
cooperative

767
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,319
um and that ensured farmer buying in The

768
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:03,960
Prudent Progressive development to

769
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:05,960
create value to the farmers right if it

770
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,919
doesn't work for the farm doesn't work

771
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,038
for everybody it doesn't work for

772
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,320
anybody right um but Farmers have a lot

773
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:13,359
of other options right they have a lot

774
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,599
of other things they can grow so and

775
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,240
that's the foundation that we have to

776
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:19,319
build on so having their buying at the

777
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,399
beginning uh is is extremely useful in

778
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:25,359
ensuring that we have a suable and

779
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:27,839
stable and sustainable supply chain um

780
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:31,439
furthermore several groups of processors

781
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:33,278
came together to pull resources um you

782
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,519
know and to invest in activities and

783
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:36,278
sometimes that was with external

784
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,720
Partners but they sort of aligned and

785
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:40,960
said hey like we all got some of the

786
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,558
same problems um maybe we should work

787
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,120
together on those we all have some of

788
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,200
the same opportunities you know maybe we

789
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:47,558
should work together on those um and

790
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,640
that's difficult right that's a

791
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:51,359
challenge uh I think for us to let our

792
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,600
guards down but it could be one of the

793
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,798
most instrumental ways we can be

794
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,879
successful uh they're also booed by

795
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:00,519
favorable government relations or

796
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:04,000
regulations um you know in France and in

797
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:05,839
the European Union at large in time um

798
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,919
and uh that allowed the industry to

799
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:11,079
expand and uh one thing that is is kind

800
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:12,960
of Cornerstone um in Europe and

801
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:15,918
specifically in France are subsidies for

802
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,480
hemp turns out they get about you know

803
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,720
anywhere from 60 to $76 per acre in

804
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,599
subsidies for growing hemp split between

805
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,558
two different subsidy programs um that's

806
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,000
pretty significant I mean that's that's

807
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,638
essentially

808
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,599
um the bottom line the the profit margin

809
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:34,918
uh for a farmer um so it's very

810
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,759
meaningful and you know we obviously

811
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,120
don't have that and we may never have

812
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,079
that uh in the US but regardless it's

813
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,798
good to understand what some of those

814
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,480
levers were in other places and how they

815
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,398
are

816
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,480
successful we should also look at other

817
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:51,558
agricultural Commodities you know in in

818
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,880
the United States and and North America

819
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:55,879
sort of three that sort of stand out in

820
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,320
the uh the last century for growth are

821
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,000
cotton sugar beats and soybeans as

822
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:04,158
potential models um for how we can build

823
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
you know our supply chain um cotton

824
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,200
arguably you know was was the most

825
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,038
successful in garnering um government or

826
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,440
Congressional uh support um and that was

827
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:17,278
in large part uh function of cotton be

828
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,840
the go-to fiber um you know in the early

829
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,558
part of the 19 20th century and then

830
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,079
synthetic fibers coming around the mid

831
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:27,319
part of the century uh displacing

832
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,319
enormous market share for cotton and the

833
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:30,720
saying oh boy this is a bit of a problem

834
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:32,200
we got a lot of farmers growing cotton

835
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,798
we got a lot of infrastruct

836
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,919
infrastructure um dedicated to it and so

837
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:39,918
um you know an Act was actually uh

838
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,360
passed to support cotton research and

839
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,679
promotion then cotton Inc came on board

840
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:48,558
um with really a dual strategy to to get

841
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,840
that market share back by both pushing

842
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,918
Innovations um through by supporting

843
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:56,000
research and development um but then

844
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:58,480
also uh building customer Demand by

845
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,240
advertising you know pulling through so

846
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,919
you've seen the you seen the cot logo

847
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,679
I'm sure in placees not not so

848
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,919
dissimilar to to got milk or um where's

849
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,679
the beef type of campaigns uh in the

850
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,480
past right so uh sugar beats is another

851
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:16,320
example where Farmers banded together in

852
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,798
associations and and cooperatives um and

853
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:22,638
that enabled them to share a lot of the

854
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:24,558
lessons learn uh to pull um you know the

855
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:26,678
uh the processing infrastructure I mean

856
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,599
most they're almost all cooperatives and

857
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,038
then the Cooperators join together in a

858
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:33,599
Cooperative uh to form you know United

859
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:36,359
sugar and whatnot um you so they achiev

860
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:40,519
some stability there and their ability

861
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:42,839
to um present a more unified um source

862
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:46,200
of Supply you know and saying well we're

863
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:48,079
not just one company we're we're a um

864
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,360
you know an association of of members

865
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,798
that retain their own ownership but come

866
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:55,879
together um to Market our products kind

867
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:59,200
of collectively into the space so that

868
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,600
um big you know big users big buyers of

869
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,080
sugar can see sugar beats as a solution

870
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:07,278
for large market share um soybean is

871
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:10,000
another that took 50 years to become

872
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:12,280
firmly established uh in the United

873
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,440
States um and a lot of that is is

874
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,800
credited to you know two Federated U

875
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,559
entities the United soy board and the

876
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,679
American soybean Association that were

877
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:25,519
able to look at their membership's needs

878
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,679
find uh find dollars to support that um

879
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,679
obviously we see the ad of check offs um

880
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,960
and what not at the farm level but there

881
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:36,320
again that has bred innovation in in

882
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,480
developing new products from soy and soy

883
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,119
oil and soy meal um in understanding you

884
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,079
know the nutritional value of meal um

885
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:45,879
you know all that you know Cooperative

886
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,159
working together for the benefit of the

887
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:48,960
entire industry um really showed a lot

888
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,200
of

889
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,358
success so we started to still some of

890
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:56,598
that down into some lessons learned for

891
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:58,199
our our supply chain um you know based

892
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:59,480
on those other learnings that

893
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:01,159
representative associations were

894
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,400
critical whether that was in France for

895
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,960
hemp or these other ADI in the US um

896
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,680
federating the farmers and the growers

897
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,920
association seems have been a very

898
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:12,919
successful uh methodology as well to uh

899
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,519
help stabilize the growing region you

900
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,159
know you diversify um you know the uh

901
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:20,960
the supply chain for more than one

902
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:23,199
farmer but everybody working together to

903
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,000
ensure um you know that there is a

904
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,439
supply and the quality of that supply

905
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,280
and even sharing the cost of some of the

906
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,519
implements or Investments and equipment

907
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,480
to get that done um and then

908
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,358
coordinating farmers and processors from

909
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,199
research and development from

910
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:39,078
universities and private firms right um

911
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,919
so there again not working in a bubble

912
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:43,079
right okay what is Meaningful to to

913
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,760
Farmers and I think you heard from David

914
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:47,320
shuch a lot of the research happening

915
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,839
there we're involved in a program to

916
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:54,039
look at microbial activity to boost

917
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:56,318
reading on hyraw uh and that's a place

918
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:58,318
where industry and Farmers stand to gain

919
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:59,838
a lot but we need universities to do

920
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:01,079
that you know a lot of that

921
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,559
groundbreaking

922
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:05,480
work uh generating political support the

923
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:07,480
state and federal levels um that's sort

924
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,199
of going hit and miss you know so far in

925
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,358
the United States and and we um we have

926
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:14,838
a lot of diversity in our goals a lot of

927
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:16,400
diversity in our you know large large

928
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:19,519
country and the needs in any different

929
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,838
region in um we need that support

930
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,880
collection aggregation in Sharing to

931
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:24,960
enable traceability and efficiency so

932
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,039
this is something obviously the cotton

933
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,280
industry did really well um really USDA

934
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:33,559
did really well right is they developed

935
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,920
grading schemes they collected data uh

936
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:37,679
on the on the quality of the of the

937
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,119
cotton and they developed the

938
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,239
methodology to and you know for

939
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:43,519
standardization and specifications and

940
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,039
then they developed the traceability

941
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,800
program so that every cotton bail you

942
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:51,759
know has a has a tag and it's traceable

943
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,560
right big undertaking took support of

944
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,880
the federal government uh we're not

945
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:56,440
likely to get that kind of support soon

946
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,920
but things we should be thinking about

947
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,200
right and then of course strategic

948
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,280
alliances with Industries we'll be

949
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,318
looking for pool like what is what do

950
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,839
existing Industries need and how can we

951
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:07,000
service

952
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:10,519
them um if you look at the uh the

953
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,280
industry right now the hemp industry um

954
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:14,679
there's there's some challenges there I

955
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:18,680
I actually we just did a a quick math on

956
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:20,519
this um right now we know of about 39

957
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:23,519
you know decortication companies you

958
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:26,280
know primary straw processors um and

959
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:29,079
they all have different scale different

960
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:32,079
equipment different regions um different

961
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:33,880
products different specifications and

962
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,680
it's and it's a challenge because

963
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,358
they're kind of all 39 of them out there

964
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:40,199
talking to a lot of the same people a

965
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:43,279
lot of the same same customers um and so

966
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,519
while you know um a robust supply chain

967
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,040
that isn't dependent on any one uh any

968
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:52,280
one player is critical um to show that

969
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:54,960
we can scale um that's a lot of Talking

970
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,599
Heads out there um you know talking to

971
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,318
the customer base and potentially confus

972
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:03,480
fusing them or or um you know possibly

973
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:04,800
stealing customer base so um you know

974
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,599
and because of that there's minimal

975
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,039
continuity and there's no stand you know

976
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:10,599
no real standard specification we had a

977
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:14,239
little bit of success lately um you know

978
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:15,800
inm and in some building codes codes but

979
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,239
uh we got some you know some more work

980
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,400
to do there and so this you know this is

981
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,919
all sort of come back to that

982
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:25,000
coordinating the the value chain right I

983
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,000
mean quality matters but it matters you

984
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,679
know to the customer right I mean if

985
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,318
we're not you know producing something

986
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,879
that somebody wants to buy that's that's

987
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:35,239
a problem um because at the end of the

988
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,440
day you we can talk about hemp we can

989
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,838
talk about sustainability but the the

990
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,159
first two metrics are price and

991
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:43,719
performance right and and if we can if

992
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:45,799
we can be competitive in price and

993
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,399
performance hemp's going to win almost

994
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,720
every time on

995
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,000
sustainability um you know and and the

996
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:54,598
other marketing attributes um but in

997
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,800
order to to solve some of these problems

998
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,599
we got to work together to do that and I

999
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,359
think it's understanding that uh how to

1000
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:02,640
work in that supply chain is important

1001
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:05,358
we start by first we have to understand

1002
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:08,199
that value chain um then we need to work

1003
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:10,078
on optimizing it and then we can grow it

1004
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:13,399
and then we can increase its complexity

1005
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,000
right I I kudos to those folks out there

1006
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,318
you know trying to work on graphing from

1007
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,199
hemp but like um maybe there's some

1008
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:21,440
lower hanging fruit out there right and

1009
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,879
so um we're going to need those things

1010
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,639
there's no doubt about it but sort of

1011
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,920
focusing on basic products and then

1012
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,838
moving into more value ad and highly

1013
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,159
technical attributes is a bit of a road

1014
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:33,519
map that we've been uh trying to you

1015
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:35,199
know trying to work on focusing on ready

1016
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:36,719
customers are they importing it from out

1017
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:38,480
of the country like let's start there

1018
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:41,159
right just change their supply chain

1019
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,199
from International you know to domestic

1020
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:45,759
um and let's work on characterizing that

1021
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,639
that production and uh and the raw

1022
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,119
material and then we can increase it and

1023
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:52,199
we can improve it so I think a stairstep

1024
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:54,318
approach to Growing this supply chain

1025
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:57,279
together is probably more likely to be

1026
00:39:54,318 --> 00:40:00,480
successful so we need to find value

1027
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,960
right um for hemp and starting easy you

1028
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,760
know start easy what's that low hanging

1029
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,000
fruit I mean I hate to be cheeky but you

1030
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,440
know animals pee on bedding it's not

1031
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,880
that complicated right um we can move on

1032
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,400
to more complicated things you know we

1033
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,680
are a really strong advocates for hemp

1034
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,480
as a food um but it's a difficult cell I

1035
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,078
mean I I don't even know how to

1036
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,760
pronounce half these words up here right

1037
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:23,880
now albumin and globulin um they're not

1038
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,920
in my frozen pizza I'm pretty sure so

1039
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,119
you know there's a lot of work to do to

1040
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,920
educate

1041
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,519
uh the the consumers and the food

1042
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,358
manufacturers out there about about how

1043
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,318
powerful these uh these ingredients can

1044
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:38,679
be but it's more complicated and it

1045
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:40,880
takes more time right and so I think we

1046
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:43,440
have to have this balanced approach of

1047
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,358
loow hanging fruit and then an eye to

1048
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,159
the future you know in more complicated

1049
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:50,358
uh opportunities for

1050
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,078
him because I guess it's a bit of a soak

1051
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:56,679
box right you here you can do 10,000

1052
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:59,839
usages uh for hemp but um you know what

1053
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:01,838
are the 100 that'll make money that's

1054
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:03,759
the bottom line right I mean like in

1055
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,000
order to have sustainable business

1056
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,400
models we have to have you know

1057
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,159
profitability and so this is a you know

1058
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,800
really great map that sort of breaks

1059
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,759
down um entry-level project you know

1060
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,400
products to more complicated strategic

1061
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,520
initiatives and beginning to understand

1062
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,639
this as an industry will help us chart

1063
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:25,239
our path um you know through and

1064
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:28,318
prioritize uh what we do uh in the value

1065
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:30,439
chain these are long games um you know

1066
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,400
it's we having some really good success

1067
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,760
here recently it looks like hemp seed

1068
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,280
meal for laying hins is about to be

1069
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,040
approved by afo in the United States

1070
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,880
it's a big deal and it has taken three

1071
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:44,559
years to get to this point and a lot of

1072
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,720
people working on it right you can feed

1073
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:50,159
hemp to your your babies but you can't

1074
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:52,799
feed it to your chickens or your cattle

1075
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,799
um so the the long game is important but

1076
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,079
dedicating resources to that can be

1077
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,000
challenging and even when we participate

1078
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:01,440
in that we really have to understand um

1079
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,719
you know what is it what what does it

1080
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,720
mean for the industry right what problem

1081
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:08,919
are we trying to solve be that in the

1082
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:11,118
nutritional profile for chicken or in

1083
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,920
the co-product utilization at the

1084
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,358
processor level right I've got a lot of

1085
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,440
demand for hempseed oil I need to find a

1086
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,039
place for the meal um so all these

1087
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,280
things have to go hand inand as we look

1088
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:23,719
at the market in the supply chain to

1089
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,839
ensure that we've got uh opportunities

1090
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:28,118
for you know all of the fractions are

1091
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,480
stram that come off of the uh off the

1092
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:33,119
farm and off of the processor uh we also

1093
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,599
need to reduce barriers right for for

1094
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:41,480
Growers um for processors and um you

1095
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:44,039
know the idea that we still have to get

1096
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,280
um background checks for our Farmers to

1097
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,000
grow industrial hemp is can be a

1098
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,200
challenge getting Farmers to grow for us

1099
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,159
so the industrial hemp Act is an

1100
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:54,039
opportunity um I encourage you guys to

1101
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:56,598
take a look at this uh WR your

1102
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:57,960
congressman and whatnot um but changing

1103
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:59,359
the regulations a little bit to be a

1104
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,559
little bit more friendly for grain and

1105
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,279
fiber because if you've ever seen a

1106
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:05,000
fiber field it's pretty clear they're

1107
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,200
not growing marijuana in there right I

1108
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:12,599
mean you can tell at a glance that that

1109
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:13,879
is not um you know not a THC crop um so

1110
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:15,240
there's a lot of opportunities there as

1111
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,400
we look at now more into the

1112
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:21,000
optimization stage this is just this is

1113
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,240
just one of those opportunities so um

1114
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,400
the future's wide open you know I think

1115
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:26,479
uh I think you know what I'm talking

1116
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,680
about here just sort of ways to help us

1117
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,838
chart the path but the opportunity is is

1118
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:32,799
a bit endless and I think we all have an

1119
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:34,759
opportunity to write our own stories we

1120
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,280
just we should do that together and

1121
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,800
learn lessons uh where we can as we go

1122
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,400
and we'll head off into the sunset so um

1123
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,880
that's about it uh for my talk I'll see

1124
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:49,880
if I can figure out how to answer some

1125
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,880
questions

1126
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,318
um okay so first question here um 50% of

1127
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,358
their Farmers produce organic seeds what

1128
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:00,519
are some application differences in

1129
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:03,039
product for organic seeds and

1130
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:06,639
non-organic seeds yeah it's a good

1131
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,838
question um so just to be clear um you

1132
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:10,519
know we would typically refer to this as

1133
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:12,558
grain versus planting seeds so yeah

1134
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:15,800
about 50% of our farm activity in the

1135
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:18,040
past has been for organic grain it does

1136
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,839
turn out that that straw is certified

1137
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:23,480
organic as well um and our facilities

1138
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:25,078
are certified organic so our our uh

1139
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,358
grain cleaning and crushing facilities

1140
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:30,240
certified organic our fiber processing

1141
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:33,039
plant so uh we can sell the residual

1142
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,358
straw organic fiber from there but to

1143
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,279
but to your question the applications

1144
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:39,598
aren't terribly different per se um it's

1145
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,519
just a matter of whether or not that uh

1146
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,960
that that product that brand wants

1147
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:48,358
organic um or not uh so for instance we

1148
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,519
have a a buyer of hemp seed oil that

1149
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:52,920
makes condiments they're not concerned

1150
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:54,838
about it being organic however we have

1151
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,760
another buyer of hemp seed oil that

1152
00:44:54,838 --> 00:45:00,440
makes soaps they do want it to be

1153
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,240
organic um so it's it's really more of

1154
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,039
that prerogative and what market share

1155
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,959
they're going after

1156
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:09,440
functionally the uh the product is

1157
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,000
basically the same right whether that's

1158
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,960
um a meal for the the the hip seed meal

1159
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,760
for the chickens organic not- Organics

1160
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,920
just does the brand really want

1161
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,839
organic who is the current direct

1162
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,119
consumer how much are change over would

1163
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:27,880
him be as a coin corn soybean

1164
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,880
farmer um

1165
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:34,160
so the change from like an incumbent

1166
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,599
farming practice um you know I I like to

1167
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,399
say that like um for for like fiber you

1168
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,480
plant on a grain model and you you

1169
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,280
harvest on a hay model that's probably

1170
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,318
where most of the um most of the

1171
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,319
differences are going to happen is going

1172
00:45:45,318 --> 00:45:50,719
to be in a in a fiber crop the grain

1173
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:52,880
crops are pretty similar um to soybean I

1174
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:55,358
mean your fertilization even isn't that

1175
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,519
much different you're using seed drills

1176
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:59,598
um you're using combines grain dryers

1177
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,880
cleaners on the grain side it's it's

1178
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,160
more of a drop in it's more about you

1179
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,800
know what are the settings on the

1180
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:08,639
combine and um you know what's your

1181
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,680
favorite color red or green combine and

1182
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,920
and what you know what changes do you

1183
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:13,598
maybe have to make so that you don't

1184
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,519
have tangling of the fiber there's

1185
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,920
nuances there but uh but it's pretty

1186
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:20,559
pretty darn similar on the grain um the

1187
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,039
fiber more challenging where we have to

1188
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:23,040
look at more specialized harvesting

1189
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:24,838
equipment and so that's what I was

1190
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,119
talking about earlier about you know

1191
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:31,039
maybe a processor invest in those or

1192
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:33,838
Growers associations invest in those um

1193
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:36,838
the direct consumer of I guess of a

1194
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,920
mid-tier processor Like Us in some cases

1195
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:41,279
is uh retailers and Distributors for our

1196
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:45,200
branded products that go on shelves or

1197
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,079
on Amazon direct to Consumer um or uh

1198
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:48,719
and the bulk of it is B2B you know we're

1199
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:51,760
selling to converters like a non-woven

1200
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,759
line or something like

1201
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,559
that um do all your H Farmers that grow

1202
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,000
for Grandin have drying equipment on the

1203
00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:00,480
farm Farm is a requirement for IND hemp

1204
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,318
grain farm so um they don't have grain

1205
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:07,039
dryer so Montana is pretty dry but they

1206
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:09,199
they do have like live bins um so that

1207
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:10,759
uh we can put air not not all of them

1208
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,558
most of them have have bins with

1209
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,119
airation in them where they can dry it

1210
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:18,720
down in the bin uh what we do ask them

1211
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,680
to do is is pre- clean um so before they

1212
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:24,279
put it in the bin to get rid of a lot of

1213
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:28,239
that chaff that's still in there um yeah

1214
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:30,519
full floor Iration uh thanks doton um

1215
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:31,879
but um but what really helps is to get

1216
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:33,838
rid of a lot of that chaff so that

1217
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,079
there's not as much moisture going into

1218
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:37,358
the bin so we do ask our Farmers lots of

1219
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,359
times to do a pre- cleaning with like a

1220
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:45,639
trumel type of a

1221
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:47,799
device um yeah Henry Ford and soybeans

1222
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:50,519
um do you know if the new Farm Bill

1223
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:53,760
addressing Industrial Hemp issues um yes

1224
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:57,719
it will I don't know exactly what those

1225
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,720
will be um so stay tuned how do you

1226
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:02,598
suppose dispose of the Dust In Your Dust

1227
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:04,519
collection systems Tom Keane hey buddy

1228
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:07,440
man good to good to see you're still out

1229
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:08,880
there in the hemp space Tom's uh I I'm

1230
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,079
just give a shout out to Tom here

1231
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,559
because uh Kentucky really led the

1232
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:15,519
charge in the early years one of the

1233
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:18,760
things that most states are missing is

1234
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:21,639
support um from their extension services

1235
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,000
right uh which all Farmers utilize so um

1236
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:25,799
I don't I don't know what up to these

1237
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,280
days Tom but Tom was the Kentucky h

1238
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,960
specialist for the extension uh services

1239
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,200
so um but uh at any rate to answer your

1240
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,000
question uh we're trying to find markets

1241
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,598
for the Dust for sure and we've got some

1242
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,239
things out there um today we typically

1243
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,240
just turn it back into the soil to

1244
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:43,639
provide some nutritional value to our

1245
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:45,919
Farmers um so we we take it out you know

1246
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:48,519
in a dump truck and spread it on a field

1247
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,920
um we have quite a few uh value added

1248
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:54,440
opportunities we're working on composite

1249
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:56,358
space um lawn and garden space um

1250
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,519
erosion control

1251
00:48:56,358 --> 00:48:59,519
they haven't quite hit

1252
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:05,359
yet what size field do we have to grow

1253
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:09,199
to make it worth it that is dependent on

1254
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:11,400
you know your farm operation right um

1255
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:13,439
you know I think you know in the in the

1256
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,880
old days like it's something like CBD

1257
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:19,599
we're talking much smaller Acres more of

1258
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:21,920
a tobacco T type of model um these days

1259
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,519
you know with grain and fiber uh we

1260
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,318
typically don't do anything our Farmers

1261
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:28,280
don't do anything less than 40 acres um

1262
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:31,400
Ian it probably makes the most sense in

1263
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,400
the 100 to 200 acre range they grow

1264
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,960
thousands of Acres though which maybe is

1265
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,039
different than other parts of the

1266
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,920
country where a farmer might grow

1267
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:42,159
average like 500 Acres um our Farms can

1268
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,318
be as much as 40,000 Acres out here in

1269
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:47,679
Montana um more typically in the 10,000

1270
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:47,679
acre

1271
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:56,239
range um thanks

1272
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:58,559
Vanessa for your your uh compliment

1273
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:01,358
um okay

1274
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:05,200
so this might be question beyond your

1275
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:08,558
presentation agronomics um like to know

1276
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:09,838
whether there's any sort of audio alepoy

1277
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,040
with hemp I don't even know if I said

1278
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:16,119
that word right um can we grow hemp in a

1279
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:19,079
farm continuously or should we rotate it

1280
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:21,440
um we are definitely not Advocates of of

1281
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:23,200
monocropping uh with hemp I don't know

1282
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,760
that there's any good studies out there

1283
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:30,358
other than the you know sort of generic

1284
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:32,520
disease cycle breaking um types of of of

1285
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:34,239
components um I'm not the expert on that

1286
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:35,358
but we definitely encourage rotational

1287
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,358
crops we think that's better for the

1288
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:39,039
farmer it's better for the soil you know

1289
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:42,078
they can diversify their

1290
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:44,400
portfolio um also hemp has a long taper

1291
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,318
it and so an hour neck of the woods

1292
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,039
sometimes it can be useful to break up

1293
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,279
some of that hardpacked soil and so it's

1294
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:53,079
useful to to rotate it around for that

1295
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:57,440
as well um so I'm not the expert on that

1296
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:57,440
but we definitely recommend uh

1297
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,558
rotating what do you believe is the

1298
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:04,480
biggest barried entry and how to

1299
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:06,760
overcome that so um it's going to depend

1300
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:10,000
a little bit on you know what vertical

1301
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,760
we might be talking about uh and then

1302
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,079
you know what uh what's been happening

1303
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,240
in your region right if you've got um it

1304
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,400
can start with just getting seed uh can

1305
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:20,598
be a can be a barrier entry but if you

1306
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,720
sort of gotten beyond that and you're

1307
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:24,920
starting to look at uh you know how do I

1308
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:27,598
make a successful business um one of the

1309
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:30,680
challenges we see right now is hemp

1310
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,880
foods are not growing very fast I mean

1311
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:37,039
we kind of hit Peak hemp heart in a

1312
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:39,400
sense um so you know most consumers that

1313
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:42,400
that that know about hemp Foods or

1314
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,920
eating hemp Foods in the current format

1315
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,000
um so I think you know that's that's a

1316
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,240
challenge on the on the food side of the

1317
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,440
business um is finding you know is

1318
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,598
finding markets there um the export

1319
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,358
opportunity is growing I would say in

1320
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:59,559
that case um so I think on the on the

1321
00:51:56,358 --> 00:52:01,558
oil seed side uh it starts with you know

1322
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:04,319
what are those markets and and how do I

1323
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:05,960
address them um on the fiber side you

1324
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:09,039
know there's a lot of Market opportunity

1325
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:11,639
those are growing pretty rapidly um you

1326
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:13,920
know what I've seen in the industry is

1327
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:16,318
is is capital being one of the biggest

1328
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,119
challenges uh to be able to you know to

1329
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:21,318
kind of get up and running uh to do that

1330
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,440
and um because it's you sort of need a

1331
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:25,880
walk crawl run right it's hard to invest

1332
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,880
in large scale infrastructure if you

1333
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,358
don't have some successful operating

1334
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,480
supply chain and it's easier to get a

1335
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:34,279
supply chain going at a smaller scale

1336
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,400
but you can't provide Goods at a

1337
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,240
competitive price um so you know so

1338
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,920
there's some challenges there so it kind

1339
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,639
of depends on you know where you're

1340
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,639
where you're at in the supply chain if

1341
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:46,519
you're at the farm level harvesting

1342
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:49,440
equipment might be a big uh challenge

1343
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:51,559
for you to supply fiber if you're in uh

1344
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,599
if you want to be a processor then

1345
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:56,400
getting the capital to scale may be one

1346
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,240
of the challenges um so it depends you

1347
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,200
know it depends but but in all cases

1348
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:04,598
almost all cases at this point you know

1349
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:08,039
hemp is is replacing something else

1350
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:10,240
right and so um that can be a challenge

1351
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:13,000
you know uh new opportunities for hemp

1352
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:15,759
holy new are a little bit more difficult

1353
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,358
so finding the those easy wins is is

1354
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,359
critical I

1355
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:24,159
think please talk about the unique

1356
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:25,640
aspects of hemp supply chain branches as

1357
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,159
they relate to seed fire building

1358
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:30,960
materials and flour uh yeah Dave you

1359
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:33,519
know it's a good point um we're really

1360
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:36,280
big advocates for the uh for dual you

1361
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:40,679
know dual cropping Dual

1362
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:42,599
Purpose excuse me um and so you know uh

1363
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:44,039
if you grow for grain you still have a

1364
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:46,200
stalk out in the field and there are

1365
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:49,798
some genetics that are more optimized to

1366
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:52,358
have more stalk or more grain or whatnot

1367
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:54,639
um but uh you know you can harvest the

1368
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:58,318
Grain and then you can harvest the uh

1369
00:53:54,639 --> 00:54:00,358
the straw as well and uh the you know so

1370
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,159
so as a plant you know that sort of

1371
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:04,440
whole plant utilization is really

1372
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:06,039
powerful particularly at the farm level

1373
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,440
because the farmer has sort of the

1374
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:10,558
opportunity to make two uh two revenue

1375
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,240
streams you know the Grain and the straw

1376
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,480
that's just more compelling to them

1377
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,719
right um you know the infrastructure to

1378
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,000
to process on the other hand is is

1379
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:19,159
pretty different right I mean the

1380
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,280
equipment you're going to process at

1381
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:23,480
grain width is going to be different

1382
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:25,960
than the straw um so it does require two

1383
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,000
sets of infrastructure there

1384
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,318
um but nevertheless at the farm level

1385
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,920
they can be combined now that's not to

1386
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:34,880
say that you aren't giving something up

1387
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,760
like your yield may go down on the grain

1388
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,519
for both the straw or the or the Grain

1389
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,280
and your quality of the fiber might not

1390
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,280
be as good if it's coming from a grain

1391
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,000
crop those kinds of things but there's

1392
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,839
still opportunities um to address a lot

1393
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,639
of the market share you know because of

1394
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:54,000
that um and so I think that is in in

1395
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:55,639
some cases there are overlaps um like I

1396
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,079
said we do a lot in the animal sector

1397
00:54:55,639 --> 00:55:01,318
right so when we process the straw you

1398
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:03,880
know we sell bedding into equestrian and

1399
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:07,880
small pets um we also have some

1400
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:09,640
non-wovens for uh laying hen mats um but

1401
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:13,480
then on the oil seed side you know we

1402
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:16,239
have omega 369 supplements of the oil uh

1403
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,838
protein you know protein and um and

1404
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:19,879
dietary fiber that all come from the

1405
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:21,599
grain so there are it's a bit of a VIN

1406
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,079
diagram in some places but typically

1407
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,079
you're addressing different markets

1408
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:27,839
where the straw is going to more

1409
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:29,760
industrial materials uh which have a you

1410
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:32,119
know crazy amount of opportunities yeah

1411
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,839
from building materials insulation uh

1412
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:36,240
hemp Crete even potentially to

1413
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:38,480
structural components in the future um

1414
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,798
you know to Pulp and Paper and so on and

1415
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,000
so forth so a lot of diversity in the

1416
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:44,440
opportunity out there what's done to

1417
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,920
eliminating pesticides or heavy metals

1418
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:50,679
that might be present in the crops um

1419
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,639
well you can't really do anything if it

1420
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:54,679
is in the crop to my knowledge I mean

1421
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:57,078
it's hard to remediate it after you've

1422
00:55:54,679 --> 00:56:00,078
you've harvested it um there was a

1423
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:02,680
problem with this um in Canada a little

1424
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:06,599
while back uh there was a large uh you

1425
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:08,318
know a large um Market in in Korea for I

1426
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:10,280
believe hemp seed oil I may butcher this

1427
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,679
a little bit but um I wasn't instantly

1428
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:16,119
involved in it but um but they changed

1429
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:19,519
the regulations on on um you know some

1430
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:21,960
of the uh the assay data and what think

1431
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:23,318
Cobalt might have been the issue is uh

1432
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,760
they were you know they lowered the

1433
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:28,558
allowable levels of cobalt and made a

1434
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,160
big scare you know large markets were

1435
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,400
lost there for for hemp grain um because

1436
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:34,118
once it's in there it's hard to get it

1437
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,680
out it's you're really better off on the

1438
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:39,680
front end right doing your um soil

1439
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:41,480
selection and um you know and picking

1440
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,759
soils that don't have those problems

1441
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,679
because hemp is a phyto remediator it

1442
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,559
will collect those heavy metals um

1443
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:52,558
pesticides yeah I mean uh most

1444
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:54,880
pesticides you can't use on him uh very

1445
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,319
very few are certified so in general

1446
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,200
enal there shouldn't be too much

1447
00:56:56,318 --> 00:57:01,199
pesticide usage on on the HP itself

1448
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:03,118
there may be some residual in the soil

1449
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:04,798
we do test for that for time to time but

1450
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,480
there again once it's in there you can't

1451
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:09,599
really get it out so it's more about um

1452
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:11,000
you know Crop Production practices and

1453
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,119
soil

1454
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
selections which vertigal do you expect

1455
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,599
to grow in the next three to five years

1456
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
um definitely we see the most growth on

1457
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:23,680
the fiber side um Building Materials in

1458
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,519
automotive uh as a guy that's been in

1459
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:26,919
the industry for a while

1460
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:29,400
um I can tell you that it's one of the

1461
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,599
most exciting things happened recently

1462
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,280
uh for you know for our company and to

1463
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,760
my knowledge it's probably the first

1464
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:40,000
time in the US that a uh that that an

1465
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:43,599
automotive supplier formerly asked a

1466
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,318
hemp fiber supplier to bid on a project

1467
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:49,280
um lots of talk lots of triing lots of

1468
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:51,279
stuff but um we we finally got the

1469
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,119
opportunity to actually bid on a on a

1470
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,599
program um so I think Automotive has got

1471
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:56,680
um got some potential in the future

1472
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,280
don't know that we'll get that one I'm

1473
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:01,038
not saying we're going to get it but

1474
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:04,000
pretty big milestone um that that we at

1475
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:06,359
least got for real opportunity to to bid

1476
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,760
so um yeah the fiber side you know we're

1477
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:10,558
seeing lots of growth for the bass fiber

1478
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,480
that doesn't come without challenges on

1479
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,359
the herd side so while the herd

1480
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,960
opportunities are growing the key is

1481
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:19,358
balancing the the herd Demand with the

1482
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,639
fiber production so there are I would

1483
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:24,400
say there are needs on the herd side to

1484
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:26,679
grow markets to complement uh the fiber

1485
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,599
side so wouldn't I wouldn't get too um

1486
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:32,440
overly you know uh optimistic about bass

1487
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,880
fiber because again it's all about that

1488
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:37,200
co- product um utilization to make a

1489
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:40,760
successful business model in finding

1490
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:40,759
paths for off takes for those as

1491
00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:44,959
well um do your Growers all grow

1492
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:48,639
according to the same spec seating rate

1493
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:50,240
variety not exactly um generally yes but

1494
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:53,000
yeah we do a few different varieties we

1495
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:56,279
do a few different models um so yeah we

1496
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,199
do x59 for grain uh we do uh some Asian

1497
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,680
varieties for fiber um those change

1498
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,759
seaing rates are much lower lower for

1499
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:05,318
grain you're in the 20 25 pounds of the

1500
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,640
acre um for fiber you're in the 50 plus

1501
00:59:05,318 --> 00:59:09,119
pounds of the acre fertilization changes

1502
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:10,719
based on those applications and of

1503
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,160
course whatever the soil has in it to

1504
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,639
begin with um so we have some general

1505
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:18,798
guard rails but it is on a farm byarm

1506
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:21,879
basis do you have your Farmers R the

1507
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:24,400
fiber crop yeah I mean we want them to

1508
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:27,119
absolutely we pay more even um some

1509
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:30,559
cases if it is red so uh it's pretty

1510
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:32,960
important for the fiber quality to

1511
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,000
R are there some him specific bio

1512
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,159
remediation efforts impacts and outcomes

1513
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,679
in your community or range of farms yeah

1514
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:40,279
so this is interesting kind of going

1515
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:42,598
back to that question about the uh the

1516
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:45,319
heavy metals right um so there's an

1517
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:46,838
opportunity for Bio or phyter mediation

1518
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:49,279
but then what do you do with that

1519
00:59:46,838 --> 00:59:51,000
material and so there are places that

1520
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,920
don't care where you might be able to

1521
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,440
use that and um you know uh where that

1522
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,760
product can make sense maybe in a

1523
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:01,119
plastic or something like that um but um

1524
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,240
so we're not seeing a lot of that right

1525
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:07,000
now we um uh our our founder Ken is

1526
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:09,159
working uh with a large oil company to

1527
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,159
to do a demonstration project one of the

1528
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:14,879
things I one of the endg games is um

1529
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:16,879
well first it's like you plant the crop

1530
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,480
it it remediates and then there's a few

1531
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,200
stages of what we can do from there turn

1532
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,480
it you know whether it's compost it turn

1533
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:24,118
it into Industrial Products where they

1534
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,599
don't care but then biochar is another

1535
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:28,039
opportunity as well that we're we're

1536
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,480
looking at um it's a good way to sequest

1537
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:33,599
the carbon in um you know and sort of

1538
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,400
triage some of those uh um you know some

1539
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,760
of those uh heavy metals and

1540
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,838
whatnot um and we're pretty much out of

1541
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,160
time here I'll this one last question of

1542
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:44,480
the acreage your Farmers grow how much

1543
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:47,480
is irrigated Almost 100% of our fiber

1544
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,920
acres are irrigated and almost 100% of

1545
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,440
our grain acres are not irrigated um so

1546
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:55,039
that varies by year to year uh you know

1547
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,280
how many acres we're we're growing so so

1548
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:59,319
like this year we'll have 2,000 acres or

1549
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:02,519
we're targeting about 2,000 acres under

1550
01:00:59,318 --> 01:01:07,599
irrigation for um for

1551
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:09,880
fiber so um turn it back over to you

1552
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,880
thanks everybody for joining great

1553

that was a great talk and um you

1555
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:19,798
answered so many questions it was really

1556
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:22,920
really useful and enlightening about uh

1557
01:01:19,798 --> 01:01:25,759
your work and IND hemp um and their

1558
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:28,318
their role in the space so thank you

1559
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,079
very much our next session will be in

1560
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:31,759
two weeks we're going to have Dr David

1561
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,839
Gang from Washington State University

1562
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,200
he's going to talk about expanding the

1563
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:39,400
national hemp DRM plasm collection and

1564
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:41,000
supporting the hemp industry um so the

1565
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:43,400
this recording will be uploaded to our

1566
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:47,159
YouTube page the link for that is in the
