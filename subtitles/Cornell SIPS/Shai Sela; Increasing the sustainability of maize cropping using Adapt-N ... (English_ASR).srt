1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,099
University

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,750
what's the outline for the talk today

4
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:10,599
we're gonna give a little bit of

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,009
background on what's the the

6
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,940
agriculture-related

7
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:18,780
environmental pollution and the

8
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:21,100
complexity of estimating the Wrights

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,320
fertilizer n rates for a particular

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:27,580
field basically the background of why

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,949
the doctor and tool was developed we're

12
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:32,920
gonna talk about the tool discuss its

13
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:35,799
calibration validation studies and I

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,749
will end with few applications I've had

15
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:44,408
a friend in new environmental policies

16
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:46,390
that we now promote promoting and so you

17
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:48,488
know the Green Revolution in the

18
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:52,210
beginning of the century really enabled

19
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:54,518
an increase in crop production and it

20
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,759
came with a price so there's a lot of

21
00:00:54,518 --> 00:01:02,049
environmental concerns related to

22
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:03,658
nitrogen and nitrogen leaching from in

23
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:06,340
[Music]

24
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:08,950
agricultural production first of all a

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:13,240
the production of the fertilizer is very

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:15,310
a energy a costly one percent of all the

27
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:19,118
energy in the world is now devoted into

28
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:22,269
producing nitrogen fertilizer and it has

29
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:26,859
groundwater issues greenhouse gas and

30
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:28,959
also some health issues related to air

31
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:32,828
pollution overall there's a lot of

32
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:35,889
environmental concerns and this is the

33
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:38,649
Gulf of Mexico I'm pretty sure you you

34
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,319
all heard of the dead zone what it's

35
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:44,379
called every summer

36
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:47,129
inputs of nutrients from upstream lead

37
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:50,769
to hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and

38
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:53,679
actually last year or last summer was

39
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:55,750
the largest dead zone ever recorded so

40
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:58,769
in spite of many efforts that has been

41
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:02,978
done it's really hard to show progress

42
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:06,069
in this respect and it's not surprising

43
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:08,679
that the insensitive the production

44
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:12,628
upstream is overwhelming so this is a

45
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,390
land cover a map that yellow are

46
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:17,329
cornfields

47
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:19,549
Green is the soy filled so I mean and

48
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:24,080
this is USDA data and just the immense

49
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:29,480
honor intensity of this system is is is

50
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:33,620
amazing and I want to maybe give a few

51
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:36,340
words about that how we can or what is

52
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,980
currently being done so this is this is

53
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:42,080
rainfall for a location in Iowa from Des

54
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:46,369
Moines Iowa this is the months of the

55
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,340
year so typically a corn is planted at

56
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:56,209
May harvested about in the fall of

57
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:58,159
September and thirty percent of all US

58
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,080
corn growers actually applied their

59
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,359
fertilizer in the fall it it's

60
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,160
logistically it's it's much easier for

61
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,550
them they have time the season is over

62
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:11,000
they have time to go in and and and and

63
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:13,370
fertilize but it's very inefficient to

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,989
fertilize maybe eight months before the

65
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,709
crop actually needs it in the next

66
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:21,110
season so there's a lot of n losses and

67
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:23,209
basically inefficiencies about sixty

68
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,970
percent of farmers applied in the spring

69
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,180
as a pre plant in spring and which is

70
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:32,379
better than a fall treatment but still

71
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:36,230
relatively a or there is some a

72
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:38,090
different time difference between when

73
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:40,548
it the propellant is made in the actual

74
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:47,150
crop uptick in the in the season and

75
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:49,969
another 30 percent or so apply in season

76
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,189
so this is the more advanced way of

77
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:54,919
actually supplying your fertilizer close

78
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:56,599
to when the crop needs it and it's more

79
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,030
efficient and it adds up to more than

80
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:02,409
100% because some farmers of like twice

81
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,489
both in a fall and in the spring and

82
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:07,219
when farmers need to make decisions

83
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:10,400
about their fertilizer and right there's

84
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:14,150
a lot of uncertainty involved and the

85
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,910
iana or the optimum end rate is very

86
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,769
hard to predict and there's a risk of if

87
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,049
you over fertilize there's actually

88
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,810
lower risk than under certain icing and

89
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:27,709
this leads farmers or many farmers to

90
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,129
over apply a fertilizer fertilizer just

91
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,349
to make

92
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:33,189
sure that they're not and efficient

93
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:37,670
there's no deficiency of nitrogen and

94
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:39,350
it's very hard to actually get or

95
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,930
understand what is the right end rate to

96
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,990
a particular field because soil nitrogen

97
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:49,370
is so dynamic and so valuable so it it

98
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,230
has many losses pathway many a sources

99
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,720
of n inputs there's organic matter which

100
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,210
goes mineralization in the field and a

101
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,130
lot of transformation going on in every

102
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:00,439
location in a field and changes in time

103
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:02,990
and in space so it's very hard to

104
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:07,069
understand how much soil you really have

105
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:10,939
in your fields of how much nitrogen you

106
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:12,829
have in your soil so the the fertilizer

107
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:14,899
industry has been promoting what they

108
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:18,199
call the for our concept maybe you heard

109
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:20,149
of it it's basically that farmers should

110
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:24,170
supply their fertilizing the right

111
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:26,870
source the right rate the right time in

112
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:29,480
the right place the four hours of

113
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,550
nutrient management as a concept this is

114
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,470
a good concept it could really advance

115
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,920
farmers into better manage their field

116
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,350
however it is a lot of it's very hard to

117
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,410
implement this concept so what is the

118
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,030
right rate for a specific field what is

119
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,830
the right source is it depending on the

120
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:48,019
rate is depending on the time and so on

121
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:51,289
all of these are is basically interact

122
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:54,560
with each other so farmers have very

123
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:58,340
difficult times in implementing full for

124
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,810
our approach and we in the last few

125
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:02,569
months we've been developing this

126
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,870
conceptual model of how an N rate a

127
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:08,360
dynamic way to estimate nitrogen

128
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:11,899
fertilizer rates should be so in each

129
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,120
field the farmer have its resources the

130
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:17,750
soil type soil health the condition of

131
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,209
the field the climate there are factors

132
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,899
which the farmer actually control the

133
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:27,680
hybrid use of cover crops yes or no what

134
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:29,689
are the tillage and when you need to

135
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,519
make a decision about your n rate you

136
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,230
need to know I'd be either four or three

137
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,049
hours the source of placement in the

138
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,090
timing and of course the whole field is

139
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,009
subjected to weather the effect of

140
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:41,689
weather precipitation temperature solar

141
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,349
radiation or these things that drive to

142
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:44,689
transform a

143
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:48,820
staff nitrogen in the soil so all these

144
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:53,480
factors basically continuously interact

145
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:55,969
in space and in time to to decide or to

146
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:02,210
affect the soil and crop n in any given

147
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:05,030
moment in the field and you can use

148
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:07,719
external inputs like remote sensing like

149
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:12,619
soil test to help N and and and

150
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:14,750
basically and validate or correct your

151
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,370
your estimation of what soil and and

152
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:21,199
crop n in your field and after you have

153
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,090
a good sense of the soil and in Copiah

154
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,620
you need to account for the potential so

155
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:26,209
what are you what use are you expecting

156
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,769
in your field how what's the potential

157
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:30,139
of that specific field

158
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:32,359
what's the economics how much did you

159
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,469
pay for your grains how much do you or

160
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,270
you'll get for your grants how much you

161
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,190
pay for your fertilizer what's the risk

162
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:39,319
and in the end you can estimate the

163
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:43,879
right end rate for a specific location

164
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:46,009
and this is of course a very challenging

165
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,680
and we believe that modeling is a way

166
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,569
forward to do that and and so when you

167
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,370
want to develop a model the way you do

168
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:54,709
it you basically you need a lot of field

169
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,769
data which they need to calibrate your

170
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:59,839
model and then validate your model and

171
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,699
if you're happy with the validation you

172
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,189
move on if not you go back and you're

173
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:06,740
repeatedly collect more data calibrate

174
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:08,569
and validate and in the end your you

175
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,259
need to have an independent model

176
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:16,129
evaluation after your your you feel it's

177
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:19,189
it's validated in us so the enough end

178
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:21,379
tool uses the precision and a precision

179
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:23,899
nitrogen management model the PNM with

180
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:27,500
some other developed here at Cornell by

181
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:29,750
Jeff and Melkonyan it's a it's a

182
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,379
combination of two different models a

183
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:36,049
soil chemistry model each N and a crop

184
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:37,788
growth model model of Sinclair so the

185
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:40,279
leech n does the hydrology and the

186
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:42,139
biogeochemistry of the soil the movement

187
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:45,139
of worded a transformation of carbon in

188
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:47,210
nitrogen and and that in turn affects

189
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:50,629
the crop or the growth of a crop which

190
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:56,079
in this case maize to give a holistic

191
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:59,568
approach to to modeling the the system

192
00:08:56,078 --> 00:09:02,269
so you need data to validate the model

193
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:04,969
so we were lucky here that was before my

194
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:07,220
time of course but Cornell was lucky to

195
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,220
have the with bow Elizabeth is neither

196
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:13,129
made of bloods farm it's a farm a close

197
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,199
to Lake Champlain in Vermont it's

198
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:18,438
basically a farm where you have a

199
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:21,078
difference in soil textures and Cornell

200
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:23,179
has installed this extensive lysimeter

201
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:27,198
plots which allow for to test different

202
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:31,250
soil treatments and collect the drainage

203
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:34,878
and and the leaching and and and and

204
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:39,220
then allow a extensive testing of the

205
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:43,759
model and so the pnm was validated using

206
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,560
this a farm and these are few of our of

207
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,159
the results I would go quickly on that

208
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,799
so this is for nitrate and leaching

209
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:54,679
basically a good agreement between

210
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:58,519
simulated and measured nitrate so in

211
00:09:54,679 --> 00:10:00,528
nitrate a or the leached nitrate and

212
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,839
this is where another experiment where

213
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:05,179
they had a manual application which adds

214
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,240
complexity to the to the model but still

215
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:11,859
the PNM simulated quite nicely with a

216
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,959
good agreement between a measured data

217
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:18,500
the model was also validated for other

218
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:23,059
components like crop and or the yield in

219
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:25,309
different studies so overall the model

220
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:29,958
does a good job in predicting the

221
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:34,309
different components and that was the

222
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:37,359
background or or the PNM was one of the

223
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:41,149
main once the the model was validated

224
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,589
and so in the early 2000 early came to

225
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:46,120
the understanding that it could be used

226
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:49,009
to predict a soil or the nitrogen

227
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,558
dynamics so that's how I adapt n was

228
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:54,800
born so what is adapt ended up in is a

229
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:57,558
decision support tool to help farmer

230
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:00,258
estimators soil end in complex

231
00:10:57,558 --> 00:11:01,578
production environment and it

232
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,769
effectively addresses multiple

233
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:06,620
environment sorry multiple environmental

234
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:09,200
issues of water quality the gaseous lost

235
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,970
is greenhouse gas or ammonia mission

236
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,890
and the energy costs and adapting was

237
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,639
developed as a public-private

238
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:21,590
partnership with a company called atc

239
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:27,439
ergonomic technology corporation a

240
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:30,830
start-up company which has had the

241
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,410
license to to the model and it was

242
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:36,530
commercialized in 2013 and a few months

243
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:38,449
ago atc was acquired by jana for those

244
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:41,449
who don't know jana international is the

245
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,500
world's loudest fertilizer production

246
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:48,200
company it works in 160 countries and

247
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:53,149
they a sort of potential in the tool and

248
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,910
they will invest further and and and and

249
00:11:53,149 --> 00:12:00,559
keep on developing the tools for other

250
00:11:55,909 --> 00:12:03,289
crocks and other locations and this is

251
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:07,299
maybe the time to just to disclose that

252
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:13,730
yalla supports some of the research of

253
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:16,789
daft and here at this in Howard's lab ok

254
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,920
so what is the the features of adapt and

255
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:21,980
I will not go into all of this I'm just

256
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:25,819
a quickly go over it's a very flexible

257
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:29,509
tool it allows a has multiple soil

258
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:32,870
inputs and it goes on a daily time state

259
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:35,629
daily time step resolution high

260
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,419
resolution of climate data it's a six

261
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:42,559
hour lag real almost real-time of Crimea

262
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:47,149
data and 4x4 kilometers resolution in

263
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:49,009
space a special resolution and sorry

264
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:51,709
very flexible in terms of management

265
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,500
inputs of the tillage a of the

266
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:56,210
fertilizer input could be either

267
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,509
inorganic or organic like manure or

268
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:02,269
cover crops and in many a different

269
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:04,819
practices which are actually being done

270
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:06,620
on real fields and very importantly it

271
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,140
allows input from the farmer so the

272
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,720
farmer has measurements of soil and it

273
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:14,830
can add it to the mother and the mother

274
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:19,320
correct estimates according to the

275
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:22,530
observations in the field and

276
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,030
does adapt in recommend and rates or

277
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:26,220
what's the adapting approach it's a

278
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:30,480
dynamic must balance must balance

279
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:34,350
approach but it means that the nitrogen

280
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,649
accommodation is dependent on the

281
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,509
expected yield the grower needs to

282
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:43,009
supply what is a reasonable yield for

283
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:46,019
that location and then the model in

284
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:47,970
accounts for how much is already in the

285
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,610
crop and how much is already in the soil

286
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:53,310
in this two components are simulated by

287
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:57,330
the PNM order okay and then it accounts

288
00:13:53,309 --> 00:14:00,479
for the previous crop fair credits for

289
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:02,340
example soybean and future gains for

290
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,620
mineralization for that soil type for

291
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,649
that location or losses fruit weather

292
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,120
and another profit risk factor that

293
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:15,149
accounts for the the prices of grain and

294
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,730
filter either it could be run either on

295
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:19,590
a whole field could be run on a zone it

296
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,430
can be run in a fully gridded VLT a

297
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:30,080
high-resolution variable rate a

298
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:34,019
prescription very flexible and and in

299
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:36,060
accommodating real-life practices the

300
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,730
tool was independently validated now in

301
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:42,119
many studies I wouldn't just show a few

302
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,830
of them this is a study that we had

303
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,730
published two years ago in agronomy

304
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:52,980
journal which used trip trial data from

305
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:56,190
113 trials a in New York and in Iowa and

306
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,139
in each trial we had either a rate

307
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,950
recommended by adapt n using our

308
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:05,159
adaptive approach or by the grower a

309
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:07,650
selected rate and these are the results

310
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:11,069
just to quickly walk you through so this

311
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:13,289
is the grower rate adapt n rate and this

312
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,060
is the one to one line so if the data is

313
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:18,329
higher or above this line it's either

314
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:21,719
grow rate is higher then respective

315
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:24,660
adapt n rate and what we found that in

316
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,269
83 percent of the ultras adapting

317
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:30,269
actually allow the reduction in an

318
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:33,240
application and quite significant 45

319
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:37,649
kilograms per hectare cross to 35%

320
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:40,528
action in in fertilizer input just note

321
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:42,809
that there was few instances few cases

322
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:44,759
were adopting actually recommended

323
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,789
higher end rates than the grower in the

324
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,610
winter season and so it's not only

325
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:54,649
reducing it's about adjusting the right

326
00:15:50,610 --> 00:16:00,240
in rate to the specific location and

327
00:15:54,649 --> 00:16:02,208
these are the the yields so practically

328
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,899
there is no difference in yields between

329
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:09,509
a dynamic approach and the static or

330
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,330
basically the grower approach and this

331
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:14,730
means that the 34 or 35 percent of

332
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,050
additional nitrogen supplied by grow is

333
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,470
actually in excess you can actually

334
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:22,049
reduce that without reducing your yield

335
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,190
and in fact the yield is if you look at

336
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:25,109
the different it's just it's not

337
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,839
significant but it is higher for that

338
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,399
and because there are cases like I said

339
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,680
before we are adopting recommended more

340
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:35,490
nitrogen that led to much higher yield

341
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:37,229
and of course if you reduce your n

342
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,450
inputs and you don't reduce your yield

343
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:43,470
you increase your profit and enough n

344
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:46,589
leads to increase of $65 per hectare

345
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,600
which is a significant increase and it

346
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:52,980
just proved that it could be a win-win

347
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,860
situation you can actually M apply less

348
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:59,940
nitrogen and still make it more

349
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,528
profitable for the farmer what about the

350
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,570
environmental losses so this is

351
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:06,779
simulated losses this is not measured in

352
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:09,808
all of this hundreds of trials and so an

353
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:12,420
average reduction of 36% in leaching

354
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:14,869
losses and close to 40% in gaseous

355
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:18,150
losses so there's also a large

356
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:22,379
environmental benefit in using a tool

357
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:24,540
like that and so there are many tools

358
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,910
that are not promoted for US corn

359
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:29,220
production which are static meaning day

360
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,100
for the same season they recommend the

361
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,079
same end rate and regardless of the

362
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:37,389
seasonal weather and for

363
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:41,589
New York one such tool is the corn n

364
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,970
calculator which is called the CNC it's

365
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:44,980
a tool that was originally developed

366
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,440
here at this department maybe 40 years

367
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,528
ago and historically it's the tool

368
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,870
that's been promoted for farmers in the

369
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:55,079
state of New York so we wanted to

370
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:59,319
compare our adaptive approach to this

371
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:02,230
static a tool and we did it using

372
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:04,240
multiple --android trials what is that

373
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,370
des is trials where you have multiple n

374
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,679
rates where you have your do you collect

375
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:10,869
the yield and then it allows you to

376
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,730
construct this curve it's called the

377
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:14,859
response curve and you can actually

378
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,899
calculate the optimum and rate for

379
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:18,459
specific season for specific field and

380
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:20,229
this is of course a perfect hindsight

381
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,329
okay so this in the end of the season

382
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,669
you know what in hindsight was the

383
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:27,730
optimum n right but it allows to then

384
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:29,740
take a different tools that could have

385
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,019
10 or like the CNC and compare them

386
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:36,490
using this data and see how do they

387
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:39,849
perform and a few words about the CNC

388
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:42,190
it's a static tool basically it's a

389
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:46,408
factor which multiplies by by dieter

390
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:50,649
yield and some correction for the soil

391
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:54,250
and in the efficiency of drainage in a

392
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:58,239
location and we compare it to that

393
00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:00,750
adaptive tool so both of the tools rely

394
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,849
on yield input okay so this is very

395
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,950
important on the left here what you can

396
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:08,709
see that this is the achieved yield in

397
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,298
the trials versus the estimated the

398
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,548
years that were estimated by the growers

399
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:14,980
and we found that growers have a very

400
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:16,119
good sense of what's the the potential

401
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,819
of their field okay

402
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:22,839
a remarkable actually quite freed three

403
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:27,788
bushels per acre difference and if you

404
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:30,359
use the the actual default yields in the

405
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:32,558
database of the CNC we found that it

406
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:35,379
underestimates the yield that were

407
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:40,379
measuring in the field so in quite

408
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,380
largely in about 60 bushels per acre and

409
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:47,089
you use these default yields which come

410
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:50,000
with the CNC database and you use that

411
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:53,329
to generate and recommendation this is

412
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
the outcome so this is the optimum and

413
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:58,099
rate measured in each fields and this is

414
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,890
the recommendation so this is for the

415
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:03,589
default yield of the CNC basically we

416
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,059
found it to be under the optimum n rate

417
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:06,199
because you have a low estimation of the

418
00:20:05,058 --> 00:20:09,109
yield so that drives a low

419
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,140
recommendation and below the Eowyn our

420
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:13,969
men rate 40 pounds below and if you take

421
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,400
the measured yield or the estimated

422
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,289
deals that's by the farmers and you plug

423
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,050
it into the calculator we found that

424
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:24,740
it's actually other estimates the yield

425
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:28,099
to me the the ER now by close to 80

426
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:32,230
pounds per acre so it's not just about

427
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:35,509
correcting the yield input and if we

428
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:38,750
compare adapt and to the EO and now we

429
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:42,019
found I'm actively a better performance

430
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,400
it's an average six pounds below the

431
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:45,589
optimum end rates which is quite

432
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,570
remarkable because just remember that

433
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:50,119
you know these decisions regarding the N

434
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:51,710
rates are are made in the beginning of

435
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:56,539
the season you don't know what will

436
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:59,480
actually be a occur you know as the

437
00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:01,549
season progresses and and and and the

438
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,400
tool was able to you know when the UNL

439
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:06,859
was was was low the to recommended lower

440
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,300
and rates and when the ER now is higher

441
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:12,049
that's were committed more and as an

442
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:16,869
overall a nice correlation between n

443
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:19,180
rates and the measured optimum so this

444
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:22,419
we just supports that our adaptive

445
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:30,380
approach is is performs better than than

446
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:33,570
a static approach okay so and up then

447
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:36,300
competed in the Thule nitrogen reduction

448
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:39,049
challenge I don't know if you heard

449
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:43,220
about it it's it's a challenge which

450
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:46,529
initiated by Tulane University and they

451
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,240
basically called for four teams from

452
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:50,639
around the world to submit their

453
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,910
solution to reduce to reduce the

454
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,880
nitrogen a leaching from agricultural

455
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:59,340
production systems and seventy-seven

456
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,410
teams they applied their solution from

457
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:04,799
around the world it's a two it was a two

458
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:07,830
and a half year process and a committee

459
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,839
of 16 experts they reviewed each tool

460
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:12,449
and there were finalists that were

461
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,279
invited to apply their tool on real

462
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:16,740
production environments and real farms

463
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:20,960
in Louisiana and demonstrate the tool

464
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:23,430
and a month ago two months ago we were

465
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,930
invited to New Orleans where we were

466
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:31,470
told at adapt in won the competition so

467
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:35,970
out of 77 teams that the committee found

468
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:39,210
our solution to be a optimal and and

469
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:43,019
that was really encouraging there is a

470
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:45,750
nice prize associated with that that

471
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:47,819
would go into further development of the

472
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,700
tool but more than that it's the

473
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:52,889
recognition that other people also see

474
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,809
the potential of our tools of the

475
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:59,730
potential of this approach of of a

476
00:22:54,809 --> 00:23:03,960
dynamically estimating n rates and that

477
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:07,799
was of course very encouraging okay so

478
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:10,590
in the few minutes that I have I want to

479
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:15,000
just present how we use it up then in

480
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:18,299
environmental policies and there are

481
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,400
large companies like Walmart but not

482
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:23,009
only what a large retail companies that

483
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,500
that want to reduce their their carbon

484
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:27,450
footprint and Walmart for example came

485
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,180
to the conclusion that fertilizer

486
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:33,000
accounts for almost 50% of their carbon

487
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:36,360
footprint and they're looking to ways to

488
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,279
to basically track the sustainability of

489
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:43,740
their of the production and and and how

490
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,879
they can improve it

491
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:50,990
and we in in a paper just recently

492
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,760
accepted to bioscience we we think that

493
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:56,370
index called the end surplus or n

494
00:23:53,759 --> 00:24:00,000
balance is a suitable index for that and

495
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:02,939
and this it's a very nice paper it's

496
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,319
freely available in in bioscience

497
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:11,190
website and so what is n surplus it's a

498
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:14,009
very simple index it's n inputs either

499
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:17,910
by fertilizer or by my new organic other

500
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:20,640
organic a - the amount of n which is

501
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:23,550
removed by the crop okay so the what's

502
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,370
left behind the surplus this is the

503
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:29,129
index and there are many studies now

504
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:33,719
that find that n surplus when you

505
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:35,970
increase n surplus a foot in the first

506
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,400
stage you have no increase in your new

507
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:41,250
squared losses so basically the

508
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,650
fertilizer you you add translate into

509
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,058
higher yields so there is it's not lost

510
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,519
to the environment but there is a

511
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:51,269
threshold in n surface where further

512
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:55,889
increase really drives environmental

513
00:24:51,269 --> 00:25:01,019
losses increase and the idea is that you

514
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:05,640
can use this so a and surplus index to

515
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:07,859
track a or to better track the

516
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,140
sustainability of your field and I will

517
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:11,729
show that here we explore this in the

518
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,230
bioscience paper using synthetic

519
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:18,179
simulations and we had five states in

520
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:22,710
five biggest con production states and

521
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:25,200
when I did in in the Midwest and three

522
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,819
scenarios full tree plant where most of

523
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,130
the corn is a most of most of that

524
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:30,779
fertilizer is applied in a fall spring

525
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,610
pre plant where most of the filter is

526
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,319
applied in a spring and a split

527
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:35,969
application where you have a more

528
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,919
distorter in the beginning of the season

529
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:42,240
but most of the filter is applied in

530
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:45,150
season okay and we always use the Duff

531
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,910
tend to check if there is there is any N

532
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:50,910
deficiency is expected and if there was

533
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:53,220
we added more end so we eliminated any

534
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,519
in deficiencies in all of our scenarios

535
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,910
all of our simulations

536
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:00,950
this is the result we found it is a nice

537
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,320
relationship between an circus and

538
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:06,500
musical end losses for our Midwest

539
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:09,559
location and what we also found that

540
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,430
full application here in the Blue has a

541
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,440
mean value of a hundred seventy-five

542
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:17,810
kilogram and surface value of 175

543
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,330
kilogram per hectare and if you shift

544
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:22,730
your application to the spring the green

545
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:25,069
here you immediately reduce it quite

546
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,890
substantially to 125 kilograms per

547
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:30,559
hectare and if you reduce it or you

548
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:33,050
shifted further into the season you can

549
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,299
actually have a mean value of close to

550
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:37,159
thirty kilograms per hectare so there's

551
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:39,799
a lot a lot of improvement that can be

552
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:45,050
done by shifting the timing of your

553
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:47,389
management into in season and but we

554
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:50,419
wanted to further explore what else can

555
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:54,740
growers do to reduce their and surplus

556
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:57,860
so what I did I used a field data so

557
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:01,390
this is experiment of that 127 trials

558
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:05,479
that we had in seven US states in every

559
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:07,940
trial we had either a rate a recommended

560
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:12,559
by adapt an a dynamic approach versus a

561
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:16,070
static approach and what we found is

562
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:19,669
that in surplus is also of course

563
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:22,159
related to the yield squared losses it's

564
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:26,150
much more noisier than our simulation

565
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,610
results but if we add here that the beam

566
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:32,300
that you can see that it starts to

567
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:34,789
increase actually at about 75 kilograms

568
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:36,799
per hectare of an surplice Vario but we

569
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:40,970
wanted to really get a more quantitative

570
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:44,539
estimation of this a threshold so we we

571
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:48,620
did regressions a hockey stick function

572
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:50,659
or basically there's a seg

573
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:55,009
which is straight which connected to a

574
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:58,009
linear increase and the inflection point

575
00:27:55,009 --> 00:28:01,519
where n or n losses begin to increase

576
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:04,579
with n surplus is optimized so what we

577
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,950
found that we did it two times first to

578
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:09,169
the adaptive data set it for a static

579
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,330
data set separately and what we found

580
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:14,960
that about 48 kilograms per hectare

581
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:17,500
about 50 is a region where n losses

582
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:22,340
really begin to increase in our

583
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:25,190
experimental sites so now we've taking

584
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:28,339
this threshold and we went back to the

585
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:31,490
data and compared the treatments so here

586
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:33,709
is the 48 a kilogram of enterprise value

587
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:36,019
this is another value from the

588
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:40,429
literature 78 kilograms for a paper by

589
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:42,289
zhang a two three years ago a it's a

590
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:45,380
it's a larger so it's a more

591
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:47,899
relaxed and surplus a upper limit and

592
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,760
this is what we found this is the

593
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,910
cumulative distribution right so our

594
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,849
start of our experimental and data so

595
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:57,679
when you use a static approach only a

596
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:59,750
mine about 15 percent of the time you

597
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:04,519
can actually meet that target of then

598
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:07,819
the 50 or 48 kilograms per hectare of n

599
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:11,210
circles and if you use an adaptive

600
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:13,519
approach that's you have three times

601
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:17,120
more likely to be within that region

602
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:21,379
it's close to 50 percent of the time you

603
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:23,329
are within that a limit and this got us

604
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:26,330
thinking because you know if using a

605
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:29,689
tool like a defend which is one of the

606
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:31,939
more advanced tools out there even using

607
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,920
a tool like it up in only 50% of the

608
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,170
times farmers are able to meet those

609
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,179
those regions of answer Brussels where

610
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:41,029
Anastas begin to increase so what is

611
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:42,920
realistic what is a realistic model to

612
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:45,470
expect for farmers if you now want to

613
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,420
build and and and and and and tell

614
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,679
farmers to improve their their

615
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:52,850
management you have to give them a

616
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:54,860
realistic set of values so we extended

617
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:59,469
the bioscience simulation to include

618
00:29:54,859 --> 00:30:01,819
more soil types we added inhibitors and

619
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,519
similar to the to the bioscience

620
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:04,829
approach in

621
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,470
relation we always supplied enough n to

622
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:09,210
eliminate any n deficiencies and this is

623
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:13,019
what we found this is for a standalone

624
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:16,380
course low across the soil in a dry

625
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:20,210
location like Nebraska and so if you use

626
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:22,890
a full application without inhibitors

627
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:25,710
you have about 30 percent of the times

628
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:31,110
we always in the region that or the 48

629
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:34,019
kilogram a let's say target adding

630
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:37,019
inhibitors improves the situation you

631
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:39,539
can bring more cases into that region

632
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:41,400
for a spring application further

633
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:43,289
improvement adding inhibitors to our

634
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,450
spring application still another

635
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:47,789
improvement but the real improvement

636
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,850
goes or happens when you move into the

637
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:54,470
street application and go in season and

638
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:59,929
just supply fertilizer closer to one

639
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:02,640
crop actually it needs it and in fact

640
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:04,740
just by shifting your management into

641
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,360
incision it's very feasible to to match

642
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,690
those targets if you're in a dry

643
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:11,369
location so so it can be done but what

644
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:14,519
happens if you're in a much wetter

645
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:19,229
location like Indiana and so this is

646
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:21,150
full application without inhibitors this

647
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:23,279
is full application with inhibitors are

648
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:27,390
great improvement yeah but I mean it's

649
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:29,759
just way off the target and spring

650
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:32,400
without inhibitors and spring with

651
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,779
inhibitors better than the fall but

652
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:38,400
still a lot of the times you're not

653
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:38,740
within a target region and when you do

654
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,690
the

655
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:45,069
sprits application it's of course the

656
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:47,410
largest improvement but still 60% of the

657
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:49,720
times you can't make it or very hard for

658
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:55,058
farmers to actually maybe we think that

659
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:55,750
that region a target region so what else

660
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:57,460
can they do

661
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:01,029
what's what are the options for greater

662
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:04,269
efficiency first of all farmers can it

663
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:07,569
could be a trade-off between the farmers

664
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:11,470
profit and in the environmental aspects

665
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:13,750
you can do a modest yield reduction by

666
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:17,230
not basically pressing the system so

667
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:19,720
much and I will the next slide I will

668
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:22,779
present that you can have further

669
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,880
optimization by a multiple an

670
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:26,889
application throughout the season today

671
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,260
they have high clearance equipment

672
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:31,990
farmers can actually go to three times

673
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:34,900
within the season and almost spoon feed

674
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:38,109
their crop with the nitrogen so a much

675
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:41,140
more efficient way of supplying your

676
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:45,359
nutrients and you can have a greater use

677
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:49,360
of cover crops in our simulations here

678
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:52,928
we found so the in many cases there were

679
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:55,808
a lot of residuals so n in the soil in

680
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:59,050
the end of a simulation and this is here

681
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:01,599
a highlighted in the red color so the

682
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:04,169
red is cases where the residual soil end

683
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:06,699
is greater than 50 kilograms per hectare

684
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:08,410
and there's quite a lot of it not

685
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:11,140
surprising rates well the simulated

686
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:13,509
yield losses are low but this is just

687
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,670
usually soil and in the end of the

688
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:17,650
season is prone to be lost during the

689
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:23,500
winter or during the early spring the

690
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:25,840
next season so if you can apply cover

691
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:31,819
crops that can actually consume and use

692
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:35,629
this residual so n so if I want to

693
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:39,679
again this is the the response curve of

694
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:44,000
an r8 and yield this is from 16 trials

695
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:46,390
that we had in Indiana and the black

696
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,150
line is the mean value of all these

697
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:52,250
experimental sites and Green Line is the

698
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:57,920
optimum n rate calculated for this curve

699
00:33:52,250 --> 00:34:00,230
and as you approach the the high end

700
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,600
rates that the increasing yield of

701
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,700
course diminishes and it's it's less

702
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:07,309
efficient so you get less yield her

703
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:10,550
nitrogen that you apply when you go to

704
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:12,829
the higher regions and in fact if you

705
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,230
reduce just five bushels from that

706
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:18,529
optimum and rate which is about two

707
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:21,070
percent of your yield you reduce 60% of

708
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:23,269
your n inputs if you reduced ten bushels

709
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:26,150
which is still only five percent

710
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:30,710
reduction in yields you reduce almost 30

711
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:33,260
percent of n inputs okay so what we and

712
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:37,400
this is this is something we are now

713
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:40,070
exploring this can be translated into

714
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,829
reduction in n surplus so the five

715
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:45,890
bushels reduction in yield is actually

716
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:48,559
30 kilograms per hectare reduction in n

717
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:50,179
losses and the farmers of course will

718
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:54,019
need to be compensated for that they're

719
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:56,119
making less profit but so the

720
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:59,090
compensation would be about 20 dollars

721
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:03,039
per hectare if you reduced 10 bushels

722
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:05,390
it's about fifty or forty five a

723
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:08,090
kilograms of in surplus reduction and

724
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:09,980
about sixty dollars compensation and the

725
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:11,900
idea is that you can now go into those

726
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:15,800
locations where it's actually very prone

727
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:20,690
to to losses and and and and and just

728
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:23,480
maybe help shift the trials back into

729
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:26,389
the region by nuts stressing the system

730
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:32,050
so much and compensating the farmers for

731
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:36,849
further profit loss okay so if you'll

732
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:39,580
take home messages from this seminar

733
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:41,889
adopt n allows

734
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:44,860
action of n apply an application without

735
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:46,569
reduction of yield and and it just

736
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:50,140
proved that there could be a win-win

737
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:52,059
situation where the farmer it increases

738
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:55,150
its profit and and there's less

739
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:57,159
environmental pollution we found a

740
00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:00,010
dynamic approach to be much better than

741
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:02,649
a static approach in estimating n rates

742
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:07,720
and it leads to to higher profitability

743
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:11,559
and lower environmental pollution and a

744
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:14,500
tool like that then could be used to set

745
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:18,159
standards to of what is achievable any

746
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,809
any efficiency or in surplus values for

747
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,199
different production environments and

748
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:25,690
then policy makers in news based and us

749
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,879
and and think what are the practices how

750
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:32,019
wouldn't what practices can we promote

751
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:35,050
that will help achieve those a standards

752
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:37,449
or achieve those targets and and perhaps

753
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:40,590
they could shifted that the production

754
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:46,409
environment into a more sustainable

755
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:49,030
production okay thank you

756
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:51,460
many people collaborated in help of

757
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:56,830
course along the years of course how old

758
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:59,710
a Jeff and Peter and many others and of

759
00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:01,509
course a lot of funding helped along the

760
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:06,300
way and I'll be happy to answer

761
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:10,819
questions if you have thank you

762
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,818
[Applause]

763
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:26,179
yeah so we did that and we have adapting

764
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:28,639
can simulate multiple either night by

765
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:30,769
rain like a notification inhibitor or a

766
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,799
duel more like a always inhibitor and a

767
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:35,929
notification so does many its inhibitors

768
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,880
we do simulate the data that have

769
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:43,909
presented is from Nitro pirates so

770
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:47,809
that's an extra 15 inhibitor you're in

771
00:37:43,909 --> 00:37:54,339
equation in soil that would be and then

772
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:54,340
you have a and expected in the future

773
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:10,579
yeah so for each so for each site we

774
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:15,349
have in the in the estimation of n rates

775
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:17,840
okay so when you adapt and recommend a n

776
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:20,150
rate so it's true that you have that

777
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,010
simulated in the crop in an end by the P

778
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:24,590
N and there's also a component that

779
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:27,440
accounts of future mineralization so

780
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:30,500
that's so that's depending on the

781
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,780
organic matter for the site specific and

782
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:35,059
it's based on long term simulations for

783
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:38,150
a similar sort of in a similar region

784
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:40,489
so what's yes that's an expected sim

785
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:51,110
contribution from mineralization for

786
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:54,439
that soil type in that region for the

787
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:56,769
coming season and how what is here to

788
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,769
answer

789
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:19,039
[Music]

790
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,869
between like or most the us were were

791
00:39:26,599 --> 00:40:32,269
very good shape we're probably going to

792
00:39:29,869 --> 00:40:36,320
be looking questions yes so so the soul

793
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:43,940
type the soul inputs are according for

794
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:47,660
or depending on the location yeah yeah

795
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:50,358
so you can't really calibrate the model

796
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:52,608
for everywhere your your client it's

797
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:55,909
been calibrated quite extensively in the

798
00:40:52,608 --> 00:41:02,710
Midwest and in the Northeast and in

799
00:40:55,909 --> 00:41:05,809
mid-atlantic in North Carolina and so

800
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,369
you know if if we have better data for

801
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:11,449
that location through a calibration

802
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:15,789
study we we improved the coefficients if

803
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:18,319
not correctly for wrong how there's a

804
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:23,529
default coefficient depending on the so

805
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,530
type in organic matter and and USDA de

806
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:33,288
it uses a lot of site-specific

807
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:33,288
information so we have Cyril databases

808
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:49,098
relating to in a way interesting issue

809
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:56,338
that we have because of the plane

810
00:41:49,099 --> 00:42:01,679
challenge the technology to our

811
00:41:56,338 --> 00:42:04,708
submission and then we have to prove and

812
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:08,759
so we even though we had we have a model

813
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:10,469
available for that and so here you are

814
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:13,679
in like the Olympics you only get one

815
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:18,739
shot you know what to do it right so but

816
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,739
we were very very happy with the model

817
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:46,380
so it's robust enough you know so you

818
00:42:35,518 --> 00:43:01,879
have the weather in your simulation how

819
00:42:46,380 --> 00:43:01,880
can you do like okay so a forecast of

820
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:09,358
course of course so the components that

821
00:43:06,268 --> 00:43:11,848
use the historical simulation like the

822
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,130
losses this is the component here the

823
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:15,449
future minimization also temperature you

824
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,979
know and so it's all hard to predict for

825
00:43:15,449 --> 00:43:19,369
to be soil temperature in three months

826
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:24,178
from now so it's based on long-term

827
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:27,150
simulation of historical data and I know

828
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:29,278
that there is a feature that the company

829
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,289
is working on where it will be a

830
00:43:29,278 --> 00:43:35,440
short-term forecast

831
00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:37,660
I'm not months probably

832
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,329
a few days or maybe a week our I don't

833
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:43,719
know exactly but that will allow to also

834
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:47,380
account for the meal weather forecast

835
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:51,009
when and if there's like a rainfall or

836
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:53,500
some future immediate losses which are

837
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:55,720
expected so the N rate will be corrected

838
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,699
to account for that and this is a

839
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:00,669
feature that they're working on now it's

840
00:43:57,699 --> 00:44:03,779
not currently implemented in the model

841
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,780
[Music]

842
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:36,700
yeah but we do what we do account for

843
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,079
that by those historical simulation and

844
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:43,960
of course there's uncertainty I mean you

845
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:46,599
do 20 or 30 years of simulation and you

846
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,309
get an expected season or with

847
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,430
uncertainty you can in you can account

848
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:52,929
for that uncertainty or correct your

849
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:54,578
estimation but it's its historical it's

850
00:44:52,929 --> 00:45:30,519
true it's a source of uncertainty in

851
00:44:54,579 --> 00:45:34,480
model prediction any question yes yeah

852
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:37,750
and so the modern accounts for the

853
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:41,579
hybrids that act the growler needs to

854
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:45,489
the long list of hybrids that the farmer

855
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:47,289
need to or basically supply which one is

856
00:45:45,489 --> 00:45:48,858
being used on that field and then the

857
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:51,518
parameters are tuned for

858
00:45:48,858 --> 00:45:51,518
I'm

859
00:48:38,759 --> 00:48:57,599
he were building building knowledge

860
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:57,599
basin every generation what questions

861
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:04,719
