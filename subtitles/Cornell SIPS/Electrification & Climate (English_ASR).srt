curriculum working groups webinar series

8
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,280
and today's theme is electrification and

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,600
climate and you can hear

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,200
from Brian Stewart Mark Pullman and

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,520
Sarah Brock from their various different

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,600
perspectives on

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,520
electrification I'm not going to read

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,840
bios um that's all in the registration

15

next slide so what is the national

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,759
extension climate initiative uh we are

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,360
uh serve as an anchor for extension

22
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,400
professionals researchers and partners

23
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,438
to collaborate on climate related issues

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,000
share resources discuss barriers and

25
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,719
opportunities for advancing climate

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,438
change programming and extension and

27
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,679
engage in professional development

28
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:25,399

initiative.

38
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:47,478
net um we this is the fourth of the

39
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,640
series we had one on Youth and climate

40
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:52,239
in September 1890 land grant

41
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,680
institutions in October and we have one

42
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,839
on resiliency in December you can find

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,039
more I'll put these into the link as

44

soon as I'm off for my part but you can

45
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:06,079
find it on our seminar series and on the

46
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,718
recordings on our YouTube channel so

47
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,679
that is to segue that this will be

48
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:12,479
recorded and uploaded to our web page

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,800
around 7 days after the event please use

50
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,079
the chat for Logistics and the Q&amp;A for

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,319
questions of the speakers we Endeavor to

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,200
start and stop on time we will not read

53
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,598
bio bios we aspire to be a resource of

54
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,518
many resources from which you can draw

55
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,878
upon for your own Regional work so we

56
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,640
hope you find at least one person today

57
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,120
that really resonates with you because

58
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,079
we advocate for a new kind of R&amp;D which

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,800
is research and

60
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,879
duplicate um just a heads up this is

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,239
what will be happening in December Kim

62
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,878
Davis will be talking about resil

63
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,599
building climate resiliency through

64
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,719
disaster preparedness Megan will talk

65
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:54,280
about preparing agents of change for

66
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:57,800
tomorrow in appala and Jack Voit who is

67
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,239
a undergraduate student will be uh

68
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,560
talking about some work that he's been

69
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,000
doing um for americor on filling gaps in

70
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,360
coastal communities I'll put those links

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,639
in the chat

72
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,640
uh and

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,799
then uh also there is a another webinar

74
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,519
about efficiency and electrification

75
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,879
that's happening in November 19th on

76
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,959
Cornell's campus which has similar and

77
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:29,359
different topics including um Pilots

78
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:33,158
working on uh mobile homes and farm

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,360
energy audits among other things okay I

80
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:41,560
think that's it um so I'm going to stop

81
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:44,680
share so Brian do you want to launch

82
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,120
sure thank you um hello everyone I'm

83
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,040
Brian Stewart and uh as it mentioned by

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,079
the one of the co-founders of Electrify

85
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,639
now and this whole topic about whether

86
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,159
climate act whether electrification is a

87
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,878
you can be thought of as a climate

88
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:00,798
action or a personal benefit is near and

89
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,239
dear to me because it's basically the

90
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,079
heart of what we try to do in our

91
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,599
Communications and of course the short

92
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,959
answer is both of these things but what

93
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:09,878
I'm going to try to do today is just

94
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,079
talk to you about you know my experience

95
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:14,239
with how of telling this story now for

96
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,759
over five years and what I've learned

97
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,840
and what I think is most effective ways

98
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:22,040
in ter in in terms of telling this story

99
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,758
um so but this this sort of like um

100
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,960
dichotomy between climate action and

101
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,800
personal benefit is at the heart of the

102
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,839
of the communications and one of the

103
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,879
things that we have that's fortunate

104
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,359
about this story is that because it's

105
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,199
both it makes means that there's

106
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,000
multiple motivations for people to get

107
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,000
involved in this once they understand it

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,519
there's another dichotomy involved in

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,439
this which I think is every bit as

110
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,279
important which is about the kind of

111
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,879
interplay between individual action and

112
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:53,359
systems change if you think back to the

113
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:55,759
um origins of the uh environmental

114
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,919
movement in the 70s if someone was

115
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,038
saying well what are you going to do

116
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:00,839
personally in order to kind of help

117
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,038
protect the planet most of the things

118
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,359
that we had available to us were about

119
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,759
using fewer resources kind of depriving

120
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,439
ourselves in some ways of things that we

121
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,479
wanted like you know turning your

122
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,519
thermostat down or taking a cold shower

123
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,800
or something like that it's about using

124
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:18,279
less of things that are bad but now we

125
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,000
have this whole different Paradigm with

126
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:22,799
electrification where your individual

127
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,160
actions are accomplishing that but more

128
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,840
importantly your sort of disassembling

129
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,360
the system that's at the heart of the

130
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:31,599
climate change problem and you are you

131
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,319
have the potential to be building parts

132
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,360
of this new system that should replace

133
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:38,039
it that promises a better future and

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,000
we'll talk about that all right the

135
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,959
other thing I would like to always keep

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,959
in mind as I'm having this conversation

137
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:47,318
is that that I want to supply a context

138
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,399
that's both Global because people this

139
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,520
is a big problem it's a global problem

140
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,439
but bring it back to a really personal

141
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,000
level um and realize that people have

142
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,918
different motivations they might be

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,160
really motivated by a problem that

144
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,318
they're trying to solve or they might

145
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,360
just really feel excited about embracing

146
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,479
a solution that looks attractive both

147
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,280
those things are important and then

148
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:10,079
although facts are maligned as a um as a

149
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,119
motivator for people to actually take

150
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,800
action I I think that they're it's

151
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,478
important to use facts to our advantage

152
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,319
and connect them to these more emotional

153
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,439
drivers like health and safety and

154
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,800
comfort that are equally important in

155
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,879
terms of the reasons why people might

156
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,400
actually take action but connecting

157
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,918
those things is helpful and it's a way

158
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,638
for us to myth bust which which is

159
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,680
important to do without giving too much

160
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,199
Credence to the myths and then finally

161
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,840
you know you can really understand this

162
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,879
but unless you have a good way of taking

163
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:44,679
action it's not that helpful so what I

164
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,800
like to remind myself is that we need to

165
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,079
be able to explain people what these

166
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,038
things are that you could do but also

167
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,159
remove barriers for people as much as

168
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,839
possible so that it's easy as possible

169
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,160
for people to do it because these things

170
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,598
can be can feel

171
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,479
complicated all right so just as a

172
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,360
starting point I've really changed my

173
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:05,439
thinking about how to begin this

174
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,360
conversation I used to start with a

175
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,598
picture of you know the kind of climate

176
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,960
change problem I don't really talk about

177
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:14,598
climate change that much I really mostly

178
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,799
talk assume people understand it and are

179
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:18,918
somewhat motivated because they of their

180
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
understanding but I really launch into

181
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:23,478
this from a standpoint of the benefits

182
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,598
and this kind of came from my work with

183
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:28,878
ARP where you know they were kind of

184
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,639
reluctant to to to go too hard on the

185
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,520
the carbon Mission standpoint because it

186
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,199
felt political to them but they were

187
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,038
comfortable if I talked about it as long

188
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,639
as I couch it in terms of these benefits

189
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,439
that were economic and health benefits

190
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,720
to their customers but I realize that

191
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,839
that's just a good way to talk about

192
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,720
this there are huge advantages to doing

193
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,959
this as a homeowner in particular which

194
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,639
is our kind of target audience because

195
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,359
it's going to reduce your bills and Make

196
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,918
a Better Living experience but it also

197
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,439
reduces air pollution in a really

198
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,359
dramatic way and carbon pollution so

199
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,519
depending on your point of view here all

200
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,680
those things are important I don't shy

201
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:04,478
away from this one fact though which is

202
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,759
so important to land because I don't

203
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,800
think people really get it in some ways

204
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,560
in fact when we started Electrify now it

205
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,720
was partly out of the frustration that I

206
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,839
felt that it seemed like all the popular

207
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,800
media just wanted to talk about plastic

208
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,079
straws and there was no conversation in

209
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,759
the public media sort of five years ago

210
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,800
about the importance of energy and the

211
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,520
fact that it's at the heart of this

212
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,840
problem I think that's really changed

213
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,560
which is encouraging but I think people

214
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,119
still need to be aware of the fact that

215
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,479
it's burning fossil fuels that are at

216
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,719
the heart of this problem of course

217
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,320
there are other issues land use food

218
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,399
production Etc I don't mean to downplay

219
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,080
them and Plastics waste again I'm not

220
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,080
poo pooing that it's just that if it

221
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,360
weren't for this fossil fuels problem we

222
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,120
wouldn't be here having this

223
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,839
conversation and it's also one of the

224
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,480
things that's most actionable as a

225
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,519
consumer I like to remind people that on

226
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,000
the heat side you know there's this

227
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,440
mythology that we've all grown up with

228
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,958
that natural gas is a clean burning fuel

229
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,560
but the truth is the more we learn about

230
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,239
it it's simp similar or potentially even

231
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,639
worse than coal in terms of its climate

232
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,720
impacts because of methane leaks it's a

233
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,679
major source of air pollution which is

234
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,680
virtually uh invisible to people and

235
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,919
it's also true that renewable natural

236
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,359
gas although it's getting a lot of

237
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:17,039
airPlay from the utilities is not going

238
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,600
to save the day here there's no such

239
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,480
thing as renewable methane and it's not

240
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,399
equivalent to renewable energy because

241
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,240
it's it still has massive environmental

242
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,519
consequences so the bad news is we have

243
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,000
to get off of this thing that we've

244
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,720
grown up with in which has been

245
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,440
important to building civilization for

246
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,879
the last 100 years but the good news is

247
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,240
there's an alternative that here that is

248
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,919
incredibly sustainable and is hugely

249
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,039
economically advantageous the cost of U

250
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:48,479
creating new energy with uh solar and

251
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:50,439
wind is now lower than any other source

252
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,360
and this is true all over the world to

253
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,800
varying degrees um because of local

254
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,440
economics but on a macro level this is

255
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,120
absolutely the case which is one of the

256
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,959
reasons why we are going to go here but

257
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,360
the of course we need to go here as fast

258
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,399
as possible but this is another story

259
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,680
that wouldn't have been true 20 or 30

260
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,399
years ago would have made this

261
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:11,278
conversation impossible to have the

262
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,440
other thing that's been having happening

263
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,879
sort of quietly behind the scenes is

264
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,839
that electric appliances have become

265
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,078
unbelievably more energy efficient in

266
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,560
our lifetime I like to point out these

267
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,599
minimum efficiency standards from the US

268
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,159
government so basically if you look at

269
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,639
this you'll see that gas furnaces and

270
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,240
water heaters and all gas technology

271
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,919
they're required by law to be 2% more

272
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,639
energy efficient than they were 30 years

273
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,439
ago this technology literally hasn't

274
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,958
changed since the time of your parents

275
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,399
buying these devices when we were

276
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:42,919
children but electric devices and

277
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,078
particularly those that can uh include

278
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:49,599
heat pumps are by law at least 30% more

279
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:51,879
energy efficient than they were 30 years

280
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,079
ago and in actual fact if you look at

281
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,720
the the devices that we buy they're more

282
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,039
like 50 or 60 or 70 or 100% more

283
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,000
efficient than the things that we would

284
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:02,919
have been buying 30 years ago and this

285
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,600
is true for anything that's electric um

286
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:06,879
the electric light bulb is kind of the

287
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,480
poster child for this um but these

288
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,958
devices that we'll talk about in terms

289
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,519
of homeowners in particular all have

290
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:16,159
massive efficiency benefits that are not

291
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,560
possible on the gas side that is one of

292
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,159
the reasons why if you look at energy

293
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,278
consumption in the United States at a

294
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,639
macro level it's essentially unchanged

295
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:27,240
in the last 20 years even though our

296
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,680
population is increased by 18% we have

297
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,799
51 million more people living here here

298
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,199
our homes are bigger they're almost

299
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,838
twice the size that were being built um

300
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,399
20 years ago there's 15 million heat

301
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,120
pumps that didn't exist two and a half

302
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,600
million EVS consuming electricity didn't

303
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,959
exist all these data centers that are

304
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,278
suck up huge amounts of electricity it

305
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,879
didn't exist 20 years ago and all all

306
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:52,559
these other devices like smartphones and

307
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,399
computers etc why is this that our

308
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,559
electricity consumption is flat even

309
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,919
though we've added all this these cons

310
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,039
these consumption it's because of the

311
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,159
effic Effy that we're seeing with the

312
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,480
electric devices and this has not played

313
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:07,639
itself out there is way more efficiency

314
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,120
to be gained which is why I'm not

315
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,000
concerned about this sound bite that

316
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,440
people say oh there's not not enough

317
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,799
electricity to go around we need more

318
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,360
supply for sure but it's not as dramatic

319
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,319
as people think and the other thing that

320
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,240
is important for people to realize is

321
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,959
that while our electricity supply has

322
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,720
been relatively constant the emissions

323
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,958
from electricity go down and down and

324
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,600
down as we add more Renewables all the

325
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:36,399
time and get rid of really um polluting

326
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,800
coal plants Etc this is why at a macro

327
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,919
level this story about electrification

328
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,000
is so compelling and why you hear this

329
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,000
sound by that we should be electrifying

330
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,639
everything and you know we've been sort

331
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,360
of talking about it primarily from a a a

332
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,000
climate change perspective but it has

333
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,120
these other benefits that are almost too

334
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,759
good to be true energy cost savings that

335
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,480
we'll talk about it is it think about

336
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,120
where air pollution comes from for the

337
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,480
most part it comes from burning fossil

338
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,519
fuels that's the the major source of air

339
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,159
pollution it's a huge consumer of water

340
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,919
so that fresh water so we'll have more

341
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,198
available flesh water if we get off of

342
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,198
fossil fuels production this all leads

343
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:15,039
to healthier people and a stronger

344
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:17,399
economy so lots of reasons that the

345
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,278
macro level to be excited about this but

346
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,198
I also think it's important to use this

347
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,159
context Framing and what it means

348
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:24,958
personally because you can be thinking

349
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,360
about that and go oh that's great well

350
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,958
what about me well in my home in most

351
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,600
people's homes 60 % of the carbon

352
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,919
emissions that we're responsible for as

353
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,120
individuals comes from burning fossil

354
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,559
fuels and it's actually very possible to

355
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,879
eliminate all that which we'll talk

356
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,439
about whereas the other 40% which comes

357
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,600
from the food you buy and the things

358
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,600
that you purchase that's harder to get

359
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,639
rid of I mean that is takes other people

360
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,879
to do that for us but we can take care

361
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,600
of this ourselves the four biggest ones

362
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,399
in most people's lives are their

363
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,399
electricity Supply their gas cars their

364
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,958
furnaces and their water heaters these

365
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,919
are the four biggest sources of uh

366
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,719
carbon pollution for any individual the

367
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:07,838
only thing that would be on part of this

368
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,800
is if you fly a lot um that would be up

369
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,959
there but for most people these things

370
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,799
make everything else pale in comparison

371
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:16,198
from a carbon emission standpoint and

372
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,879
the exciting thing is that when you

373
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:20,039
combine renewable energy and

374
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,120
electrification all these things can go

375
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,719
to zero and it's possible to do this

376
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,320
today you can get renewable en energy

377
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,519
into your home there's multiple ways to

378
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,120
do that you can get an EV and charge it

379
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,519
with that renew energy now you're

380
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,959
creating zero emissions for your

381
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,360
transportation same for your heating and

382
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,838
your water heating and there's economic

383
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,519
benefits to these two that we'll talk

384
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,360
about because when you roll this all up

385
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,519
what you see is that at a household

386
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,360
level the average in the US is about 20

387
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,560
tons of carbon emission if you Electrify

388
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,919
that home today with the grid as it is

389
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:56,078
no renewable energy more than we have

390
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,360
already you would slash those carbon

391
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,039
emissions

392
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,039
dramatically but if you

393
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:03,759
in add this renewable energy thing which

394
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,879
is possible to do at an individual level

395
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,800
and it's where we're headed as a country

396
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:11,439
a lot of states have laws now that

397
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,879
require this by very near future um this

398
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,440
is where we're headed that this home

399
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,360
would go from 20 to zero and along the

400
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,079
way save amazing amounts of money in

401
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,320
terms of energy costs it costs about

402
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:25,958
$7,000 a year to run a home on average

403
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,320
if you think about your electric bill

404
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,039
your gas bill and the gasoline

405
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,319
consumption for two cars which is

406
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,439
average that can be cut in half nearly

407
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:36,838
by electri

408
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,920
electrifying so of course it's important

409
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,519
to educate people about the technologies

410
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,439
that make that possible and we we're not

411
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,198
going to be spending as much time on

412
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,560
that today but this is one of the things

413
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,278
that I think is really important for my

414
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,958
work is just to make these things

415
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,240
familiar to people because while they're

416
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,758
not necessarily new most people are not

417
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,839
familiar with these technologies that

418
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,519
are fundamental to the electrification

419
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,279
movement and that each of them have

420
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,600
their own benefits which you can talk

421
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:04,519
about it's it can feel daunting we like

422
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,680
to try to keep it simple for people by

423
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,560
tell showing them how they can clean up

424
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,479
their electric supply and then thinking

425
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,879
about all the things in your home that

426
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,399
burn fossil fuels from your your

427
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,919
lawnmower which we'll hear more about

428
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,278
today I'm excited it's one of my pet

429
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,039
peeves all the way to um you know your

430
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,600
furnace Etc all those things can be

431
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:23,639
replaced with electric Alternatives that

432
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,319
are better you you can Electrify your

433
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,240
transportation and then of course

434
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,679
there's a Justice component to all this

435
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,959
we have to Electrify everyone we'll be

436
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,799
hearing more about that today from

437
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,159
another speaker which is I like to

438
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,479
remind people that's a certainly

439
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:38,439
important part of this okay so back to

440
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,079
this like climate action versus personal

441
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,920
benefit thing if you talk about heat

442
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:45,799
space heating for and heat pumps the

443
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,879
fact is that these devices are going to

444
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:49,120
make you more comfortable many homes

445
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,078
don't even have air conditioning it

446
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,639
comes along for the ride in this case if

447
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,838
you replace your furnace with a heat

448
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,240
pump but it also provides more

449
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,680
consistent air uh temperatures there are

450
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,440
more well spaced out in your home so you

451
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,638
don't have as many cold spots Etc

452
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,279
because it operates at a lower level of

453
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,160
energy but more continuously and that

454
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:10,359
also means you get better air quality

455
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,038
that more air through your filters Etc

456
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:14,159
that's noticeable in homes that are

457
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:16,400
heated with heat pumps but from an

458
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,400
economic standpoint it's the cheapest

459
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,759
way to heat your home there's just no

460
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
other technology that competes with this

461
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:24,439
you know you're the difference between a

462
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,839
gas furnace and the heat pump will vary

463
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:30,279
from place to place and home to home but

464
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:33,159
in general it is the lowest cost way to

465
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,558
um heat your home and by far the lowest

466
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,279
um carbon pollution I like to point out

467
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:39,839
to people because this is another myth

468
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,480
you do not need gas backup even in very

469
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,199
cold parts of the country it's possible

470
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,480
to Electrify homes Alaska Maine it's

471
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,880
happening um with these new efficient

472
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,759
versions of heat pumps that can operate

473
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,600
at very low temperatures and of course

474
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,558
if you have electric uh a renewable

475
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,519
energy unit home or this is what's going

476
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:59,839
to happen in the future these devices

477
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,519
that are electric will produce no carbon

478
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,639
emissions and that's just not possible

479
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,720
to do with the other

480
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,840
Technologies a lot of people may say

481
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,839
well this is a new thing you know like

482
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,759
am I going to be like the first person

483
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,720
doing this if I do this in my home and

484
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,558
the truth is that Americans are waking

485
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,279
up to the fact that electrification is a

486
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:19,720
good thing and heat pumps are just

487
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,720
better this is data about sales of heat

488
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,720
pumps in the US and you can see that

489
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,038
five years ago furnaces were massively

490
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,360
outs selling heat pumps and that's

491
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:30,599
completely turned around in 2024 it's

492
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,399
more like 60% sales are are heat pumps

493
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,319
so super exciting if you do this you're

494
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,519
not alone you're part of this trend

495
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,960
that's developing around embracing these

496
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,720
Technologies most people think that they

497
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,000
understand electric vehicles they they

498
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,640
they think they're just expensive um and

499
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,240
maybe a little bit better but the truth

500
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,919
is they're safer there's fewer

501
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,640
fatalities associated with electric

502
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,759
vehicles they perform better in every

503
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,880
way and they have these dramatic cost

504
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,519
savings that make the sticker price that

505
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,400
you might be um worried about pale when

506
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:01,158
you

507
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,919
or basically go away as an issue when

508
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:04,360
you look at total cost of ownership over

509
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:06,960
five years you'll save thousands of

510
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:08,599
dollars and it's because of this fact

511
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,440
these are two cars that are essentially

512
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:13,439
the same cars one's a gas and one the

513
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,960
other's electric and you can see you get

514
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,679
for $10 of fuel you can go three times

515
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,600
as far with the electric version that is

516
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:23,000
why over the lifetime of this car you're

517
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:25,079
going to save a ton of money as well as

518
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
massively reduce your carbon emissions

519
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,558
and of course all that can be zero if

520
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,519
you're charging R renewable en energy

521
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:34,319
and this is why again people are waking

522
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,798
up to this and so last year EVS were

523
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,759
about 8% of sales here in Oregon it's

524
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,200
more like 17 so you won't be alone if

525
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,879
you do this and I would just finally

526
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,159
like to end by saying I think it's

527
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,679
always important to give people idea

528
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:51,320
about resources they can turn to to help

529
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,919
them to do this in their own home these

530
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:55,399
are three really good ones that I use a

531
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,000
lot but of course it depends on where

532
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,880
you live and then finally you know

533
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,200
electrification is just better yes it's

534
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,640
a powerful climate action yes it's going

535
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,080
to give you personal benefits but it's

536
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,520
just better and that's why more and more

537
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:13,319
people are waking up to this and and by

538
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,918
doing this you can be building your part

539
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,918
of a better

540
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:24,000
future okay thank you um I think that's

541
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,440
uh all I have and I don't know if we

542
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,960
have a couple minutes for questions

543
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,159
here I I was trying to talk about to get

544
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,720
through that there's a lot of material

545
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,960
to cover but I hope Brian what is what

546
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,120
is the most exciting thing for from your

547
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,319
frame of reference about what

548
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:46,000
electrification can do for

549
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:48,240
us well I think the the most exciting

550
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,720
thing about it is this sort of no

551
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,159
compromise um aspect of it that you know

552
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,480
because I think people are used to this

553
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:55,919
idea that if you want to do something

554
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,558
that's good for the planet you have to

555
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,120
sacrifice somehow and I I think I I

556
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:05,879
applaud that idea of living smaller and

557
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:08,119
consuming fuel resources for sure but I

558
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,880
I you can I think it's fair to say that

559
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:14,959
that idea has not been successful in the

560
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,080
world in general as a as a as a solution

561
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,480
to our problems you know people don't

562
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,359
want to sacrifice so what I love about

563
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,360
electrification is it's a little bit of

564
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,399
a cake and eat it your cake and E it to

565
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,079
kind of solution from the standpoint

566
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,278
that it's it's the most powerful climate

567
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,240
action that people can take period there

568
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:35,919
is nothing else like it in terms of how

569
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,599
much impact it has and it doesn't really

570
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,559
come along with any kind of major

571
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:42,439
sacrifices and really not really any

572
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,480
Behavior change you know I think that

573
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,360
that's the other thing that I I I talk a

574
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,960
lot about is that people don't like to

575
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,558
change your behavior but you know an NA

576
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,840
isn't a behavior change you're still

577
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:55,759
driving the way you used to it's just

578
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,798
that now you're you're creating fewer

579
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,640
Problems by um having access to person

580
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,200
mobility and yes you can have this whole

581
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,520
conversation about should we be

582
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,558
transitioning to more public

583
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:12,278
transportation yes 100% but it it really

584
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:14,000
solves problems that people um have in

585
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:16,319
terms of just being able to kind of do

586
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,558
what you're doing but in a way that

587
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,038
produces fewer Downstream issues and so

588
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:24,480
there's a lot of questions now in the

589
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:28,200
chat and they're all about uh losing

590
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,558
incentives or changes incentives or

591
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,319
maybe an increase in incentives with a

592
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:36,599
new Administration um what are your

593
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:38,639
thoughts about uh how important so

594
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,759
there's many questions

595
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,679
um um thinking from the federal to the

596
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,079
state level and the personal uh and

597
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:49,159
business level what are your thoughts on

598
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:51,158
are the incentives necessary do we need

599
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,720
to rely on them do you think they might

600
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:55,320
get bigger what do you think yeah well

601
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,319
Ian I think I'm as fearful as anyone

602
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:58,038
that you know we're going to lose

603
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,200
momentum on this that we've sort of

604
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:02,119
gained over the last five years with um

605
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,400
under the Biden Administration I think

606
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:06,959
they just don't get credit for how much

607
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,720
they did in an amazing way that we are

608
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,840
we still won't see the effects of it for

609
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:16,440
years still but I would say this trend

610
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,278
towards electrification started and

611
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,720
really started picking up some momentum

612
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:23,079
well before these incentives were

613
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,919
available so I think I'm not fearful of

614
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:28,798
it changing I I'm fearful of it slowing

615
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,200
down because and we don't have time for

616
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:34,558
things to slow down but um I also feel

617
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,759
like this is a time where the states are

618
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:41,519
going to have to step up um and do as

619
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:44,558
much as they can um to to plug the gap

620
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,319
between what is may start to deteriorate

621
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,879
at the federal

622
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,519
level okay so we need to switch there

623
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,240
are some questions if you want to answer

624
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,079
them in the chat and could you also put

625
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,000
the links that you showed on that next

626
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:00,519
to your last slide into the chat as well

627
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,440
Mark will you please share a screen and

628
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:04,759
come on board and while Mark is doing

629
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,278
that I just want to comment that my

630
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:09,558
87-year-old mom just bought an EV car

631
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:13,400
cuz her

632
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:15,720
22-year-old Corolla was dying and she

633
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,200
was fearful and it was without

634
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,079
incentives it was a really

635
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,038
inexpensive used car Chevy bolt and I'm

636
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:26,079
not trying to advocate for it I'm just

637
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:28,720
saying there's so many benefits to it

638
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,918
it's one of the most inexpensive car is

639
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,919
out there right now and it happens to be

640
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,799
electric and it happens to run off of

641
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:37,679
the solar on her roof

642
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:41,398
so I don't know I'm just saying it's

643
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:45,240
it's not high tech scary or expensive

644
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:48,119
okay Mark take us away well thank you so

healthy yard care it's clean it's quiet

652

purpose we've been in uh in existence

659
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:33,639
for about 12 years and our purpose is to

660
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:37,200
promote sustainability in lake ofo lake

661
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:40,840
ofo is a small suburb of uh Portland

662
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,960
Oregon Portland is a has a population of

663
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:46,278
about 630,000 and our population is

664
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,278
about

665
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:56,840
40,000 um people are so surprised uh to

666
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,038
find that um the utilization of gas

667
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:01,759
powerered Lawn Lawn equipment or

668
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:05,158
landscape equipment is quite detrimental

669
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:09,200
to our uh to our community and to our

670
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:12,080
climate uh one hour of uh running a gas

671
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:17,278
powerered lawn mower is equivalent to

672
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:21,759
running 300 miles um uh of a car going

673
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:25,200
from like LA to Vegas um and one hour of

674
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:28,519
leaf blower use uh is the equivalent of

675
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,120
uh driving 1100 miles or from LA to

676
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:34,079
Denver that's just absolutely amazing

677
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,558
mindboggling to my to my mind but it

678
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,599
does come from the California air

679
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:42,038
quality management board and is quite

680
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:47,240
believable and this is smog uh forming

681
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:50,119
pollutants all all comers um one of the

682
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:53,200
uh main disadvantages to gas powerered

683
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:56,519
landscape equipment is the extreme noise

684
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:01,278
uh noise um created by gas powered

685
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:04,558
landscaping equipment is is um equ uh is

686
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:07,119
uh about four times louder than

687
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:11,759
electric and

688
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:15,719
um when we look at deciel levels of uh

689
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:17,519
in in the environment uh it is a um it

690
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,480
is a a

691
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:23,679
logarithmic uh measurement which means

692
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,798
for every 10 Deb that you go up it's

693
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,278
twice as loud uh most uh electric

694
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:33,278
landscaping equipment runs at a deciel

695
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:35,398
level of about 55 to 75 um most gas

696
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:38,398
powerered landscape equipment run at

697
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:42,479
about 75 and go up to as high as

698
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:45,038
120 um on top of which um the gas

699
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,679
powerered landscape equipment has um has

700
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:52,278
a low pitched uh hum or uh sound that

701
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,720
penetrates walls and windows much more

702
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:58,679
efficiently than the higher pitch sounds

703
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,798
do and um can affect up to 9

704
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:05,559
homes whereas electric equipment it does

705
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:10,398
have some uh low pitch sound but uh it

706
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:14,440
can affect maybe six six homes um a a

707
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:17,119
deciel level above 85 can be harmful uh

708
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:22,919
when exposed to that over approximately

709
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:26,119
15 minutes uh so so OSHA EPA have uh

710
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:29,600
have put uh levels of which unprotected

711
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:32,278
ears should not be exposed to decel

712
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,798
levels um uh and you can see that down

713
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:37,159
at the

714
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:42,319
bottom um gas powered landscape

715
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:44,919
equipment uh exude a lot of toxins um uh

716
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:48,639
volatile organic compounds like Benzene

717
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:51,919
butane form Malahide um and also a very

718
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,799
dangerous uh particulate matter uh small

719
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:58,600
particulates called hydrocarbon uh PM

720
00:28:54,798 --> 00:29:01,720
2.5 that's the size electric landscaping

721
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:04,959
equipment doesn't exude any of that uh

722
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,519
when using the gas powered or blowers in

723
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,600
and of themselves they do stir up dust

724
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,000
and fecal matter and other stuff that's

725
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,839
on the on the ground and we'll talk a

726
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,398
little bit about how to avoid that in

727
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:19,398
the

728
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:22,719
future um looking at the comparing Gas

729
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:26,239
and Electric landscaping equipment uh

730
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,919
electric it's instant on and off uh gas

731
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,960
you got to pull a cord uh for starting

732
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,200
the engine you have to often we'll have

733
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,640
to prime it you have to refill the gas

734
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,679
and oil you got to you got to transport

735
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,759
the gas you got to fill the gas cans and

736
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:45,159
transport them often in your car uh so

737
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:47,919
it slushes around in the in the car and

738
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,559
with all the smell and uh in in there

739
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,679
whereas you don't have to do any of that

740
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:54,278
with electric you do have to charge

741
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,360
batteries and transport those batteries

742
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:59,798
uh but you don't have to winterize your

743
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:03,199
equipment with electric Landscaping

744
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:05,200
whereas if you don't winterize uh your

745
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,759
gas powered you're going to have a gummy

746
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,759
mess in the springtime and going to have

747
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:13,558
a and you're going to have a big Bill uh

748
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:16,158
cleaning it up uh annual maintenance of

749
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,639
spark plug changes air filter changes

750
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,840
fuel filter changes are all gone with

751
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,080
the electric landscape equipment um

752
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:25,839
multiple tools can be run on the same

753
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,359
battery so you don't have to buy

754
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:28,558
separate batteries for the different

755
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,319
equipment

756
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,119
um and batteries are becoming longer and

757
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:38,038
longer as far as the run times

758
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:41,759
go um I personally changed uh my gas-

759
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:43,640
powered G uh lawn uh equipment to

760
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,798
Electric several years ago and I

761
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:49,759
absolutely love my lawn it I it's

762
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:53,278
lighter it uh you turn it on you turn it

763
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:56,200
off there's no smell no no gases that

764
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:59,919
come out and and you have to deal with

765
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:04,880
uh and uh it's it's easier to push uh

766
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:06,720
it's all in all a plus uh to um uh for

767
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,960
your landscaping

768
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,440
equipment now you'll hear that they

769
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,200
aren't powerful enough for our

770
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,679
landscapers for our industrial

771
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:21,038
landscapers unfor fortunately many

772
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:24,519
companies are creating uh uh powerful

773
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:25,440
electric equipment uh anywhere from ego

774
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,720
to

775
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,120
Steel um to Makita and these have all

776
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,639
been field tested by AO which is the uh

777
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:38,119
which is the American green zone

778
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:42,479
Alliance U and are certified for our

779
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:46,479
landscapers for um uh for their

780
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,558
use now another another comment is that

781
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,000
uh the purchase price of the electric uh

782
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:54,960
the electric equipment is higher than

783
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,519
the gas and that is true um just like we

784
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,399
were talking about uh uh EVS being more

785
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,960
expensive than the the gas powered uh

786
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:07,759
models at this point although they are

787
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:12,319
going to be lower however um you'll note

788
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:16,319
that uh when looking at um uh the this

789
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:19,759
is just one brand steel uh the steel

790
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:24,079
br500 is a gas powerered blower and the

791
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:26,278
steel uh BGA 200 is a an electric and

792
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:30,480
you'll notice that the CFM is almost

793
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:33,159
identical uh you get little less uh uh

794
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,798
wind speed out of the electric than you

795
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:41,039
do from the gas but very very minimal

796
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:43,119
differences um and but again people say

797
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,519
that they are too expensive to replace

798
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:50,158
and operate uh when looking at the

799
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:53,120
economics of replacing gas uh gas

800
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,278
blowers with electric blowers we take

801
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:58,439
one example here of an electric blower

802
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:01,278
that cost about two grand

803
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,600
and we'll we'll give it we'll give the

804
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,798
landscaper the benefit of the doubt that

805
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,918
they have a gas powered blower now and

806
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:11,158
they're going to replace it with

807
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:14,600
electric so uh they they put out two

808
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:19,760
grand at the beginning um but in 10 and

809
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:21,240
a half months uh they you will find that

810
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,960
um the

811
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,079
electricity

812
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:30,000
um hold on one second here let me get my

813
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:34,278
pointer out yes you'll note here that

814
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,200
the steel 500 costs 5009 600 bucks and

815
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:39,319
the electric blower cost

816
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,159
$2200 oh my goodness okay but then you

817
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:44,798
look over the cost over five years

818
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:48,000
you're going to save a heck of a lot of

819
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,960
money with the electric um it costs

820
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,159
about

821
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:56,319
$113,000 to for your G gas El uh your

822
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,480
gas and your and your oil whereas the

823
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:03,798
electric

824
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:05,319
sorry about that um the electric uh this

825
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:08,800
includes your

826
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:13,039
electricity um so annualized cost is

827
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:18,320
about $500 for $600 for your electric

828
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:20,599
and $2,700 for your gas so over 10 10

829
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,800
and a half months you've actually paid

830
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:29,720
for your El your electric blower and uh

831
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,720
Savings of about $2,500 a year

832
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:38,159
another uh another uh penciling out of

833
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,119
uh costs we have a blower that costs

834
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,599
$2,500 here and we have a gas blower

835
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,960
that cost

836
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:50,838
$530 uh 2-year fuel cost um running at

837
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:55,199
1920 hours for um which is four days a

838
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:58,358
week four hours a day um uh with your

839
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:02,159
electricity cost about 384 bucks versus

840
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:05,039
the gas and the oil and the like uh 5600

841
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:07,440
so ultimately you're over two years

842
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:11,000
you're spending twice as much with your

843
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:15,280
gas blower than you are with your

844
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,400
electric so the next uh problem is that

845
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,000
they say is The Upfront costs are too

846
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,760
high so we're going to put our small

847
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,239
business owners out of

848
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,280
business so what we need to do is we

849
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:31,959
need to look at some sort of a financing

850
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:35,480
situ ation um we we know that equipment

851
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:38,079
is not paid for upfront all at once out

852
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,599
of pocket it's usually financed over

853
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,359
time so what we need to do is we need to

854
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:46,400
take a look at loans perhaps for our

855
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:49,759
small business people uh small business

856
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,838
administration has microloans we have in

857
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:57,359
Oregon we have a a new um a

858
00:35:53,838 --> 00:36:02,000
new uh loaning situation where where we

859
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:04,880
are are making microloans to landscapers

860
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,480
and for individuals who are uh

861
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:12,039
winterizing their homes um and we're

862
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,880
we're looking to to use that in our

863
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:17,440
small community too we also need to look

864
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,960
at Community grants uh for the small

865
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,639
landscapers and we also know that large

866
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,318
re retailers such as steel um often will

867
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:28,039
give interest free purchases and

868
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:32,000
payments over the course of time and as

869
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:34,880
you can see uh you pay for it with the

870
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,760
savings but people say oh they're still

871
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:42,000
too expensive I can't do

872
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:46,720
that what is what is the cost of

873
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:50,239
inaction the human cost uh we it expel

874
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:52,318
these things expel um toxins which can

875
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:56,159
cause cancer pulmonary disease heart

876
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:58,639
disease uh the the the deciel level of

877
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:02,399
these things cause hearing loss

878
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:06,118
um and we just don't want to we just

879
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:10,318
don't want to tolerate that so what can

880
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:12,318
we do as individuals and as groups uh to

881
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:15,599
alleviate this problem one is that we

882
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:18,400
can simply not use blowers um we can use

883
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,640
brooms and rakes we can buy electric

884
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,358
tools which are affordable as you've

885
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,598
seen they're affordable clean and

886
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:27,519
effective we can hire landscapers in our

887
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,318
in our area a lot of people have

888
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:32,519
landscapers and so we can hire

889
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:35,800
landscapers that who use Electric Tools

890
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:39,318
one of those uh we have a list and we've

891
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:42,200
worked with um quiet clean PDX uh to

892
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:45,358
create a list of uh landscapers who use

893
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:47,078
only electric equipment and it's very

894
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,039
difficult to get into them because

895
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:52,640
they're uh they're filling up uh we can

896
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:55,519
also buy our own Electric Tools at our

897
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:58,598
home and loan them to the landscaper so

898
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:01,079
the landscaper gives us the the labor

899
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:05,079
and we give them the tools to do the

900
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:08,760
work in our particular home um we can

901
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:11,680
also uh purchase batteries to charge at

902
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,359
our home and then they can own the

903
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,838
equipment and just change out the

904
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:20,679
batteries as they

905
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:24,358
come we can also uh care for our care

906
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:27,838
for our plants the xeri society has a uh

907
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:30,239
campaign for uh leaving the leaves

908
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:33,960
because uh they care for our soil and

909
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:36,000
plants um uh they avoid uh we want to

910
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,318
avoid herbicides and pesticides which

911
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,559
can be harmful to our children pets and

912
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:44,559
Wildlife and we can leave these leaves

913
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:48,078
which actually builds the soil uh builds

914
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:50,279
mulch we clean the hardscapes but leave

915
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,119
the leaves in the

916
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,839
Planters you can also take action and

917
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,838
become involved in local and National

918
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:04,199
groups uh that are uh working toward um

919

questions that was wonderful

959
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:09,879
Mark um so I'm just curious Mark uh what

960
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:12,279
is your favorite difference from using

961
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,400
an electric landscaping equipment as

962
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,760
opposed to gas power like what is your

963
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,160
favorite like why what's the nicest

964
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,720
thing about

965
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:26,639
it I like the instant on and off uh and

966
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:30,000
the and not having to manage the gas

967
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:33,920
through the through the winter uh

968
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,599
we our usage drops at our home uh in the

969
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:41,760
wintertime of course and um even

970
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:44,160
utilizing stabil in in the gas U really

971
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,280
didn't help we always were we always

972
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:49,440
were all gummed up and it was always a

973
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,440
mess and it

974
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:55,118
smells um so Sarah will you start

975
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:58,480
sharing and I'll ask one more question

976
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,318
of you Mark um can you just talk about a

977
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,920
little bit how you're advocating for the

978
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:07,079
Landscaping businesses to uh to move

979
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,358
over to electric equipment because I

980
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,519
have to say I live in an apartment

981
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:12,799
building and I notice a big difference

982
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:15,199
between electric landscaping and gas

983
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,760
powerered landscaping equipment around

984
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:21,078
me well we're um we're actually going to

985
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,720
the end user we're going to people who

986
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:27,519
um who are hiring the landscapers and

987
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:30,679
encouraging them to go to electri

988
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:33,800
landscapers then we've reached out to

989
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:36,199
landscapers in general find out if they

990
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,519
have the option for electric and then we

991
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:41,759
put it on our website um we're also look

992
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:44,880
working we're also beginning to work

993
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:49,040
with seeds for soul which is which is a

994
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:53,160
a funding a a low low interest um

995
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:55,039
funding group um to and we're just

996
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:58,279
beginning that process and we'll

997
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,679
probably work on that next year um

998
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,400
bringing bringing the community together

999
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:06,078
to

1000
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,480
um kind adopt a adopt a landscaper so to

1001
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,800
speak we we'll uh donate some funds

1002
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,400
we'll ask the city to donate funds and

1003
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,559
then we'll get some uh uh micro loans

1004
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,838
and between the three of us the three of

1005
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:25,839
them be able to help the the lowincome

1006
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:28,199
small landscapers uh uh weather the

1007
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:30,000
storm okay I just want to say that I'm

1008
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:32,919
going to put into the chat a cost

1009
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,199
comparison uh that nerta has done for

1010
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,240
greenhouse gas emissions and the cost

1011
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:39,838
for different kinds of equipment you

1012
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:42,879
kind of have to go onto the second tab

1013
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:45,199
of of the first link like it's going to

1014
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,240
download an Excel spreadsheet but it's

1015
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,000
really

1016
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:52,838
helpful very nice thank you thank you

1017
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,838
Sarah thank you

1018
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,960
Mark would you like me to take it away

1019
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,039
Jenny please

1020
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:04,720
great hi everyone um last speaker of the

1021
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,800
session for you my name is Sarah Brock I

1022
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:09,000
um run a program in New Hampshire that

1023
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,559
we call the energy circuit writers

1024
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,400
program and I'm going to explain what

1025
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:17,599
that is it's a way through which we are

1026
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:20,000
trying to help uh funds and action get

1027
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,440
into our more rural communities in New

1028
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,920
Hampshire we are fairly rural State um

1029
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,720
and part of the reason I'm here is

1030
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,920
because Jenny's mom is on one of the

1031
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:30,799
energy committees I work with in veral

1032
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:34,960
New Hampshire so happy to represent the

1033
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,960
Northeast here just a

1034
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:44,239
sec so um clean energy New Hampshire is

1035
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:46,159
a nonprofit uh we are uh striving

1036
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:48,199
towards a decarbonized Energy System for

1037
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:50,078
New Hampshire for us that means that we

1038
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:53,159
work on anything related to renewable

1039
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:58,039
energy Energy Efficiency and

1040
00:44:53,159 --> 00:45:00,799
electrification we have a North star

1041
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:02,960
that relates to equity um we haven't

1042
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,800
talked a lot about that today but the

1043
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,358
the three sentences that are run through

1044
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,960
my mind all the time are these guiding

1045
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:11,480
principles that um rates and costs must

1046
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,880
be affordable for all that uh the system

1047
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,679
should distribute the burdens and

1048
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,559
benefits um economic and and

1049
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,000
environmental burdens and benefits

1050
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:22,400
fairly and that the Energy System should

1051
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,880
be secure and resilient and

1052
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,639
reliable um we have I run our education

1053
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,440
Outreach technical assist

1054
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:32,239
side that's our energy circuit writer

1055
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,159
team we also do a lot in policy advocacy

1056
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:37,078
and and stakeholder engagement and we

1057
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:39,759
have a whole lot of members um across

1058
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:43,519
the state individuals industry members

1059
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,280
municipalities planners and we are you

1060
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:47,358
know relatively small state and we we

1061
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,680
sort of are the organization focused on

1062
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:52,759
this we don't have many other

1063
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:55,000
peers my team uh the circuit writer team

1064
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,400
provides direct Hands-On technical

1065
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,920
assistance to communities this is a

1066
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,639
program that started in the North

1067
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,440
country of New Hampshire you can see

1068
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,719
Melissa here who's our original circuit

1069
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,679
writer the concept was that a lot of the

1070
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:09,838
the communities particularly in our

1071
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:12,598
Northern um region are very small we're

1072
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:15,960
talking like 500 residents or a thousand

1073
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:18,720
or500 residents uh a thre member

1074
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,639
volunteer select board running the town

1075
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,318
and maybe a part-time administrator

1076
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:27,679
opening the mail and you know processing

1077
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:30,000
taxes so uh no capacity to help the Town

1078
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:33,078
put LEDs in town hall or consider a

1079
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,639
solar project or um or any of of those

1080
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:36,559
other projects that we were seeing some

1081
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:39,000
of the more populated towns be able to

1082
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:42,160
tackle so we got some Grant finding we

1083
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,760
hired someone to be a traveling staffer

1084
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:45,879
who could provide some expertise and

1085
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,920
some project management support and that

1086
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:52,039
was incredibly successful we managed to

1087
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,920
expand that to four municipally focused

1088
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:56,079
circuit riders that are each live and

1089
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,119
work in their regions so you can see the

1090
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,160
North country we call the Sea Coast in

1091
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:02,160
the Southeast and then a couple of those

1092
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,679
counties in the southwest now each have

1093
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:05,879
someone on the ground working out of

1094
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,679
their home that is going to select board

1095
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,720
meetings and planning board meetings and

1096
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:12,919
um creating energy committees and trying

1097
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:14,959
to get projects done that save money for

1098
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:18,000
the town and therefore trickles down

1099
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:21,119
into the tax base

1100
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,199
um the concept here in in the work that

1101
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,760
we do which started with municipalities

1102
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:27,199
and you as you'll see has grown um

1103
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,839
really has to do with the rural nature

1104
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,358
of our state we experience some of the

1105
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,000
highest energy burden in the nation

1106
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:36,239
because we don't have access to natural

1107
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:40,519
gas we're very reliant on Oil and

1108
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:43,159
Propane to heat our homes um and cold

1109
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:44,559
climates mean heat pumps were slow to

1110
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:46,639
take off although we are certainly

1111
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,480
seeing a lot more adoption of heat pumps

1112
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:50,879
for primary heating now which I'm

1113
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,199
thrilled about um we also just have very

1114
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,358
small communities which means at the

1115
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:57,399
municipal level very little capacity to

1116
00:47:55,358 --> 00:48:00,558
get projects done but also very little

1117
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,519
capacity to get um the word out about

1118
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,119
programs that could help residents to

1119
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:07,000
take action and we see programs rolled

1120
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,960
out in the state that just don't get

1121
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,239
Beyond populated a couple of populated

1122
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:16,119
centers in our

1123
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:19,000
state so our team effectively is Bridge

1124
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:21,358
um we identify what the programs are we

1125
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,440
develop the the technical expertise and

1126
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:26,039
capacity internally and then We're

1127
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,000
translating and supporting our partners

1128
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:30,639
through these

1129
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,358
projects um briefly because you're not

1130
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,558
you're not here to talk about Municipal

1131
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:37,159
energy projects necessarily my team is

1132
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,480
trained to do anything and everything

1133
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:42,199
that's necessary to support a town

1134
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,599
through the process of identifying and

1135
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:46,399
then having the voters approve an energy

1136
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:49,240
saving project and a lot of those

1137
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,838
projects uh do have to do with

1138
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:55,078
electrification some way whether we are

1139
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:57,239
shifting um their electrical source to

1140
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:00,200
solar and that happens a lot um putting

1141
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:02,919
solar on the town hall or on the um the

1142
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:06,879
you know covered landfill sort of thing

1143
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:08,838
a lot of efficiency projects um a lot of

1144
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,599
increasing number of electric vehicle

1145
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:13,400
procurement and electric vehicle

1146
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:14,720
charging projects um but a lot of talk

1147
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,358
about

1148
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:19,399
electrification that's I'll Breeze

1149
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:22,159
through this but you can see sort of a

1150
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,400
glimpse of the kinds of things that we

1151
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,519
have

1152
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,160
touched um we also work with small

1153
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:31,400
business businesses this is relatively

1154
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:33,798
new we got a grant from USDA to provide

1155
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,639
technical assistance for businesses who

1156
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:39,039
could be eligible for the um

1157
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,480
renewable rural energy for America

1158
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:42,880
program renewable energy for America

1159
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,480
program one of those it's a program that

1160
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,079
allows small businesses and a producers

1161
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,318
in rural parts of the country which is

1162
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:53,480
most of my state to access currently 50%

1163
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:56,838
of project cost um for renewable energy

1164
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:59,400
and Energy Efficiency projects so we are

1165
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:01,519
out talking to business owners every day

1166
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,960
helping them navigate the process both

1167
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:04,679
of applying for the grant but then also

1168
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,760
just putting the project together

1169
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:08,960
generally and we deal with the same

1170
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,640
capacity issues where these are small

1171
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,440
business owners who who do not have the

1172
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:14,759
time of day to go researching and

1173
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,679
getting contracts with contractors and

1174
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,920
we're able to hold their hand through

1175
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:19,960
the

1176
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,920
process and here's just another

1177
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,920
spattering of the kinds of projects that

1178
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,280
we've been working

1179
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,960
on um when

1180
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,319
it comes to helping so so the inflation

1181
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,880
reduction Act was obviously um

1182
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:35,880
gamechanging for a lot of reasons I'm

1183
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,000
not going to talk about this but one of

1184
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,640
the most impactful from our work has

1185
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,400
been the elective pay program which for

1186
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:45,838
those of you who don't work with

1187
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:48,519
municipalities or nonprofits this

1188
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:50,679
allowed um agencies like municipalities

1189
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:53,280
and nonprofits that don't have tax

1190
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:55,879
burden to still access the clean energy

1191
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,640
tax credits through a direct payment

1192
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:01,798
from the IR RS that has meant that our

1193
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:05,118
communities and our nonprofits have have

1194
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:07,079
access to an unlimited um funding source

1195
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,599
that's non-competitive to help move

1196
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:10,400
projects along and that has been

1197
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:13,000
game-changing um there have been a

1198
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:16,318
number of other programs and funding

1199
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,280
often linking back to the IRA that um

1200
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,079
part of my or my organization's mission

1201
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,760
is to make sure those dollars land on

1202
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:24,280
the ground in New Hampshire some of our

1203
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,799
neighboring states have state agencies

1204
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,240
and like Federal funding Zars whose job

1205
00:51:26,798 --> 00:51:31,400
it is to make sure that all federal

1206
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:33,039
funding that could land in the state

1207
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,240
does um we don't have that in New

1208
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:38,838
Hampshire for various funny political

1209
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:41,118
reasons so uh my organization sort of

1210
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:43,440
tries to do that as best we can um when

1211
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,599
these funding sources come across we're

1212
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,280
we're analyzing what is it who's

1213
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,640
eligible do they know they're eligible

1214
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,000
what needs to happen and what kind of

1215
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,960
technical assistance do we need to

1216
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,119
deploy on the ground to make sure those

1217
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:57,480
dollars land in the hands of of the

1218
00:51:54,119 --> 00:52:00,680
folks who are meant to receive them and

1219
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,760
uh looking into the next year I I cannot

1220
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:05,480
speak to whether this is going to change

1221
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,119
her last week's election results but um

1222
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,000
in New Hampshire we've been anxiously

1223
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,680
awaiting our state department of

1224
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,880
Energy's um program to deploy the home

1225
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:16,838
electrification and Appliance rebates

1226
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,480
this is something that's um a nationwide

1227
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:20,639
program but every state has been asked

1228
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,960
to to come up with their own plan to

1229
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,519
deploy it in New Hampshire this was

1230
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,039
going to mean I was just looking at the

1231
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:28,679
dollars this is going to mean somewhere

1232
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:32,119
around 7 million Landing in our state

1233
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:35,598
which is a lot that will go directly to

1234
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,760
Residents um individual and users and

1235
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,640
some of that is specific to

1236
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,119
electrification and I think the part

1237
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:43,598
that my team is most excited about is

1238
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,559
rebates that will help purchase heat

1239
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,559
pumps um and other you know all the

1240
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:49,240
appliances you heard Brian talking about

1241
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:51,798
earlier there will be significant

1242
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:53,558
rebates for on a level that we haven't

1243
00:52:51,798 --> 00:52:55,159
seen that combined with a couple of

1244
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:57,319
other incentive programs that are coming

1245
00:52:55,159 --> 00:53:00,199
down the pike in New England should make

1246
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:02,119
it possible for us to go out and be

1247
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:04,639
delivering this electrification message

1248
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:08,000
that we heard Brian share we don't

1249
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:09,480
really have the um the structure to to

1250
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,880
do that well in New Hampshire and these

1251
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,880
rural communities so we have been

1252
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,519
working with our energy committees and

1253
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,798
our local Partners to think about when

1254
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:20,039
this lands how do we make sure that

1255
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:22,798
these programs which are designed to be

1256
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:24,480
utilized by low-income residents

1257
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:26,679
actually can we get those programs to

1258
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,000
those low-income residents and and hold

1259
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:29,919
through their hands through the process

1260
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,519
of actually utilizing them because we

1261
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,680
know from history that this these

1262
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:36,639
programs are difficult to deploy

1263
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:38,519
effectively in the populations that you

1264
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:40,318
want them to reach so we're thinking a

1265
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:43,358
lot about that proactively some of what

1266
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:45,279
we are doing right now um we have a

1267
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:48,639
funding tracker that we track with our

1268
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:50,400
partners as these programs come up um we

1269
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:51,920
are researching them and trying to

1270
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,480
identify who needs to know about them

1271
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,240
and who needs to go after them as a

1272
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,880
coalition we um have worked with

1273
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:01,679
Statewide Partners to make sure that

1274
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,480
when the partners in the state go after

1275
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:05,879
Federal funding that often it's it's

1276
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,358
ending up that my program is being

1277
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,640
tapped to as a wrin so that not only is

1278
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:12,719
the program being applied for but

1279
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:14,400
there's some money being set aside for

1280
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:16,318
technical assistance as part of the

1281
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,480
program rollout plan because we know

1282
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:21,159
that that's necessary in New Hampshire

1283
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,880
for these programs to be successful um

1284
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:25,000
we are really advocating with our

1285
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,318
communities to have shovel ready

1286
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,559
projects to put together so that means

1287
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:33,119
um figure out where in town the EV

1288
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,960
charger is going to go because you don't

1289
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,160
know when the grant program could land

1290
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,159
that would make money available to help

1291
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:40,558
you implement that but usually when

1292
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:42,159
Grant programs are announced for

1293
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,720
communities there's a six or eight week

1294
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:47,838
turn around which is not enough time for

1295
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:49,879
most small municipalities to come up

1296
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:52,239
with the idea get a contract with a

1297
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:54,480
vendor and put together a complicated

1298
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,759
Federal grant proposal so we're

1299
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,838
supporting communities and in developing

1300
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,520
folders of shovel ready projects so that

1301
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:03,719
they're ready to jump we are um forming

1302
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:05,039
and strengthening local volunteer energy

1303
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:07,598
committees and commissions which is a

1304
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:10,599
model that's very common in the

1305
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:13,280
Northeast where we have you know elected

1306
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:15,039
um in in New England we have these uh

1307
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,319
select boards that are elected in most

1308
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:20,039
towns and the select boards can appoint

1309
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:21,880
energy Committees of volunteers who then

1310
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:23,480
can go off and do the the busy work of

1311
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,480
putting together projects to then

1312
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:28,519
present to the voters at an annual town

1313
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,719
meeting so we create these committees we

1314
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:32,318
support them we help them do their

1315
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,480
homework for their select boards and

1316
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:36,199
their voters um we help those committies

1317
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,519
set up capital reserve funds so they

1318
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:40,199
don't have to wait till the next town

1319
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:42,639
meeting necessarily to take action on a

1320
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:44,919
clean energy project uh these are all

1321
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:48,838
somewhat unique veral New England

1322
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:53,200
problems but uh we were actively working

1323
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:55,358
um proactively to address them and then

1324
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:58,078
we're also doing some kind of uh

1325
00:55:55,358 --> 00:56:01,318
creative organizing on the ground um

1326
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,880
we've been uh working with some of our

1327
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:06,440
local partners and a local utility here

1328
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,838
to look at bringing batteries to local

1329
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,119
emergency shelters in some of our

1330
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:14,599
hilltowns where um where we can have

1331
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,200
prolonged outages and we put solar on

1332
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:18,079
these roofs and can we maybe rely on

1333
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:20,838
batteries instead of diesel to to

1334
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:23,079
provide back P backup power um we

1335
00:56:20,838 --> 00:56:24,838
started working with local libraries as

1336
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:26,920
hubs for information around

1337
00:56:24,838 --> 00:56:28,639
electrification uh the libraries are

1338
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,559
very interested they see this as a way

1339
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:33,159
to to have more reasons for people to

1340
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,880
come in the door um but they need

1341
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:36,519
partners because they are not experts in

1342
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,200
this so we're we're working with some

1343
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:40,920
libraries right now to to see what kind

1344
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:42,798
of programming we can help them run to

1345
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,119
get the word out about programs and

1346
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:47,440
electrification opportunities uh we've

1347
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:50,039
got some towns piloting a coaches

1348
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,960
project um rewiring America runs a

1349
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:53,160
coaching training and we've got some

1350
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,679
volunteers who have gone through that

1351
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:57,279
training and we've got a growing list of

1352
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:59,159
residents who have done some

1353
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,720
electrification on their own and are

1354
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:02,719
willing and excited about talking to

1355
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,558
their neighbors about it so we're

1356
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,480
standing up a program that's doing some

1357
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,720
matchmaking in that regard and and if

1358
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:11,880
that goes well that's something we're

1359
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:13,719
hoping to scale um we've been doing

1360
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,519
coordinated public Outreach campaigns in

1361
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:17,318
various communities for years uh the

1362
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,519
energy committee that Jenny's mom is

1363
00:57:17,318 --> 00:57:22,159
part of has done a lot of solariz and

1364
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:24,159
weatherized campaigns with um my help in

1365
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:27,399
the past and it's a model that we found

1366
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:29,078
really successful and uh we've been

1367
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,160
doing more work with resident owned

1368
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:32,559
communities which are um mobile home

1369
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:34,199
communities in New Hampshire we have a

1370
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,920
lot of those communities that are owned

1371
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:38,759
by their residents and um are

1372
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:41,440
increasingly looking at Community solar

1373
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,880
projects and electrification across

1374
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,039
their communities and we've got some

1375
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,200
grants to help with that so we're

1376
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:50,200
getting creative um to get these

1377
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:52,598
programs and these Solutions out into

1378
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:55,239
the hands of people who need them takes

1379
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:56,920
um a lot of coordination and effort and

1380
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:59,358
thoughtfulness at the level in my

1381
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:02,318
experience but uh there's a lot that can

1382
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:06,000
be done I'll leave it at

1383
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:09,358
that Sarah thank you so much I just

1384
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,400
admire your program so so so so very

1385
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:14,199
much you are connecting the dots in ways

1386
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,000
that are so important and as we think

1387
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:17,598
and especially for Rural communities

1388
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,599
because New Hampshire like the whole

1389
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:23,960
state is like a million people

1390
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:27,519
so um you have a a specific kind of

1391
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:29,358
place based learning collaboration and

1392
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:31,679
integration to connect the dots for

1393
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:36,400
funding and implementation

1394
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:38,838
so how can other places think about what

1395
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,680
you're doing how can they research and

1396
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:42,920
duplicate what you're doing in order to

1397
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:44,919
meet you know in Florida they'll have

1398
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,519
different kinds of problems in Oregon

1399
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,358
they'll have different problems in Iowa

1400
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:51,480
they'll have different problems like I

1401
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:53,920
just feel like you you're connecting the

1402
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:57,159
dots in important ways how can we how

1403
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,159
can we

1404
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:04,838
follow or be inspired or like how has it

1405
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:06,720
come together in your head to make these

1406
00:59:04,838 --> 00:59:09,519
kinds of things

1407
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:11,879
connect me I think um everything that

1408
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:15,519
I'm working on started with the question

1409
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:18,400
of uh what do we want to see and why

1410
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,719
isn't it happening the in circuit writer

1411
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,358
program was created because someone

1412
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:23,558
looked up at these little towns in the

1413
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:26,480
North country and said none of these

1414
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:29,440
towns has has switched out their street

1415
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,480
lights for LEDs why because it makes

1416
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:35,079
perfect Financial sense and it was just

1417
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:36,920
the the capacity and so we we identified

1418
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:38,480
the problem and we we tried it out we

1419
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,798
plugged the hole in a teeny little pilot

1420
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,159
it worked and so we expanded it um the

1421
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:46,119
solariz and weatherized programs were

1422
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:47,960
the same thing what why why is there a

1423
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:51,400
we got data from the state and it said

1424
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:53,599
that nobody on the coneticut river was

1425
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:57,599
subscribing to the New Hampshire saves

1426
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:59,200
program why and so we we put together a

1427
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,760
program and we talk to the installers

1428
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:03,639
who were wanting to do business there

1429
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:06,480
and we talk to the NH saves folks and we

1430
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:08,960
put together a program and we we changed

1431
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:12,358
this The Narrative and I think wherever

1432
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,838
you are in the country surely you have

1433
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:17,078
one of those why isn't this happening

1434
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:19,119
and get the people around the table

1435
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:20,760
who've got perspective on it including

1436
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,000
the folks you're trying to reach and

1437
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:26,520
come up with a solution that's worth

1438
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,519
trying at a scale that's possible to try

1439
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:32,599
David will you come on and ask your

1440
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:36,318
question sure thanks Jenny um and thank

1441
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:40,559
you Sarah and also Brian and Mark my

1442
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:43,199
question speaking as a member of the

1443
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:46,200
national extension climate initiative

1444
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:48,358
which uh is sponsoring this and

1445
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:51,759
represents the resources of the l Grant

1446
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:54,719
University system broadly speaking what

1447
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,720
what can we in the sort of bridging

1448
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:59,959
organization between community and

1449
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:03,159
Academy and the academy what can we do

1450
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:07,400
better that would help the work that

1451
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:09,759
you're doing uh in places uh on the

1452
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,480
ground more effectively and I'm also

1453
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,880
just curious whether any of you already

1454
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:17,960
have connections with Cooperative

1455
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,960
Extension people in your

1456
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,920
communities I'll just note briefly that

1457
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:26,280
in New Hampshire our extension runs a a

1458
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:29,159
nature groupy program that I just love

1459
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,400
it's a um a volunteer

1460
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:34,038
matchmaking program and I've talked to

1461
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,280
them at length recently about whether

1462
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:38,480
some of what they're doing to try to to

1463
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:40,920
tap volunteerism toward the end of

1464
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:43,920
conservation in their case um couldn't

1465
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:46,200
be sort of mirrored or or dovetailed

1466
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,039
with the idea of um developing some sort

1467
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:50,078
of coaching program or volunteering

1468
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:51,680
program around electrification and

1469
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:54,119
helping people access electrification

1470
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:56,838
resources and that I think there's

1471
01:01:54,119 --> 01:02:00,200
there's more to to be looked at there

1472
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:00,199
that's one area where we're seeing

1473
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:11,759
connection and L A sgo in losn we are uh

1474
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:14,400
connecting with uh with State and

1475
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,480
National groups uh we have a

1476
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,599
electrification action committee that

1477
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:22,199
we're um uh

1478
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:25,920
we're connecting with Electrify now and

1479
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:31,078
creating a a coaching uh electrification

1480
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:34,039
coaching group uh to help people

1481
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:36,880
Electrify yeah I mean I'm to be honest

1482
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:40,440
this I'm pretty unfamiliar with this

1483
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:43,358
extension um kind of concept and how how

1484
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:46,358
we might work better with them but I I I

1485
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:48,038
like the idea and I love the fact that

1486
01:02:46,358 --> 01:02:49,480
you know it feels like it's kind of

1487
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:53,160
embedded in communities all over the

1488
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:55,519
country which is such an important thing

1489
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:57,199
I think everyone here has been touching

1490
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:01,719
this speak speakers on this kind of

1491
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:03,879
local action idea that and you know the

1492
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:05,318
way local action works is by connecting

1493
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,039
well with the communities like Sarah

1494
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:09,679
spoke to that very eloquently I mean

1495
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:11,119
without people on the ground you can

1496
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:14,278
have the best programs in the world and

1497
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:17,680
they won't get any traction so I I don't

1498
01:03:14,278 --> 01:03:19,639
know I would love to explore it more I'm

1499
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:21,038
i' like to talk to you maybe and others

1500
01:03:19,639 --> 01:03:22,798
more about what that might look like

1501
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:25,200
because I'm pretty unfamiliar with what

1502
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:27,920
that extension program is this is I just

1503
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:30,598
sent you I just sent you a chat with my

1504
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:34,039
email address we can okay followall up

1505
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:37,278
then and anybody else is welcome as well

1506
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:40,119
so Colin has one question

1507
01:03:37,278 --> 01:03:41,838
uh um New York state has some similar

1508
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:45,039
programs called the re Regional clean

1509
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:46,719
energy hubs with a link um we have found

1510
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,760
that there's generally good awareness

1511
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:51,598
for various energy and cost savings

1512
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:54,039
programs but low participation what has

1513
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:57,160
been your program's best practices for

1514
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:58,920
moving someone from awareness to action

1515
01:03:57,159 --> 01:04:01,239
what's more important education and

1516
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:04,000
Outreach or program design and incentive

1517
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:07,000
structure dot dot

1518
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,838
dot um every time I've asked that

1519
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,838
question uh

1520
01:04:08,838 --> 01:04:14,798
Colin I it tends to be in a room um and

1521
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:17,920
I always like to have the contractors

1522
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:22,079
there and the program leader people

1523
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:24,720
design people there um and ideally some

1524
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:27,599
some just humans uh who fit in that

1525
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:30,078
category of of maybe the audience and

1526
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:33,680
then we just map it out start to finish

1527
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:37,000
um the path from awareness to action and

1528
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:39,278
every little place on that path where

1529
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,318
you could fall off or where something is

1530
01:04:39,278 --> 01:04:44,400
confusing and then um we we designed the

1531
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:46,318
program to smooth that and have an

1532
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,400
answer for every moment where it gets

1533
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:50,318
confusing so I've run I mentioned the

1534
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,760
solariz and weatherized campaigns but

1535
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:56,079
where I've had most success in in in

1536
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,440
getting uptick in an actual program it's

1537
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:00,640
when we like hyper analyze the program

1538
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:04,679
in that respect and pick a geography and

1539
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:06,199
pick some partners and um and run and in

1540
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:08,000
some of those cases we were we were

1541
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:10,519
negotiating with the contractors to to

1542
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,119
sweeten the deal a little bit uh and you

1543
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:14,239
know have an extra incentive or some

1544
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:16,318
discount and in some cases we were

1545
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,399
simply just promoting the program and

1546
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:20,880
and helping people feel better about

1547
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,480
participating and giving them a sense of

1548
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,920
now is the moment we're all doing it

1549
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,920
together in my community here and that's

1550
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,920
we're partnering with the energy

1551
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,240
committees and doing it a couple

1552
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:31,440
communities at a time was very effective

1553
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:35,118
but that skill made sense at the level

1554
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,119
that we were operating in rural New

1555
01:05:35,719 --> 01:05:40,558
Hampshire I will just add on that the

1556
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,358
reason I know Sarah is because she

1557
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,960
worked with my mom's town which is

1558
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:46,759
Cornish New Hampshire to have a

1559
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,199
competition with the neighboring town

1560
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,799
which is planfield New Hampshire to see

1561
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:54,118
who could weatherize more so there had

1562
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:55,759
little tickers you know like who was

1563
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:57,838
winning who was getting more and then

1564
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,278
they did the same thing with solarizing

1565
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:04,278
right like who had to who has more solar

1566
01:06:00,278 --> 01:06:06,599
panels and what happened was as they got

1567
01:06:04,278 --> 01:06:10,599
each Town had incentives because if the

1568
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:12,599
town got to 10 participants the cost of

1569
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:15,640
the weatherization or the solar panels

1570
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:17,519
went down if they got to 20 participants

1571
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:19,358
right the cost of the solar panels for

1572
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:22,400
everybody and for the weatherization

1573
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:25,038
went down and so not only did you get

1574
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,639
everybody to sort of cajo everybody else

1575
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:30,240
in but you also started getting

1576
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:32,679
everybody talking about the issues and

1577
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:35,278
finessing the problems and actually

1578
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:38,078
making a better product for everyone and

1579
01:06:35,278 --> 01:06:40,639
it was fun I mean we're talking towns of

1580
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,519
like 1400 people we're not talking about

1581
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:45,318
some huge thing like one building in New

1582
01:06:42,519 --> 01:06:47,559
York City has 1400 people and I can't

1583
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:49,239
get my building to like even put a solar

1584
01:06:47,559 --> 01:06:53,119
panel on our roof right I mean it's

1585
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:57,239
really hard but um it was so joyful and

1586
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:59,640
fun and silly and and real like I and I

1587
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:04,118
say silly with most

1588
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:07,199
endearing means I when I mean real like

1589
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:09,039
it was just so real and I just I just

1590
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:11,598
put that out there

1591
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:14,119
because because like Brian said in the

1592
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,440
beginning you know we we can take an

1593
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:19,358
austerity politic as the only way of

1594
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:22,599
getting through this or we can just

1595
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:25,598
improve our air quality improve our our

1596
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:27,920
our water quality improve our our

1597
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:30,880
efficiency and savings all of these

1598
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,920
things like like why are we resisting it

1599
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,720
which is my

1600
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:37,358
question ultimately for all of us but

1601
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:38,798
does anybody else want to give their

1602
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:41,679
perspective I totally went off and a

1603
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:46,079
should of end we are overtime but I feel

1604
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:48,480
like this group is Rich um well I I do I

1605
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:50,278
would love to respond to that Jennifer

1606
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,719
real quickly because I I I feel and

1607
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:55,639
someone asked us in the one of the q&amp;as

1608
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:59,278
you know it's the like a lot of things

1609
01:07:55,639 --> 01:08:02,480
in this space The Upfront cost is often

1610
01:07:59,278 --> 01:08:05,400
the thing that is the hurt um and that

1611
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,358
that can that can take many different

1612
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,200
forms you know The Upfront cost might be

1613
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:12,119
scary when you're comparing it to a

1614
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:13,558
lower cost fossil fuel piece of

1615
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:14,880
equipment that's going to cost you more

1616
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:16,719
over the life of the product but The

1617
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,960
Upfront cost is lower that's one

1618
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,600
impediment another impediment is

1619
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,480
particularly if you're talking to more

1620
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,199
of the um another version of that if

1621
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:26,039
particularly for lower income folks it's

1622
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:28,599
like

1623
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:30,960
wow like the idea of a new water heater

1624
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,640
is just like so not in the cards because

1625
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,439
they're trying to keep food on the table

1626
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:38,359
so those upfront costs just become like

1627
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:40,278
completely showstoppers so I kind of

1628
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:42,239
feel like the incentives were one take

1629
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:45,799
at this the IRA the whole idea of the

1630
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:48,000
IRA was that at the least it the um the

1631
01:08:45,798 --> 01:08:50,960
very least it would encourage people to

1632
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,640
buy more efficient equipment um which is

1633
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,600
going to be better in the long run but

1634
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,359
in the best case scenarios you these

1635
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,279
more efficient versions of heat pumps

1636
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:02,719
and other devices are competitive with

1637
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:04,120
gas equipment or or fairly close because

1638
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,039
of those upfront incentives so that was

1639
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:08,079
one way to get at it but the other way

1640
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:10,439
that I just still scratch my head about

1641
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:12,519
like why this isn't more of a thing is

1642
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:15,119
financing because if you think about

1643
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:17,199
nobody buys a car with cash you know I

1644
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:19,399
mean almost everyone finances their cars

1645
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:21,238
when they purchase them and that's why

1646
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:22,679
it's relatively easy to buy these

1647
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:24,919
expensive devices because you're

1648
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:27,079
spreading the cost out over time and

1649
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:29,520
it's just weird to me that there isn't

1650
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:30,759
more like prevalent examples of that I

1651
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,920
think that the number of people who

1652
01:09:30,759 --> 01:09:37,198
actually Finance their um HVAC equipment

1653
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:39,039
is teeny it's really small um why is

1654
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,559
that it's weird these things cost almost

1655
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:43,039
as much as an automobile and yet people

1656
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,600
have to pay cash for them it's crazy so

1657
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:48,719
I I that's another Frontier I would love

1658
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,359
to try to crack the code on somehow

1659
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:54,719
Sarah you probably have more experience

1660
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:57,480
with that um but yeah upfront cost

1661
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:59,800
that's a big heard of just to underscore

1662
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:01,839
the the weird aversion to financing I've

1663
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:05,560
been seeing that for a decade and I

1664
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:07,440
think until it can be as easy as on bill

1665
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,760
um that's where I've started to see and

1666
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:10,319
you know I used to do some work in

1667
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:12,679
Vermont and Green Mountain Power over

1668
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:14,759
there did did a great job building some

1669
01:10:12,679 --> 01:10:16,199
of this into their rate structure and

1670
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,360
that's when they really started to see

1671
01:10:16,198 --> 01:10:20,678
the adoption but it was years of having

1672
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:22,279
great programs through the local banks

1673
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:26,600
just no

1674
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:29,158
uptake yeah I can I just also mentioned

1675
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:32,000
uh uh as a resource there's a really

1676
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:35,039
Dynamic group of family consumer science

1677
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,399
Educators in extension that pay

1678
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:40,359
attention to household Finance they're

1679
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:43,000
not going to solve the problem by

1680
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:45,319
creating the new Financial tools but

1681
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,479
they are a really good group to help

1682
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:51,399
people understand what tools do exist

1683
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:53,519
that might that might um from the

1684
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:56,960
consumer side make it easier for people

1685
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:59,159
to understand the benefits of going uh

1686
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,840
this kind of Route

1687
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:04,920
so Dave did you put a link on that did

1688
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,600
you say I'm looking for it I don't have

1689
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,399
it right here yet I have not put a link

1690
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:11,440
but I will if if I can before Jenny

1691
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:13,719
shuts us down

1692
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:15,399
so and if not I'm gonna talk to you

1693
01:11:13,719 --> 01:11:18,319

uh I I hope everybody knows that you can

1698
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:35,840
contact me with ideas of things that you

1699
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:38,039
want to be presented next um because we

1700
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:41,279
are trying very hard to get multiple

1701
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:45,439
voices in order to cross fertilize and

1702
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:47,559
and innovate as well as Implement so um

1703
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:51,479
be sure to send me an email and you can

1704

crew um uh and there's many different

1706
01:11:55,039 --> 01:12:00,079
ways to participate um but more

1707
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,840
important than joining necki is figuring

1708
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:04,880
out how to make this happen in your own
