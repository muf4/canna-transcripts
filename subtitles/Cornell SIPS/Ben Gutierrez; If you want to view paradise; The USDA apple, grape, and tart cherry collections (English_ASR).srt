1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,359
University well welcome I'm so glad this

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,280
is a lot more people than I expected I

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,000
think the last time I did a talk here it

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:20,919
was like two people like during that the

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,600
peak Zoom time but um this again this

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,439
talk does work so much better if we're

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,679
standing in the Orchard and I can like

9
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,560
do the Willy Wonka like look at Paradise

10
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:30,559
like look at this beautiful diversity

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,238
collection so you're so close

12
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,960
you're like so close to Paradise

13
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:38,439
Geneva's not far like we do tours Public

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,558
tours um Marvin like we do lots of Tours

15
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:42,119
for Horticultural groups from Cornell

16
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,640
like take a chance to come up and see

17
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,759
and taste fruit and that that's really

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,039
how like germplasm is meant to be

19
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:51,640
interacted with and discovered um so I

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,559
am the the curator for the apple and

21
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,160
tart cherry collection I'm going to talk

22
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:57,799
about the grape collection that's up

23
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:00,599
there a little bit but I am I'm really

24
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:03,319
grateful for this opportunity let's see

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,519
here we go and of course like I'm the

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,599
only one talking today but this is all

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,200
like a a team effort really so we have

28
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:13,640
you know a a core of three scientists on

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,040
the team and and also Ganan zong who's

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,759
the research leader up there but like we

31
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,799
have tremendous expertise in in grafting

32
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,118
in chemistry in pathology um entomology

33
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,840
now with the new edition Michaela

34
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,719
Robertson and who can forget interns

35
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,240
right like this is kind of the highlight

36
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,280
of the job and I really like Advocate

37
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,640
strongly for anyone who's in the science

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,200
like Mentor as many as you can like find

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,040
your replacement right like we can't do

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,280
this job forever like you need to get

41
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,439
the the Next Generation motivated and

42
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,079
trained to kind of step in and take the

43
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:52,359
Reigns um so yeah we've done yeah maybe

44
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:55,519
23 interns now at my time starting in

45
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,680
2018 um and again this is like I think I

46
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,399
always give this quote and from Aldo

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,960
Leopold is like kind of my like the

48
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,320
philosophy that I try to like frame

49
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,599
frame all of that all of our discussions

50
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,318
in horiculture agriculture and when

51
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,799
we're talking to Broad audiences maybe

52
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:12,919
this isn't the audience for this quote

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,519
but I think this is useful in connecting

54
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,159
to the Next Generation to connecting

55
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:18,280
people who who don't think that they're

56
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,039
part of Agriculture but really there are

57
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,360
two spiritual dangers in not owning a

58
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,359
farm one is the danger of supposing that

59
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,239
breakfast comes from the grocery and the

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,360
other that heat comes from the furnace

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,519
and I do think that this part of New

62
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,640
York does a little bit better job at

63
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,159
that than than most of the country but

64
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,759
still there's a lot of work to do and

65
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,479
really like when you consider about 2%

66
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:41,359
of the US population is directly

67
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,518
involved in agriculture or ranching like

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,319
it's pretty it's there's a lot writing

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,800
on on the few that are are contributing

70
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,598
to this and this is this is how I feel

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,080
this is how maybe it feels to all of you

72
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:55,560
working in in your respective Fields

73
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,159
like we're Copus pushing this boulder up

74
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,840
the hill and like you know other fields

75
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,318
I don't feel like have this challenge

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,039
that we do right like if they never made

77
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,958
another smartphone I think we' we'd

78
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:07,840
adapt like we'd be fine it's not like

79
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,759
once they stop making smartphones we've

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,280
roll back to like the rotary phone right

81
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:15,000
but if we stop the research and the the

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,158
progress in agriculture there really is

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,878
a threat that we roll back production we

84
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:21,280
roll back that sustainability as new

85
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,840
pests new challenges emerge and like

86
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,519
really there's no end to what we need to

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,239
do right so really like passing that

88
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,280
Boulder off to the Next Generation so

89
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,000
that food security is like yeah not the

90
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,799
the pressing concern for our society

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,519
right like we can solve other societal

92
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,799
issues rather than just trying to feed

93
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,719
ourselves but not all doom and gloom

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,560
right like this is the other this is the

95
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,919
flip side getting to work in horiculture

96
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,039
is that there's a joy and there's like a

97
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,000
childlike you know wonderment at the the

98
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:53,318
diversity that's out there and the the

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,840
exciting Discovery so hopefully um so

100
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:57,078
this is not the original Willy Wonka

101
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,519
this is Tory mum who's our molecular

102
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,840
biologist and a talented um intern of

103
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,480
our did some nice Photoshop but um

104
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,560
actually I I do need to update this

105
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,518
because I mentioned that to an NPR inter

106
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,158
um in an NPR interview with Susan Brown

107
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,640
that Susan's kind of the Willy Wonka for

108
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,199
apples and they picked up on that and

109
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,238
published it now Susan Brown kind of

110
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,319
gets yeah teased a little bit for her

111
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:22,519
Willy Wonka but there's just there's a

112
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:25,079
joy and like there's mystery and some I

113
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:27,159
don't know impishness to like coming to

114
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,159
visit the the Jean Banks and tasting

115
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,720
weird flavors and yeah not not

116
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,199
everything will pass to you is is is

117
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,080
desirable and hopefully this group is is

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,639
well vered in in germplasm and I don't

119
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,319
know that there's like maybe a a course

120
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,680
or thing that like really hammers this

121
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,959
home but like what is germplasm and just

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
simply like bearers of heredity right

123
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,758
like these living resources that can

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,280
contribute to plant Improvement and it

125
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,240
can be any number of things modern

126
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,359
cultivars heirlooms land races crop wild

127
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,680
relatives like we do a lot of work with

128
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,038
those and I I think I highlight here the

129
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,680
the value of these prop wild relatives

130
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,000
cuz all like of the really exciting

131
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,360
traits that like you know I lose sleep

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,399
at night thinking about like how cool

133
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,479
some of these these traits are you know

134
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:14,879
the the disease resistance is huge for

135
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:16,758
sustainability but flavor like conquer

136
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,279
the the kind of the classic grape flavor

137
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,038
comes from a Wild Grape and what we

138
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,159
associate you know with the candy flavor

139
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,560
of grape really is like a wild trait

140
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,039
that is introgressed um strawberries

141
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,000
right like the production of

142
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,360
strawberries like that everbearing trait

143
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,038
comes from a wild um strawberry species

144
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,000
from Utah where I'm a native too so

145
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,079
really like getting excited about you

146
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,720
know bringing in the crop wild relatives

147
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:43,000
like the land races have a tremendous

148
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,919
history and story like this is the story

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,720
of uh of civilization told through

150
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:49,439
Agriculture and it's so important that

151
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,840
like not just speaking of them as tools

152
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,680
that we can use to to to make new Cult

153
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,679
of ours but really like preserving our

154
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,280
history and our culture um and really

155
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,439
it's this it's this balance right like

156
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:02,519
so the breeding pipeline is to like come

157
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,519
up with amazing cultivar but there's the

158
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,159
selection process really does narrow

159
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,680
down that and like really this is

160
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,599
showing the breeding I don't know if you

161
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,840
can see my

162
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:15,000
pointer is that coming through yeah so

163
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,198
like the breeding is leading upwards but

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,879
really like that's poor that's just poor

165
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,759
design like because the breeding cycle

166
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,120
is going back through each layer and

167
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,759
trying to bring in new traits and new

168
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,680
you know new what to maintain this broad

169
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,720
diversity because again no breeder worth

170
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,879
is his salt or his or her salt is going

171
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,520
to like breed themselves into a corner

172
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,360
especially for Apple breeding which

173
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:39,038
again the generation time like to be

174
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,080
able to Ingress new new traits and new

175
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,240
new germ plasm is going to set you back

176
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:46,399
quite quite a bit of time so always be

177
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,680
thinking like how can I maintain this

178
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,038
while trying to achieve you know a

179
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,079
broader and more you know broad

180
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:57,478
diversity and targeted releases for for

181
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,719
new cultivars um so yeah avoid the

182
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,240
bottlenecks um because that's really

183
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,960
kind of evident here when we do genetic

184
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,079
studies of our apple collection each

185
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,560
line represents the first degree

186
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:09,680
relationship and so in our diversity

187
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,519
collection of about 2,000 Apple

188
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,038
accessions you can see how everything's

189
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:17,240
kind of already intermixed and and

190
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:19,519
somehow related to one another um but

191
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,918
Apple because of its uh biology really

192
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,478
retains a lot of diversity but modern

193
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:27,000
cultivars really only have about eight

194
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,159
like progenitors that is like the found

195
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,038
like the effective population for Apple

196
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,039
that's kind of kind of

197
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:36,878
scary so I am part of the national plant

198
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:38,878
germ plasm system which is a USDA

199
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,080
program that has about 20 sites

200
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,960
throughout the US dedicated to crop

201
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:45,198
conservation Geneva is unique because we

202
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:49,239
are one of the original four that

203
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,240
started in the 1940s um so here's Geneva

204
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,560
here I'll highlight um again here's like

205
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,158
the overall Holdings of the the entire

206
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,199
program about 621,000

207
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:02,279
accessions and is again this isn't just

208
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,759
like a cool collection like an arc that

209
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,799
no one has access to this is like

210
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,879
broadly accessible for research and for

211
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,280
breeding and for commercial de

212
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,280
development so about 20 you know quarter

213
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,079
of a million samples go out every year

214
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,959
from ourg Banks and that's pretty

215
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,240
amazing and with our simple mission of

216
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,399
acquire preserve characterize and

217
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,478
distribute these genetic resources um I

218
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,719
do love this quote by the geneticist of

219
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,639
Francois Jacob uh diversity is a way of

220
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,639
coping with the possible it acts as a

221
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,959
kind of insurance for the future and

222
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,399
when people get excited about talking

223
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,718
sustainability and how do we like

224
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,278
preserve you know agriculture for the

225
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,159
future that genetic diversity is a part

226
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:44,838
of that

227
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,120
solution so our Gene Bank does look a

228
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,399
lot different than maybe what you've

229
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,240
seen like I know Denise like has a lot

230
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,399
of experience working in like in like

231
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,399
the classic G bank but here is our G

232
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,799
bank and it's really like not preserved

233
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,200
at like not protected at all like so we

234
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,838
have deer issues isues we have disease

235
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,120
management problems just because these

236
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,279
are field-based

237
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,240
Collections and you can see we do have

238
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:13,639
you know a substantial diversity of

239
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:16,120
apple and uh 56 species with about 4,400

240
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:17,439
um accessions in there making at one of

241
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,639
like the world's largest and most

242
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,240
diverse genetically in the world which

243
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,759
is really exciting the grape collection

244
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,759
has about 30 species with 1400

245
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,679
accessions and the tart cherry which

246
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,399
again is like it's small but it's one of

247
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,479
my favorite things things ever to talk

248
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,360
about um so here's just kind of our

249
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,000
numbers we mentioned like the quarter of

250
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,519
a million distributed um Geneva mostly

251
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,720
was Distributing Apple for a long time

252
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,639
like reaching about you know 6,000 to

253
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,200
8,000 accessions a year or samples a

254
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,078
year that we were Distributing um postco

255
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,240
we've had some like pullback just

256
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:53,319
because we want to like focus our energy

257
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,480
and to making sure that that germplasm

258
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,278
is targeted for breeding and for for

259
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,639
legitimate

260
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,278
research so here's kind of the class

261
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,958
view of like this is a jean Bank this

262
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,799
anyone recognize the one on the left

263
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:09,039
where is it spart spart yeah so like the

264
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,958
Doomsday Vault right and so we have a

265
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,319
vault like this for our vegetable and

266
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:16,399
Seed collection um hemp I should mention

267
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,959
as well is in a vault like this um and

268
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,320
this is what I mean by we need to

269
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:23,879
balance vulnerability and accessibility

270
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,278
so apples are are easily like the most

271
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,559
the simplest way that people have

272
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,600
propagated and and traded apples over

273
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:31,799
time and preserved them is through Al

274
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,720
propagation so you can keep seeds all

275
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,359
you want but if you want a clonally

276
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,600
maintained line like a pure honey crisp

277
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,000
it's only through uh clonal propagation

278
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,800
that you can do so and so if you want it

279
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,519
accessible for pollen and you want to do

280
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,759
crosses you need a tree a mature tree

281
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,799
living in the field and so in 2020 we

282
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,399
had an outbreak of fire blight that

283
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:55,879
really just devastated each um each

284
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,879
Square here in the grid of our field map

285
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,439
represents an accession and the color

286
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,639
indicates disease severity and purple

287
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,839
being the most severe and it's kind of

288
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,039
there's a lot of purple in there so at a

289
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,440
time that like we were reduced Workforce

290
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,199
because of covid policies we had this

291
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,639
outbreak of fire blight which really was

292
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,600
a challenge for us but hey we got on the

293
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,799
cover of agronomy with one of our

294
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,480
picture so we did an evaluation just

295
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:22,519
let's go through the collection and just

296
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,839
evaluate like let's do a quantitative

297
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,078
score of how infected these trees are

298
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,639
just by counting number of fresh and new

299
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:31,559
growth and then taking account of how

300
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,639
many infected shoots and just giving

301
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,119
kind of the rough percentage of those

302
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,560
and you see quite a bit of of broad

303
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,078
variation you know from zero% which

304
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,559
could be just a lucky Escape or I like

305
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:46,319
this one it's like 64% here and about

306
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,599
0.9% so they're right there we're you

307
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,079
know a high probability of tree you know

308
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,800
see here getting some disease pressure

309
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:56,159
but not showing any signs of resistance

310
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:58,559
and then when we map like our the

311
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,480
results by species you see like a lot of

312
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,119
the domestic ated apples have you know

313
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,120
kind of interesting broad range of no

314
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,600
infection to heavy infection Mal saveri

315
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
is the wild progenitor so it kind of

316
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,639
makes sense for that one as well to have

317
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,719
a similar pattern that was June July you

318
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,720
see a lot of those healthy trees

319
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,278
disappear as disease progresses and we

320
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,879
start to capture more infection but a

321
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,838
lot of the wild species retain their

322
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,120
resistance to the

323
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,800
disease and again the challenge for us

324
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,078
is maintaining these collections is

325
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,039
there are

326
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,838
amazing Horticultural practices a lot of

327
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:36,958
them developed at Cornell to manage

328
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,000
apples but not diverse collections of

329
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,359
apples where everything might Bloom at

330
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,399
the same time or at a different time

331
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,639
which is critical for managing a disease

332
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:49,240
like fire blight or the the response to

333
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,000
a certain pesticide and you might be

334
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,959
sometimes we were doing more damage than

335
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,839
good by putting on certain applications

336
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:59,239
of um copper right for example or proex

337
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,040
apogee doesn't not each accession

338
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,320
doesn't respond to the the effects of

339
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,319
apigy to reduce growth to kind of limit

340
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,560
the disease so it really is a tight a

341
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,278
tight rope walk of Orchard management to

342
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,919
like hold the all these diversity

343
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:15,159
collections keep them all together while

344
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:17,399
managing all these different you know

345
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:19,519
challenges and requirements and so a lot

346
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,440
of pruning and regeneration happened

347
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,240
during that time and I think our total

348
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,560
was close to 3,000 individual trees were

349
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,240
propagated and replanted in Geneva and

350
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,599
we're doing so much better now with a

351
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,240
diverse um Management program chemically

352
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,519
that is but there's still an impact on

353
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,959
on on fruit quality again this is where

354
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,440
we don't rely on uh commercial practices

355
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,759
we can do things that like will

356
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,399
sacrifice fruit quality to main maintain

357
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:49,278
tree Health um but this is one of the

358
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,519
consequences is like we'll see Heavy

359
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,679
rusting heavy splitting which makes the

360
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,198
fruit kind of not useful for

361
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,799
characterization which is a critical

362
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,519
part of our our mission so we have these

363
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:02,399
healthy trees right like or we have a

364
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,039
wonderful diversity collection that no

365
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,159
one's interested in using because they

366
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,759
don't know what we have right and but

367
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:08,879
during this kind of heavy fire blight

368
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,440
time we couldn't do a lot of

369
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,000
characterization to take representative

370
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,160
images or get good fruit quality data

371
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,278
from those um the other kind of safety

372
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,198
net that we utilize heavily is

373
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,198
cryopreservation and Apple's one of the

374
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,879
easiest to cryopreserve it's simple

375
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:28,078
collecting dormant signwood like you

376
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:29,559
would right now for grafting and you can

377
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,399
dehydrate it and put it in liquid

378
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:35,359
nitrogen and almost the recovery is you

379
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,799
know 80 to 90% viability and it's

380
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,000
tremendous um really easy to to manage

381
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,000
and get your diversity collections

382
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,078
backed up this way grape is a lot more

383
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,720
challenging it doesn't direct cryle

384
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,559
there's like a shoot tip and a droplet

385
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,639
vitrification so going into tissue

386
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,638
culture getting droplets freezing those

387
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,440
and then bringing those out right so you

388
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,839
can imagine that the the labor intensive

389
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,040
part is like kind of the bottleneck

390
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,040
there

391
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,639
again clonal propagation this is one of

392
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,278
the the coolest and most ancient tools

393
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,120
that we have right like dating back

394
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:13,919
maybe 10,000 years of people

395
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,919
demonstrating that this um capacity so

396
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,759
this is likely how apples were taken out

397
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,639
of original forests and traded and and

398
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:22,839
brought to your backyard right like no

399
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,839
more foraging now we have cultivars we

400
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,759
like we can put them right where we want

401
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,680
and so um again just kind of a an

402
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,879
example of how we do grafting and

403
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,838
propagation to maintain our Collections

404
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,799
and so these are these are examples from

405
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,319
cryo preservation which you can see

406
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,599
here's the root stock and then here's

407
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:44,078
the the bued the chip buted accession

408
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,560
and then yeah you'll get some growth and

409
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,919
then you can trim back the root stock

410
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:50,359
and have a a brand new accession and

411
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:53,198
what's so cool about this is now you

412
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,240
have a timelessness to the diversity and

413
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,278
so things that were are hundreds of

414
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,278
years old or sometimes thousands of

415
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:02,360
years old they report some grapes back

416
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:04,278
to Roman periods um Roxberry russet is a

417
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,440
cool Apple in our excession because it

418
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:09,759
represents the first true American Apple

419
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,519
um it's this kind of wild triploid thing

420
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,839
that's not that tasty but it's again

421
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,240
it's part of American History Mont Mory

422
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:20,199
dates back to the the pre 17th century

423
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,799
and represents the largest um cultivar

424
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:24,278
grown for tart cherry production in the

425
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:26,399
us and our buddy conquer right like we

426
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:29,480
love this grape and its distinctiveness

427
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,879
but this is an old one as well and so

428
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,240
what's amazing is that you walk into

429
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,318
these Collections and you can see things

430
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,440
that were developed you know with within

431
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:39,519
the last 10 years or like the last

432
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,319
several hundred years in our collection

433
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,078
and they're intermixed with the wild

434
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:45,958
species as well so you kind of get this

435
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:47,758
the snapshot of all the diversity in one

436
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,958
time so now I'll just walk through some

437
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,480
of the exciting like I think they're

438
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:54,318
exciting characterization um efforts

439
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,079
that we're going through right now

440
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:57,919
because again like it's not enough to

441
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,638
just have these things be secure we want

442
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,519
people to use them and one of the

443
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,159
limitations to people having access is

444
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,000
just they don't know what we have or

445
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:08,038
what would be interesting to them so

446
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,798
collecting phenotypic genetic data like

447
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:11,519
getting that information out like maybe

448
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:13,759
it's got an interesting pedigree or

449
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,679
history and that makes it more

450
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,038
accessible um so the tarte Cherry is

451
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,559
kind of a nightmare though genetically

452
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:23,519
so it's a tetrol hybrid of a sweet

453
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,439
cherry and a wild European Cherry but

454
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,119
it's got this really interesting um

455
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,720
anthocyanin profile that it's like so

456
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,918
here's anthocyanin again it's not just

457
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,200
red right like it's it's a different

458
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,400
profile which gives it different

459
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,200
chemical properties and distinguishable

460
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,519
through chromatography kind of

461
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,480
interesting that you can tell a suite

462
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,879
from a tart just by it its chemical

463
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,960
fingerprint um melatonin is reported

464
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,320
high and this is one of my white whales

465
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,759
um for characterization because it's

466
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:53,079
just such a fascinating compound to

467
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,519
study um thank heavens that Tik Tok was

468
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:56,678
saved right like I don't know if you

469
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:57,839
guys were nervous about that but how

470
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,880
else would we have known about the

471
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,000
sleepy girl mocktail from tart cherry

472
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,360
juice right so here's a great use of

473
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,558
social media to promote a crop um go and

474
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,439
look this up again there's there's a lot

475
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:11,279
of

476
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,440
interesting um I don't know anecdotal

477
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,240
things that like we do with with our

478
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,679
crops um but sleepy girl mocktail

479
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,359
highlights kind of the the the Sleepy

480
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,000
benefits of of tart cherry juice which

481
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:24,479
might be related to melatonin or might

482
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,159
be nothing at all but we'll we'll

483
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,880
investigate more what's cool about tarte

484
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:32,480
cherries is that they're kind of having

485
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,480
a moment right now um so I guess I would

486
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,519
say like Grandma drinks prune juice

487
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,360
right and like your ultramarathon Runner

488
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:41,558
is chugging down tart cherry juice and

489
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,798
so like they have like this is one brand

490
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:44,158
like they've got the pit crew who

491
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,400
doesn't want to be part of the pit crew

492
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,919
right that's great that's great branding

493
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,080
and it's like a great promotion of a

494
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,880
product and it gets it into diverse

495
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:55,038
markets and applications and it's not

496
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:59,559
just uh a $3 bottle of cherry juice now

497
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:01,759
it's a $15 bottle of elite you know um

498
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:03,599
endurance juice right like drink this if

499
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,400
you want to to gear up for I don't know

500
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,759
Marvin's seminar or like maybe he's got

501
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,519
a tough exam coming up chug some tart

502
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,158
cherry juice maybe it'll help but the

503
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,200
problem with the tart cherry industry in

504
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,039
the US is it's narrowly it's like

505
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,558
precariously dependent on a single

506
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,240
cultivar um which again we if you take

507
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,279
any agriculture class you know that this

508
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,319
is bad news and you shouldn't do that um

509
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,879
so we wrote a fruit quarterly on like

510
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,879
let's move Beyond Mont morenzi

511
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,039
highlighting some of the the interest

512
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,039
ing diversity within the usdaa

513
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,759
collection and I highlight this again

514
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,279
because you can see the red is our tarte

515
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,240
cherry and it gets very little attention

516
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,240
compared again we're it's maybe a

517
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,480
hundred million dollar um industry in

518
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,798
the US on a good year compared to like

519
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,880
the billions that gra grape and apple

520
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:50,279
bring in so it's it's nothing it's not

521
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,679
the smallest crop but it yeah it could

522
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,839
benefit from some diversity so we've

523
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,798
looked at phenological traits so phen

524
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:58,918
like Bloom time alone sets back the

525
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:02,319
industry um every couple of years years

526
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,960
just by a frost bite or Frost um damage

527
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,839
and ruining your your crop um fruit

528
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,840
chemistry I mentioned like interesting

529
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,279
phenolic profiles that like might be

530
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:13,279
related to some of the nutritional

531
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:14,839
benefits of the the juice and then fruit

532
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,000
just generic fruit descriptores and

533
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:19,759
images um pit weights you know looking

534
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,839
at pit to fruit ratios you can like kind

535
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:25,440
of maximize um fruit size and not waste

536
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:27,959
yeah waste energy and and a market on a

537
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,159
heavy pit this large excessively large

538
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,000
pits

539
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,960
um looking at tart cherry Bloom

540
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,319
phenology we do see some like some

541
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,400
significant variation so this might be

542
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,399
this maybe represents a month-long span

543
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,200
with the the vertical line here

544
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,960
representing Mont Morenci so you can see

545
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,360
there's some extreme light blooming

546
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,480
Beyond Mont Morenci and then actually we

547
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,158
could do a lot worse for New York State

548
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,038
and so where the most of the production

549
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,280
is is in Michigan State which they have

550
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:59,720
maybe an even more volatile Springtime

551
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:02,079
than we do some years um so again here's

552
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,000
an article from 2012 when I started at

553
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,079
Cornell and I wondered where we talk

554
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
about tart cherries where are all the

555
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:09,240
tart cherries well there was a frost

556
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,720
that year that killed um Michigan and

557
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,159
Geneva's tart

558
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,640
cherries um so beyond just like looking

559
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,320
at Bloom phology we can ask um assay

560
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,520
using differential thermal analysis that

561
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,839
um Jason Londo now at Cornell is a

562
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:25,679
specialist in and so we did um a

563
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:28,000
three-year evaluation of 64 tart cherry

564
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,880
accessions looking at its cold hearty

565
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,159
adaptation um acclamation and de

566
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,600
acclamation over time and we're excited

567
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,360
to like um finally summarize these

568
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:38,439
results and get them out but just some

569
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:39,959
initial graphs you can see that each

570
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,320
species and then within the species

571
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,079
there's variation for this trade which

572
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,879
again is going to hopefully help us

573
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,439
Target climate specific cultivars or if

574
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,799
there's a yeah a new region that wants

575
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,120
to expand their cherry production how it

576
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,519
could be

577
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:57,199
done um I I do like this image of tart

578
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,400
cherries because other crops have these

579
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,000
beautiful diversity displays is like

580
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,759
cherries kind of all really do look

581
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,640
pretty similar like there's not a whole

582
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,240
lot of like morphological or size

583
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,360
variation that exists currently so it's

584
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,400
maybe a gap for us to fill um but each

585
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,639
one of these like box plots represents a

586
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,919
different trait you can see total total

587
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:21,278
total soluble solids the sweetness right

588
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:24,080
or its acidity or its acid R acid sugar

589
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:26,038
um ratio and each one like Mont Moren is

590
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:29,038
kind of on the low end so low end for

591
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:30,960
sweetness but not bad for its um it's

592
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,960
sugar acid ratio which is actually more

593
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,519
important than the total content to

594
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,000
begin with it's just our perception of

595
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,519
how sweet or how acidic something is I

596
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,640
think this is what sets back our whole

597
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,879
industry is the weight of Mont Moren is

598
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,038
pretty good and it's like it's on the

599
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,679
late blooming so conversion of an

600
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:49,519
orchard or like adoption of a new

601
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,720
cultivar is going to be kind of hingent

602
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,798
like can we get the same fruit size the

603
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,360
same dependen like I don't know the same

604
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:58,960
quality from a new cultivar even though

605
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:01,519
if you look at the anthym profiles which

606
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,720
again is the new market for tart cherry

607
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,720
juice is like high Den High nutrient

608
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,798
density like it tends to be on the low

609
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,319
end for almost every

610
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:12,000
trait um so here's just an example um

611
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,439
we're kind of chromatography nerds in

612
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,798
our group so again sorry apologize for

613
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,360
the excessive use of chromatograms but

614
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:22,240
here's again the specific tart cherry

615
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,599
anthocyanin and then the Sweet Cherry

616
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,120
anoc in and again here's a sweet cherry

617
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:29,480
it's missing mostly this glucos Altin

618
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:32,158
aide compound and then you do see this

619
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,640
kind of interesting hybrid like ratio

620
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,799
split between the two um but again Mont

621
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,080
Mory kind of on the low end for the

622
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:43,639
content variability Aroma and so I get

623
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,319
really excited about flavor and Aroma uh

624
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,840
diversity within the collection so Ben's

625
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:50,558
alahh is the classic Cherry compound

626
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,959
that we associate with C candy it's also

627
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,399
can fool us to thinking something's

628
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,400
almond as well it's the same chemical

629
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,919
but here's like some Benz alahh results

630
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,038
and you can see Mt morenzi kind of on

631
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,400
the lowend you could really drive that

632
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:05,119
cherry flavor by using different um

633
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,640
diversity or for breeding purposes um

634
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,599
this one was an interesting hybrid

635
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,360
accession with another wild species and

636
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:14,558
it's it has this more common grape um

637
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,759
aromatic linol which kind of is more

638
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,839
Floral in flavor and almost missing Benz

639
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:20,839
alahh so you can kind of see as you

640
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:23,639
start to profile like where you could

641
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:26,079
push flavor in um in a breeding program

642
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,520
or even just using these as um direct to

643
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,639
market for yeah for an heirloom

644
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:34,158
production or for something else but so

645
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,240
LOL content really is exciting to me so

646
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,399
we have seed friends in Geneva that do a

647
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,679
lot of seed analysis so we can use their

648
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:43,079
equipment so here's a Marv um Marvin

649
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,640
seed analyzer you can throw Pits on and

650
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:46,599
a whole fruit because chairs are small

651
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,520
enough and get you know circularity so

652
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:50,918
we're not spending a a tremendous amount

653
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:52,918
of time kind of with calipers and doing

654
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,480
these individual measurements so it's

655
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,520
kind of a nice higher throughput genetic

656
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,519
markers are um invaluable but

657
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,519
challenging to like used for breeding

658
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,480
just because of the tetrol nature but

659
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,720
you can see a clear split between the

660
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,798
sweet cherries in red the tart cherries

661
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,519
in black and the the um progenitor

662
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:13,200
ficosa in greed here and some kind of

663
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,639
like interesting things that yeah are

664
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,558
happening in there I won't go too much

665
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,600
into that um kind of the Highlight

666
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:22,798
though of of my career I think so far

667
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:25,398
has been this discovery of Mount Vernon

668
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,639
the the home of George Washington right

669
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,839
um for the history Buffs in the room

670
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,679
right like this is

671
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:32,759
like one one of our founding fathers the

672
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,679
first president of the United States U

673
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:37,440
they found Cherry preserves during an

674
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,440
excavation of the basement there and

675
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,080
they found you know initially one bottle

676
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,558
we got a phone call because like they

677
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,839
thought they knew it was cherries from

678
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,798
the pit specimens and how do you ignore

679
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,240
that phone call right like we went down

680
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,720
immediately while they were discovering

681
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,399
bottles in the ground this is Tori and I

682
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,480
like there at the Dig the dig site and

683
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:56,119
they were like everyone was screaming

684
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,360
out oh we found a bottle of 27 it was

685
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:00,038
like kind of a thrilling Indiana Jones

686
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:02,479
moment right are we going to unleash

687
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:04,480
some curse or like I don't know some

688
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,360
interesting Horticultural artifact but

689
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,240
so Tori and I actually have the the

690
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:10,000
privilege and honor now to be sifting

691
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,720
through the contents of those bottles

692
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,119
pulling out pit samples which we can

693
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,159
compare to Modern pits and look at like

694
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:18,239
because again the pit seam and the pit

695
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,399
shape all kind of is indicative of a

696
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,919
cultivar here's some stem fragments

697
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:25,519
which like that's amazing preservation

698
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,720
for about 250 year years old here's kind

699
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,918
of like a bottom like or a top down view

700
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,600
of one of the bottles which again it's

701
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,880
like some of the fruit is still intact

702
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:37,439
and exciting um we've isolated DNA from

703
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,600
them to compare to a reference library

704
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,600
and it's yeah super exciting um to to be

705
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:45,519
able to kind of bring to light again one

706
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:47,798
of like this is a a huge American story

707
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,720
that we get to be part of the

708
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:52,639
telling so here is moving on to Grape

709
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,558
and grape is interesting because it's

710
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,840
split between two sites so we have a

711
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,839
tale of two collections one in Davis

712
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,278
California one in Geneva I don't know

713
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:03,599
where you'd rather be today but I don't

714
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:07,679
know California seems pretty nice minus

715
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:10,278
the horrible fires but um so primarily

716
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,919
um Vena or the historic European wine

717
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:15,319
grapes table grapes in California and we

718
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,759
specialize in cold hearty hybrids which

719
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:19,278
again it's like we we call it the cold

720
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,038
hearty grape collection but it's so much

721
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,599
more than that like um disease

722
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,879
resistance and flavor is what um we

723
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:29,839
really should be promoting um so we're

724
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:33,080
doing a a large profiling of about 350

725
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:35,798
vanifer accessions and about a 100 plus

726
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:37,639
um hybrid accessions from Geneva to look

727
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:39,918
at like anthocyan profiles which are

728
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,799
huge for again nutritional content but

729
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,159
now wine and table grape Industries um

730
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:45,960
these are just a few of the like

731
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,440
interesting profiles that come out like

732
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,240
so these are all run with the same

733
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,640
analysis you can see some anthos in Rich

734
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,038
some really anthos in poor accessions in

735
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,159
um in melon versus royalty and the

736
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:59,919
classic Mero right kind of like you know

737
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,919
in Middle Ground there this is Papa

738
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:07,720
Smurf um so this is yeah it's our our

739
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:11,000
Workhorse um lcms in the lab

740
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,399
there um so again when we look at total

741
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,599
um karic acid which is important acid in

742
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:18,678
in wine we see again some extreme with

743
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:21,038
Mero being on the the really low end and

744
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:23,399
some really um interesting cultivars or

745
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,000
accessions on the highend which some

746
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:27,479
studies are showing karic acid

747
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,359
associated with other um physiological

748
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,839
traits like maybe drought tolerance and

749
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,359
some other things which will be kind of

750
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,359
interesting to compare this is with

751
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,038
fruit but how do you what does what do

752
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:40,519
leaves look like as well um again

753
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:43,079
anthocyanins the color of of your wine

754
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,960
is so important not just for like antoin

755
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:47,519
but for the marketing we Low's kind of

756
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,399
again on the middle to low end not of

757
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,880
the box plot but we do have some really

758
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:55,119
extreme high antoin cultivars and and

759
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,600
again these are just some interesting

760
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:01,678
stats from some uh from our diversity

761
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:04,798
evaluation so one one cultiv our royalty

762
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,880
had 30 individual antoin any we talk

763
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,558
about like how do we diversify the human

764
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,240
diet right like so anthos in rich foods

765
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:14,960
but anthos in diverse Foods as well are

766
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,720
play a major role in

767
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,919
that um we do solidphase micro

768
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,640
extraction or spey which um we're using

769
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,320
a method developed by Gavin saxs the

770
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:28,360
famous um wine food scientist here in

771
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:30,319
Cornell itha and it's super yeah super

772
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:32,359
low input platform that gives us a lot

773
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:35,359
of really powerful results so again

774
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:37,278
here's our conquer our foxy Aroma um so

775
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,119
we're able to all these purple compounds

776
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,119
are ones that are heavily associated

777
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,678
with the foxy um Aroma and grape and so

778
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:47,158
we can profile that and Muscat I

779
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:49,519
mentioned the linol so muskat grapes

780
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,278
have just such a distinctive and lovely

781
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,798
Aroma um like a French perfume I don't

782
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:55,079
know how else to describe them but but

783
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:57,440
better but sweeter you don't want to

784
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:59,240
drink French perfume maybe but these

785
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,600
grapes really like have such a

786
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,960
fascinating flavor um mostly from linol

787
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:07,000
and other monot turpins so again I

788
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,798
that's why I'm really excited about our

789
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,240
tart cherry that has more of a a Muscat

790
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:13,278
grape

791
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,679
profile and and here if we're looking at

792
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:18,398
linol diversity this one accession is

793
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,360
really on the high end um July muskat

794
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:25,158
for this narl compound another similar

795
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:27,158
or musat Associated compound um one of

796
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,720
the challenges is like the name so we

797
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,360
have the cold heart grape collection

798
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,399
which is more than cold hearty full of

799
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:35,639
hybrid grapes which could be anything it

800
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,119
could be um domestic to a wild or wild

801
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,840
to Wild inter specific but it's kind of

802
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:42,000
it's just this non-descript term that

803
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,199
really makes it hard to to Leverage The

804
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,759
Power of the collection so here we have

805
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,798
um Stout seedless which is 90% Vena and

806
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,759
Napa which is 10% Vena and grin in our

807
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,798
database they're both called hybrid so

808
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:56,519
pulling out that information really

809
00:30:54,798 --> 00:31:01,200
limits right like if you're searching

810
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:04,000
just by taxonomy alone so um we did

811
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,240
ancestry estimations using PCA principal

812
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,880
component analysis and you can give a

813
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,159
percentage to how much of one particular

814
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,159
ancestor um contributed to one or

815
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,600
another so we have now um kind of a

816
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:20,399
continuous variation of from 0% hybrid

817
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:21,759
to or 0% Vena to 100% benifer in the

818
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,759
collection so at least that like

819
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:28,319
classification helps bring to light some

820
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:29,759
of the cultivars that we can use

821
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,200
um and these are just I always have to

822
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,879
highlight this because um Peter cousins

823
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,919
who was a longtime breeder for the usca

824
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,480
now at Gallow um has developed these

825
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,559
cultivars from hybrid grapes in Geneva

826
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,839
so like high disease resistance really

827
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:48,200
interesting environmental adaptation but

828
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:49,398
also amazing fruit quality as well so it

829
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,919
kind of proof that you can take

830
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:54,398
something hybrid with a wild background

831
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,360
and bring it into a more cultivated and

832
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,759
not just serving New York industry but

833
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:01,359
California Industries as well well um

834
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,440
kind of the heart of the collection this

835
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,319
is what I spent my PhD studying is the

836
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,519
apple collection and working with Susan

837
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:10,798
Brown um the Apple breeder here at

838
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,720
Cornell um but we've got you know

839
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,119
several thousand accessions and we talk

840
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,919
about an apple a day this is almost you

841
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,158
know 15 years of apples a day if you

842
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:21,399
were to try one accession every day so

843
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,039
kind of endless Joy right if you're

844
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:25,278
looking for that Wonka Everlasting

845
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,798
Gobstopper like you can just spend years

846
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,638
searching the collection looking for

847
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,398
that um this is kind of showing our

848
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:32,519
fingerprint of or footprint of

849
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:34,879
distribution like we've really touched a

850
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:37,399
lot of the major Apple production World

851
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,159
um in the world which is kind of cool

852
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:41,918
like so these are accessions that landed

853
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:44,360
somewhere internationally or not and

854
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,440
Apple has an interesting domestication

855
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:48,879
because we talk through grafting this

856
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,159
instant domestication but um Apple

857
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,080
itself is a hybrid between two species

858
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:55,278
and the story has been retold and told

859
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:57,278
so many times every time I want to gloss

860
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,679
over it though someone maybe Marvin in a

861
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:00,759
tour like oh no you got to tell the

862
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,919
story and have to go back and and and

863
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,398
highlight that but so really trading

864
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:06,919
apples out of Kazakhstan through Europe

865
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,518
where at hybridized with a different

866
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:11,200
Apple so we get this interspecific

867
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,120
nature to Apple which makes it

868
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,480
interesting any guesses on which is the

869
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:20,518
domesticated which is the wild

870
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:23,558
row top middle bottom what do you guys

871
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,359
thinkle no middle yeah you're actually

872
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:26,918
right so that's the malice sarii

873
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,079
Representatives that we have in the

874
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,080
collection To Go

875
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:35,038
Hannah and so this story really was was

876
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,840
famous here's jaro fio I love this

877
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,879
picture of him and the the first curator

878
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:41,158
for Apple Phil forsland so they got the

879
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,480
helicopter in to Kazakhstan how cool is

880
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,120
this right like like I'm talking Indiana

881
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,880
Jones level like just going into a

882
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,038
basement and looking at Old bottles and

883
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,360
stuff like they actually got a

884
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:51,960
helicopter in and collect fruit from the

885
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:53,959
wild which is really cool and was

886
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,840
popularized by Michael pollen the

887
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,200
botania of Desire um so this is showing

888
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:00,000
over time the growth the apple

889
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,759
collection you can see starting with a

890
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,880
large donation from Cornell um the

891
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:07,158
breeding program a lot of wild material

892
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,200
and then huge amounts of malice of ACI

893
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,280
the wild progenitor of Apple coming in

894
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,878
in the 90s and over time it kind of has

895
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,519
like slowed down to like being more

896
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:17,598
targeted for wild

897
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:20,000
species um but the story really wasn't

898
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,519
done being told until we had strong

899
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,398
genetic background and genetic data um

900
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:27,719
because what we thought was pure malice

901
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:31,118
to verci so we brought back maybe 383

902
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:33,279
sessions into the collection 151 only

903
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,519
were pure what we considered pure

904
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,760
species pure malice um cersi 215 were

905
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:42,759
admix we have a hybrid um population and

906
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,760
then 17 were pure domestica in the

907
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,399
forest of kha'zix stand and again

908
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,240
explain how that can happen it's kind of

909
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:50,440
amazing right so apples get around and

910
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,719
they're they're welld designed even

911
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,838
through propagation to to propagate

912
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,678
themselves and just be planted where

913
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:59,599
maybe they shouldn't be planted but this

914
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:01,480
is kind of highlighting the the really I

915
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,280
don't know the stress and strain of like

916
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,119
collecting wild Apple today and not

917
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,119
waiting right because if there's an

918
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,800
apple orchard down the road that pollen

919
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,160
is going to add mix into a wild

920
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,880
population and over the course of you

921
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,399
know a few decades who knows what will

922
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,640
be left of that so the genetics are

923
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,000
secure with apple the the purity of a

924
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:24,920
species if that's a a high a primary

925
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
concern is is yeah it's kind of a

926
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,358
nightmare um what's so cool about our

927
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,519
story s i those all of this came out

928
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:34,598
that it was still a mystery of who was

929
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:37,119
the wild progenitor of apple and it was

930
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:39,400
germplasm found by the USDA and brought

931
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,800
here that has been now distributed to

932
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,760
Europe back to Kazakhstan for

933
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,920
repatriation and it was like really that

934
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,480
initial effort to conserve malari that

935
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,519
gave us so much scientific information

936
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,318
so it's kind of yeah it's a it's a huge

937
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:55,960
win for our our our unit and the the

938
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:59,318
legacy of Phil forsland and those um BB

939
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,039
aldwin you have to mention him as well

940
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:02,400
um so again when we look at genetic

941
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,880
diversity though within the collection

942
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,639
we see a lot of clones because a lot of

943
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,200
things have names and the names Chang

944
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:11,239
and so we bring it in not knowing that

945
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,239
it's actually identical sometimes the

946
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:14,639
Clones are like take up space but

947
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:17,479
sometimes they're really useful because

948
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,838
you might have um just single mutation

949
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,838
sports that like maybe it's Golden

950
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:24,318
Delicious with a new novel trait added

951
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:25,880
and that kind of is exciting for

952
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:28,119
breeding because otherwise these These

953
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,960
cultivars are stuck without any kind of

954
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,519
mutation just because they're yeah

955
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,119
they're they're fixed in time through

956
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,119
through colonal

957
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:37,879
propagation of course I have to show

958
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,519
more chromatograms you thought I was

959
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,160
done um but this is licorice flavor

960
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:45,039
estral and so apples most people don't

961
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,358
have this familiarity with apples but if

962
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:49,519
you go to an or Orchard late in the

963
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,719
season and harvest even a a Golden

964
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,318
Delicious you'll get a a bright licorice

965
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:55,959
flavor or maybe it's dark depending on

966
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:58,039
if you hate dark or if you hate licorice

967
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,079
but it's it's it's a fascinating flavor

968
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:02,239
and I think it adds to the diversity and

969
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,400
what what consumers want in that novelty

970
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,118
I think the red flesh apples maybe had

971
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,358
their moment and it's not that exciting

972
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,400
anymore because it didn't really bring a

973
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:13,759
lot of interesting um flavor or

974
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,639
interesting I don't know we love that

975
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,520
element of surprise and just red flesh

976
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:20,960
wears off pretty easily um but flavor I

977
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:23,039
think is kind of an I think a powerful

978
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,079
Target for for modern Apple breeding

979
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:29,358
alha Farine um is kind of associated

980
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,920
with some um some disorders in post

981
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:33,519
Harvest and you can talk to Chris

982
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,720
Watkins about all of those but um honey

983
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,280
crisp is one of the the major I don't

984
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:40,959
know the troublemakers with some post

985
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,880
Harvest disorders like um scald and

986
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,119
Alpha Farine is associated but I don't

987
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,358
know if it's really clearly um

988
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,960
demonstrate how it is but this

989
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:53,078
particular R is really high um it's got

990
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,119
some estral but you know low in this

991
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:56,680
particular

992
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,920
sample I have to leave with some life

993
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:00,519
advice so wherever you go maybe you

994
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,880
don't care maybe you've tuned out Apple

995
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:03,880
grape and tart cherry this whole time

996
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,559
maybe your thing is carrots I don't know

997
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,119
or berries if Mar um but like just

998
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:11,000
whatever trait whatever crop you're

999
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,720
working on just consider the germplasm

1000
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,838
like so many studies that I read from a

1001
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:18,679
curatorial or Gene Bank perspective like

1002
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,358
fall short of what they could be had the

1003
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:22,318
authors more carefully considered what

1004
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:24,559
diversity that they were including in a

1005
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:26,920
study and again you can make huge

1006
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,838
progress and just the scientific

1007
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,960
discoveries like Limitless when you're

1008
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:33,000
like really working with a strong um

1009
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,280
genetic Foundation but please like don't

1010
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,079
forget like the silliness and the joy of

1011
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,079
what we do like there's a reason we're

1012
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,720
not in agriculture and maybe growing

1013
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,119
wheat right like there's a reason we

1014
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:45,358
picked horiculture as opposed to I don't

1015
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,960
know running a combine 247 like there's

1016
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:52,159
a joy in what we can bring in new fruit

1017
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:54,318
flavors and diversity to the world um

1018
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,199
please come see us like the Apple T

1019
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:57,519
apple and grape tour is in the fall

1020
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:59,559
usually associated with the plant

1021
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:02,039
breeding tour if you're um within that

1022
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:04,799
group um and then the tarte Cherry tour

1023
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,480
is maybe mid July we picked a firm date

1024
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,359
and then all the cherries ripened before

1025
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,679
that date and so stay tuned for maybe a

1026
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,519
more updated like tour date for the the

1027
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:16,279
tarte cherries have to acknowledge yeah

1028
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:18,800
wonderful colleagues at Cornell

1029
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:22,560
fantastic team with the USDA and I will

1030
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,560
leave the some time for

1031
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:28,199
questions I have a question yeah so you

1032
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,399
said M Mor has been around like 400

1033
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:33,239
years and so the industry's really

1034
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,920
locked into that R so if you did come up

1035
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:37,799
with something was even better maybe

1036
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,039
they already have would the industry

1037
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,480
adopt it or are they so stuck on moity

1038
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:44,960
that they're just not going to change

1039
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,119
yeah talk to amyone who was

1040
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,159
the yeah so Marvin's question was like

1041
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,760
okay Mont moren's old news there's may

1042
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,719
be something interesting what's the the

1043
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,040
likelihood for an industry to adopt that

1044
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:58,279
and I think Amy aone at Michigan State

1045
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,279
University along time breeder for root

1046
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,720
stocks and advocate for new tarte

1047
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,280
cherries like had some success in in

1048
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,159
getting Balaton and other kind of

1049
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,160
heirloom land race cultivars into

1050
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:12,239
production um but yeah just strong

1051
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,759
resistance and I I don't know again if

1052
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:17,719
if there's just the risk of it's already

1053
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,760
such a small industry and like the the

1054
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:21,879
extra effort to go to a new cultivar is

1055
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,960
just is not worth that to them I think

1056
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,800
it just needs maybe a few more crop

1057
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,159
failures through Frost damage right and

1058
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,920
because that's that that's an easy one

1059
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,239
to overcome with with some of the

1060
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,240
diversity that we have already and just

1061
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:38,000
Bloom late just bloom a week later and

1062
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:39,598
you you've saved yourself an entire loss

1063
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,599
so yeah I I don't know I don't know what

1064
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,920
holds back industry from that

1065
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,800
Chris uh just out of curiosity a little

1066
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,280
while ago we were had an email exchange

1067
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:54,400
about the apples of New York volume one

1068
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,960
volume two uh how many of those apples

1069
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,680
have been saved or has the majority of

1070
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,358
them they lost the history yeah so how

1071
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:05,000
many so Chris is referencing that and

1072
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,400
maybe you shouldn't broadcast this that

1073
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
you have the apples of New York books

1074
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,480
volume one and two which again careful

1075
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,760
there are no break-ins but these are

1076
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:17,639
yeah so these are Hedrick um so in the

1077
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,040
early 1900s published these apples of

1078
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:21,799
New York's book and I don't even know

1079
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:23,719
I've never seen one I've never like look

1080
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,760
through it to see like how many are in

1081
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:27,639
there and how many like would CR

1082
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,000
reference back to the collection but

1083
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:31,358
it's been reported that there are you

1084
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,199
know tens of thousands of Apple

1085
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:36,279
cultivars that have been named that were

1086
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:38,480
at one time in the world right and

1087
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,880
whether those were synonyms pseudonyms

1088
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,679
right like same name but yeah or like

1089
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,358
how many yeah how many of those actually

1090
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:49,440
exist today in the collection is that's

1091
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:51,719
kind of hard to to figure out yeah and

1092
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,358
we don't necessarily want all of them so

1093
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:55,838
right now we're like we had that hit

1094
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:57,880
that acquisition phase and we filled the

1095
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:00,318
the acreage pretty quickly and now it's

1096
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,119
really targeted like we want proof that

1097
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,838
it's something really interesting

1098
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:07,920
genetically or culturally important or a

1099
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:09,599
wild accession that deserves that spot

1100
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,680
otherwise yeah we're happy to work with

1101
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,318
Partners like Seed Savers or other

1102
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,719
Heritage groups to conserve those

1103
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:18,159
because there is a quite an heirloom

1104
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:19,639
hobby Enthusiast group for Apple that's

1105
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:21,598
out there chasing them and you'll read

1106
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:24,039
about it in the news the Lost Apple

1107
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,318
groups

1108
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:29,199
and yeah

1109
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:32,358
like for especially for something like

1110
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:34,879
apple where the center of origin is

1111
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:36,759
overseas like the sort of you can't just

1112
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,880
like for germ plasm you can't like shove

1113
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:42,599
seeds in your pocket not that you should

1114
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:46,119
do that anyways but like you obviously

1115
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:48,480
is it sort of like a like a uh through

1116
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:50,640
University like researchers you exchange

1117
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,280
things do are there similar germ plasm

1118
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:56,000
collections yeah overseas is there like

1119
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,680
a diplomacy thing yeah so there there

1120
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,719
are international treaties that we're a

1121
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,000
part of that like allow for that

1122
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:04,159
exchange through um a shared material

1123
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,199
transfer agreement so everything's again

1124
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:08,318
above board we're not going in and and

1125
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:10,318
taking anything that doesn't belong to

1126
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,079
us right like making sure that countries

1127
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:15,920
that have the germ plasa maintain that

1128
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:17,400
that ownership of it with apple and with

1129
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,280
grape and tart cherry it's it's

1130
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,599
challenging because of viruses to import

1131
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,839
and so we do have like aphis the animal

1132
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:27,640
plant health inspection service like has

1133
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:30,078
a quarantine site that specializes as in

1134
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:31,519
in Palm fruits and stone fruits and so

1135
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,000
it can go through there we actually from

1136
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:36,599
those 90s Explorations there's still a

1137
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,639
malice sersi in quarantine that still

1138
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,359
has viruses that like just will not get

1139
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:44,239
cleaned up right so this is like 30

1140
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,920
years now in quarantine um the pipeline

1141
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,399
now with like genetic tools and like

1142
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,680
screening for viruses can can streamline

1143
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,200
that a little bit so you can get it

1144
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:55,118
quicker but yeah so the pro process for

1145
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:57,318
importation is a

1146
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,559
challenge yeah well I was going to say

1147
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:01,920
when you get a chance to check with Gen

1148
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:01,920
see if

1149
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:08,000
Geneva let's see oh so Ira who's a new

1150
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,519
um postto with the grape genetics

1151
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,838
Research Unit asks about PCA ancestry

1152
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:15,759
for grape and I'm not sure if it works

1153
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,679
for different Ploy I mean I assume that

1154
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,760
it would like we're able to capture that

1155
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:22,000
and intelligibly like I know just

1156
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,000
looking at the principal component

1157
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,280
analysis say that like these results

1158
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,239
match what we know about these

1159
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,400
accessions but maybe there's some flaw

1160
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,759
in doing the quantification well chat

1161
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,480
Ira that's a good

1162
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,440
question I may have interrupted question

1163
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,440
that was felt to be

1164
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:46,079
asked bill can I ask a question

1165
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:48,279
hello yes yeah this very smart uh great

1166
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,960
great talk Ben just a very quick

1167
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,920
question I saw you have a 20K snip chip

1168
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,119
I'm just curious all the genotyping that

1169
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:01,240
you've done on Apple for example was is

1170
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,640
that based on a snip array or what what

1171
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:06,679
are your favorite genotyping

1172
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:09,879
methods yeah so um the snip aray is

1173
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:12,159
phasing out and it was um developed for

1174
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,519
commercial apples or domesticated apples

1175
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,440
so it falls short for us and when you

1176
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:19,239
start looking at hybrids or wild we've

1177
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,440
used a lot so my um experience has been

1178
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:23,959
more with genotyping by sequencing which

1179
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,079
again is a is a every platform is flawed

1180
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,720
but this one at least can account for

1181
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,800
different genomes and it's um it's

1182
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,598
updatable so as new genome references

1183
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,800
come out or you have a new wild

1184
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:36,240
accession that you don't know where it

1185
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:39,280
fits that's been really helpful in kind

1186
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,919
of elucidating relationships um

1187
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,280
collaborators now are just going for

1188
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,440
full genome sequencing and so that'll

1189
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,480
probably be the future but I think um

1190
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,159
disentangling the pedigrees of Apple the

1191
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,440
snip array and just its reliability for

1192
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:58,000
the domesticated has been really helpful

1193
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,000
for that that data set

1194
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,559
I'm supposing what you distribute from

1195
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,519
the center varies right in some cases it

1196
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:07,040
might be seeds in other cases it could

1197
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,719
be

1198
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:11,558
wood yeah so um what do we distribute

1199
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:13,358
it's primarily Canan wood because people

1200
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:16,839
want to propagate an accession but

1201
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:19,639
pollen as well or fruit samples for um

1202
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:21,679
yeah different studies seeds not so much

1203
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:23,838
unless they're for wild just because

1204
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:26,000
yeah people want to to maintain that

1205
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:28,719
genetic Integrity of their accession

1206
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,159
seeds are nice because well in theory we

1207
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,279
can trade them more easily because of

1208
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:34,639
virus issues but I know some recent

1209
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,200
research at Cornell agretech has kind of

1210
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:39,639
made us questioned that whether it's

1211
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:39,639
truly virus free through

1212
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:43,719
seed anything

1213
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:57,119
else this has been a production of

1214
00:46:54,199 --> 00:47:00,118
Cornell University on the web at

1215
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,119
