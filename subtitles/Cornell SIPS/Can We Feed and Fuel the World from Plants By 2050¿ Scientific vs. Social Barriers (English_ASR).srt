1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,990
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:04,990
University

3
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:17,420
so what I'd like to talk to you about is

4
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:20,269
what I see is two very major issues

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,700
where I think the u.s. in particular can

6
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:25,550
play a major part that through

7
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:28,579
innovations I hope I can convince you

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,829
that at least scientifically we can play

9
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:34,670
a major part in feeding the world and

10
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:38,239
fueling the world from plants by 2050

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:44,090
but there are a number of social

12
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:45,739
barriers acceptability issues which you

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,320
know we're also going to have to

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,859
overcome and may the the larger

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,259
challenge but most of my talk will be on

16
00:00:50,859 --> 00:01:04,459
the science and why I think these goals

17
00:00:54,259 --> 00:01:06,319
are our possibilities so just um like

18
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:10,069
parts of Cornell Illinois is a

19
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:12,199
land-grant University this is our

20
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:14,929
Institute for genomic biology and I put

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,609
this picture in because in front of it

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,950
those maize plants are growing on the

23
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:21,549
morrow plots which is the oldest

24
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,520
agricultural experiment outside of

25
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:29,359
rothamsted England so mazes being grown

26
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:31,298
there since 1876 so if you like it's one

27
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,489
of the longest sustainability

28
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:36,200
experiments and existence so samples

29
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:39,469
have been taken every year so we can

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:44,270
look at changes in soil properties and

31
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:46,340
sustainability and this was Professor

32
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:52,039
morrow when he was setting these plots

33
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:54,890
up I'm almost 150 years ago we're so

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,760
proud of the fact that like you we have

35
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:04,090
alumni who World Food Prize laureates

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:06,770
married L Clinton and Rob Fraley who I

37
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,679
think importantly we rewarded the World

38
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:13,158
Food Prize for their work on bio

39
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:17,109
engineering of crops which is perhaps

40
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:20,358
quite a change in the wards and maybe

41
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:21,150
telling us about the role of new

42
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:25,379
technology

43
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,980
in moving through production forward so

44
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:30,688
what I want to look at they're really

45
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:34,438
three issues addressing food security

46
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:35,848
under global change and as upset at the

47
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:39,150
beginning i'll be talking a lot more

48
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:42,119
tomorrow about global global change and

49
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,908
that things that and also the issue of

50
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,489
whether we can have bio energy without

51
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:50,009
conflict with food production and then

52
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:53,299
I'll finish briefly talking about some

53
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:59,068
of the barriers as I see them to moving

54
00:02:53,299 --> 00:03:02,700
these opportunities forward so dressing

55
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:06,298
food security on the global change if we

56
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:08,789
look at apologize this is data for 2013

57
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:13,230
but that's the most complete global data

58
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:15,949
we have our present if we look at the

59
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:21,209
most important crops in terms of

60
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:25,798
productivity of food primary foodstuffs

61
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:30,049
then today amazes number one over a

62
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:32,310
thousand million tons produced in 2013

63
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:34,829
four people stood up at the back there

64
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,400
are lots of seats here please please

65
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:40,109
come and sit down because it standing up

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,449
is a good way to keep awake during my

67
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:47,760
talks but it's uncomfortable on your

68
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:52,829
feet so so so please feel free to come

69
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:56,668
and sit now so so maze over a thousand

70
00:03:52,829 --> 00:04:01,199
million tonnes rice next very closely

71
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:03,120
followed by wheat and then soy somewhat

72
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,120
distant fourth but of course soy is an

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,239
extremely important source of dietary

74
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,919
protein both in animal feeds and in

75
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:16,319
because our food for us the United

76
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,049
States plays a big part in the

77
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,120
production of these crops although we

78
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:24,709
only have a tenth of the world area

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,860
devoted to maize in fact we produce over

80
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:31,528
one-third of the world's maze we produce

81
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,960
about a third of the world's soy and the

82
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:36,829
significant part of the

83
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:39,288
world's wheat as well and the United

84
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:42,079
States remains the biggest exporter of

85
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:43,879
these primary foodstuffs so what happens

86
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:47,448
in the United States is actually very

87
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:55,129
important for costs of many of these

88
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:56,449
foods globally so why with all that

89
00:04:55,129 --> 00:05:00,139
production why should we be concerned

90
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:02,478
well the United Nations Food and

91
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:05,509
Agricultural organization report looking

92
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,598
forward said well by 2050 we're going to

93
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:11,720
have a third more people on the planet

94
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:14,149
but they are going to be far more urban

95
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,840
than they are today so we're seeing

96
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:21,829
rapid urbanization diets and urban areas

97
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:24,319
are historically different they use more

98
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:26,149
processed food more animal products

99
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,800
because people have a higher income and

100
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:30,679
so when you put those two things

101
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,098
together more people and different diets

102
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,220
they estimated that we need seventy

103
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:40,459
percent more primary foodstuffs by 2050

104
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:44,449
than we have today thirty percent more

105
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:48,589
by 2030 and because there isn't that

106
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:51,169
much more land than could support these

107
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:54,348
primary foodstuffs that would have to be

108
00:05:51,168 --> 00:06:02,240
achieved by making more per hectare of

109
00:05:54,348 --> 00:06:04,579
land so are we able to meet this

110
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,060
requirement well if we look at what has

111
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:12,050
happened historically so this figure

112
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,449
goes back to nineteen sixty we can see

113
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,978
what appears to be a fairly steady rise

114
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:21,468
in the yields of wheat and rice this is

115
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:24,620
average global yields of these crops per

116
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:26,120
hectare of land so we can see that for

117
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:32,860
both of these crops it's more than

118
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:36,288
doubled over that nearly 60-year period

119
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:40,848
so if we project that forward would say

120
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:44,240
well by 2050 will increase this much but

121
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:47,930
if we actually look at how much we need

122
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,930
of these crops then we need to be

123
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:56,259
following this trajectory and clearly

124
00:06:50,930 --> 00:07:00,860
we're we're not at the present time and

125
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:02,930
indeed this is beginning to go forward

126
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,538
into the costs of these primary

127
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:13,038
foodstuffs so for example if we look at

128
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:17,658
wheat prices back in 2006 about 130

129
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:19,969
dollars per ton by the end of 2013 there

130
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:22,430
were three sixty dollars now I know

131
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:27,409
everything has come down in price since

132
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:30,199
that time including gasoline but this is

133
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:32,598
at the beginning of March it was still

134
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,509
three hundred and twelve dollars per ton

135
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:39,259
and this is considered to be a low in

136
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:41,259
prices fao estimate that we're probably

137
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:45,379
going to see a doubling of food prices

138
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:49,729
primary food prices on a seven-year

139
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:51,560
cycle given present trends now we don't

140
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:54,019
really feel that impact very much

141
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,718
because these primary foodstuffs are

142
00:07:54,019 --> 00:08:00,918
really a very small part of the cost of

143
00:07:56,718 --> 00:08:04,209
what our household budgets but in cause

144
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:07,779
some parts of the world household budget

145
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:10,939
sixty seventy percent of it goes on

146
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:13,939
basic foodstuffs so if they double in

147
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:17,629
price that is a catastrophe for those

148
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:19,759
those areas the other side of this

149
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:23,478
problem is that we aren't really

150
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,270
improving yields year-on-year the way we

151
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:29,959
were if we look at the percentage

152
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:31,879
increase over previous decades China

153
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,848
India and Indonesia are the biggest

154
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:37,009
producers of rice in the world if we

155
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:40,820
look at their improvement in your per

156
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:42,828
hectare then in the 70s and 80s when

157
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,910
dwarf cultivars were coming in from the

158
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:49,338
Green Revolution yields are improving

159
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:53,000
forty percent per decade if we go

160
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:55,510
forward now to the last decade we're now

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,669
into single-figure improvement

162
00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:01,059
this is despite the fact that countries

163
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:04,740
like China are spending a hundred times

164
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:08,679
what they were in the 80s on rice

165
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:11,169
improvements so more and more effort is

166
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:15,429
needed and yet we're not getting the

167
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:17,740
same return that we were and indeed

168
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:19,449
there's a fear that rather than going on

169
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,600
a linear trajectory that we're actually

170
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:25,270
getting into a stage where we're seeing

171
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,970
a flattening out of yield improvement

172
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:31,000
year by year and of course part of this

173
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,920
may be impacted global change part of it

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,279
maybe they were just reaching biological

175
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:40,059
limits on some aspects of crop

176
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:42,579
improvement and this is a another study

177
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:45,099
which was looking at wheat yields

178
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,259
through the world where some areas are

179
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,409
showing improvement but many the yellow

180
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:54,250
are showing stagnation and red is where

181
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:57,370
yields have actually collapsed so in

182
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,009
fact we over the last decade the average

183
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:05,019
yield of wheat per hectare of land has

184
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:07,149
not improved at all so why might this be

185
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:08,679
why did we do so well in the Green

186
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:13,480
Revolution and now we're struggling

187
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:15,459
today well um I'll only put up one

188
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,639
equation and this is a simple equation

189
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,160
but I want to use it to explain why this

190
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:24,519
may be and this is looking at your

191
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:28,179
potential so I if we haven't if we have

192
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:30,309
a given variety of a crop what is the

193
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:33,939
maximum yield it can achieve at a site

194
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:35,769
if there are no pests and diseases we're

195
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,240
giving it the nutrients and water it

196
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:41,590
needs so why might yield potential

197
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,440
improvements in your potential be

198
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:48,040
stagnating well if we look at what

199
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,570
determines your potential first of all

200
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,000
is the amount of sunlight that's

201
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:56,170
available during the growing season of

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,509
that crop secondly it's how good is that

203
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:04,199
crop up capturing that sunlight thirdly

204
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:07,480
how good is it at converting that

205
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,930
captured sunlight into biomass

206
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,329
and how good is it then partitioning

207
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:16,328
that biomass into the parts of the crop

208
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:22,028
we really care about so the grain of

209
00:11:16,328 --> 00:11:24,009
rice the seed of soybean and so on now

210
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:26,980
these are some numbers for a modern

211
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:30,009
soybean cultivar growing on a university

212
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,990
farm where we measured radiation

213
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:36,939
interception we followed the growth of

214
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:39,610
the crop and so we find is that actually

215
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,820
the interception efficiency this is

216
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:48,000
visible radiation because photosynthesis

217
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:50,920
only uses visible radiation was 89% and

218
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,929
sixty percent of the biomass ended up in

219
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:57,729
the seeds so if you think about sort of

220
00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:00,638
putting a seed in the ground it's got to

221
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,860
cover the ground really these figures

222
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,389
are pretty remarkable already and it's

223
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,560
hard to see we can make them any better

224
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:11,139
if our crop is going to have any more if

225
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,239
it's going to have some seed pods it's

226
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:15,759
going to have some stems to hold the

227
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,720
seed then getting much better than sixty

228
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:21,789
percent seems unlikely and this in

229
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,459
particular is what we really changed in

230
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:28,149
the Green Revolution many pre Green

231
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:29,768
Revolution rice and wheat cultivars had

232
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:32,679
a partitioning efficiency of about

233
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:34,929
thirty percent or harvest index of

234
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:38,049
thirty percent today they're around

235
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:42,939
sixty percent interception efficiency

236
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:47,189
has been improved as well so these are

237
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:49,959
perhaps theoretical maxima for

238
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,000
interception and partitioning this is

239
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,809
what we achieve but if we look at

240
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,698
conversion efficiency which is largely

241
00:12:54,809 --> 00:13:02,409
photosynthesis then that falls far short

242
00:12:57,698 --> 00:13:07,019
of the maximum and this is something

243
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:11,588
that we appear not to have improved in

244
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:16,539
breeding for improved your potential in

245
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:19,390
crops so do we know that if we did

246
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:20,689
improve photosynthesis we get any more

247
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:24,799
yield

248
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:27,720
what is the evidence we have for that

249
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:32,208
well this was something I was able to

250
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:35,910
set up when I first moved to Illinois in

251
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:38,729
1999 we called it a face system and

252
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:40,799
basically what these rings do and this

253
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:47,240
was really to investigate global change

254
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:50,278
is that this green you can see here now

255
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,639
this I call it a ring but it's really an

256
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:56,730
octagon these pipes release carbon

257
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:59,129
dioxide according to wind speed and wind

258
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:03,539
direction so if the wind is coming from

259
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:05,939
this direction then co2 is released so

260
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:07,349
that it is blown across the ring and of

261
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,320
course the higher the wind speed the

262
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:13,500
more co2 we release it took about a year

263
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,200
of engineering to get this right but now

264
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,100
we can elevate co2 to what we think will

265
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,350
be the level in 2050 we put the

266
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,540
apparatus in as soon as we've sown the

267
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,028
crop and we keep it in place until the

268
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:29,849
crops dried down then we remove the

269
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:34,049
apparatus so we can bring in small plot

270
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:36,480
combines so we achieve within plus or

271
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:38,759
minus ten percent of our target for

272
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,269
pretty well ninety percent of the time

273
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:46,490
so the engineers managed to get it right

274
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:50,039
so within here you've got elevated co2

275
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:53,990
now carbon dioxide is a limiting

276
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:56,578
substrate for photosynthesis so

277
00:14:53,990 --> 00:15:00,629
photosynthesis come dioxide plus light

278
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:03,299
plus water gives you carbohydrate co2 is

279
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:06,149
limiting so if you give it more co2 you

280
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:09,838
get more photosynthesis does this give

281
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:12,690
us more yield it gives us 25 percent

282
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,520
more photosynthesis and it gives us

283
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,670
about sixteen percent more yield in

284
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,819
soybean about twelve percent more in

285
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:23,719
rice fifteen percent more more in wheat

286
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:27,170
so we know that if we can boost

287
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:30,720
photosynthesis we can get more yield and

288
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:33,240
if we put this back into our equation we

289
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,170
can see conversion efficiency has gone

290
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,419
up

291
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:39,120
this isn't measuring photosynthesis is

292
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:42,028
measuring the amount of biomass we get a

293
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,509
unit of light capture by the plant and

294
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:47,820
this ends up in significantly more more

295
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:51,419
yield we've been doing this since the

296
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:56,730
year 2000 and we routinely see these

297
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:58,919
yield increases now what I don't want to

298
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,920
give you the impression is that well

299
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:05,549
rising co2 is good because that's going

300
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:08,669
to give us more yield rising co2 causes

301
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:11,490
a lot of other problems including rising

302
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:13,500
temperature order precipitation patterns

303
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:17,039
all of which are going to impact our

304
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,990
crops and we found many things that

305
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,360
wouldn't have been predicted without

306
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:25,110
doing these experiments one of the

307
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,720
expectations was that as co2 Rises pest

308
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,419
damage the crops would go down because

309
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:34,560
there's more carbon and less nitrogen in

310
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:37,110
theory so insect pests have to work

311
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:41,489
harder to get the nitrogen they need for

312
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:44,850
their proteins and this is one of the

313
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:49,500
biggest pests of maize in the Midwest

314
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:52,560
the Western corn rootworm what it what

315
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,470
it does is in the fall it will come into

316
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:58,198
the soybean it will feed a little bit on

317
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:01,850
the soybean and lay its eggs ready for

318
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:05,250
the next crop because it's in a soybean

319
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:08,849
maize rotation which this past has

320
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:11,338
adapted to and so it'll lay its eggs in

321
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:14,240
soybean and so the thinking was well

322
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:17,068
this would be less of a pest and indeed

323
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,009
ipcc actually put that into its report

324
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:22,019
it's in several publications but

325
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:24,240
apparently these insects are illiterate

326
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:26,849
and so they didn't know what they were

327
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:31,859
supposed to do and what we found was

328
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:34,639
actually in elevated co2 they laid twice

329
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:38,099
the number of eggs and if you combined

330
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:42,690
rising ozone with rising co2 the

331
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:45,329
situation was even worse and then my

332
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,659
colleague or colleagues avin dilution

333
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:48,939
may Berenbaum looked at

334
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:52,599
some other paths and indeed they found

335
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:55,149
that Japanese beetle damage double the

336
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:57,460
insects live longer they produce more

337
00:17:55,148 --> 00:18:01,209
young and the same was true with the

338
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:05,829
soybean aphid as well so there are many

339
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,569
unexpected impacts of rising co2 but

340
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:10,509
what he did show is well if we can boost

341
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:14,408
photosynthesis we can get more yield so

342
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:16,808
can we do that breeders really don't

343
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:19,269
seem to have managed to select from all

344
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:21,989
photosynthesis there's a good reason for

345
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:25,089
that there's very little variation in

346
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:27,940
photosynthesis in the germ plasm so can

347
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:30,988
we intervene can we perhaps through

348
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:36,369
engineering get more photosynthesis and

349
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:39,249
this is I'd say very timely because it

350
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:41,499
appears to be the only remaining way we

351
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:43,710
can get more yield potential we can

352
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:46,389
obviously improve disease resistance

353
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,669
agronomy and so on but in terms of

354
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:51,308
genetic yield potential it looks like

355
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:54,909
the only one of those three things we

356
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:57,519
have left to improve we know the process

357
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:59,619
in a great deal of detail is probably

358
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:03,220
the most studied of all plant processes

359
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:06,249
we know every step of the pathway every

360
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,919
gene involved every protein involved how

361
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:11,379
they're assembled and so on we also have

362
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,899
high performance computing which can

363
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:17,648
allow us to simulate the whole process

364
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:21,069
in silico and crop transformation is

365
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:28,868
becoming increasingly routine even in

366
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:31,058
the public domain so I just want to give

367
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:34,589
you sort of an example of that in in

368
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:37,690
practice one of the things that my

369
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:41,048
former student and now collaborators

370
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:44,919
young man jus conducted when he was

371
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:47,200
doing his PhD was to take or all of the

372
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:50,109
hundred steps of the photosynthetic

373
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,139
process and then described them as a

374
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:56,769
series of link differential equations

375
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:58,689
and of course after two and a half years

376
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:59,120
of work we were eventually able to get

377
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,789
this

378
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:05,269
to start delivering something that in

379
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:10,308
silico look photosynthetically like the

380
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:12,170
response of a leaf so the next thing can

381
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:15,430
then do once you have that is you can

382
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,870
then say well okay we're now simulating

383
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:20,360
imagine this is like a car production

384
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:22,899
line with many different steps you can

385
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:26,240
now simulate the whole thing in silico

386
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:29,240
and you can say okay I have a hundred

387
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,039
workers on my production line where

388
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,890
should I be investing those hundred

389
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,230
workers so what you can then do is apply

390
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:39,950
an evolutionary algorithm which

391
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:42,049
basically takes one step at random takes

392
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,330
away a worker or ads on a worker and

393
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:47,509
sees whether it makes any difference to

394
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:50,509
the system because 99 times out of 100

395
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:52,390
you just making it worse but every so

396
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:55,519
often you get one which makes it better

397
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,970
you keep that one and then you go

398
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:02,929
through the whole process all over again

399
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:04,789
and I guess what I do like to say about

400
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:07,309
this is we always say it's not rocket

401
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:10,159
science but in this case we could say it

402
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:13,160
was rocket science because what we're

403
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,380
trying to do is numerically integrate a

404
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,710
system of over a hundred link

405
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:21,320
differential equations and this is what

406
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,720
it's called a stiff system because some

407
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:27,139
things are changing very rapidly others

408
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,420
are changing very slowly and this person

409
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:32,630
here Eric distiller was a mathematician

410
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:36,170
who was working on the dynamics of

411
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:39,850
balancing NASA rockets and apparently

412
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:42,529
that is a stiff system and he'd found

413
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:45,139
algorithms for dealing with these stiff

414
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:48,230
systems and so we work together with

415
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:51,290
Eric to actually solve this problem in

416
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:54,579
simulating the photosynthetic system and

417
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:58,308
we use his algorithm to the present day

418
00:21:54,579 --> 00:22:02,389
so anyway this is just a part of what

419
00:21:58,308 --> 00:22:05,990
the in silico simulation was telling us

420
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:09,560
so these are looking at enzymes involved

421
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:11,440
in carbon metabolism so when the plant

422
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,349
has taken up carbon die

423
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,558
oxide the processing of it and the

424
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:19,959
regeneration of the carbon dioxide

425
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:24,250
acceptor and what really stuck out this

426
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:27,879
is a logarithmic base here was that it

427
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:32,138
said this enzyme we should have ten

428
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:33,788
times more than we we have and if you

429
00:22:32,138 --> 00:22:37,359
come to the talk tomorrow i can tell you

430
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:39,579
why we think that is but let them raise

431
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:44,128
the question is well if you elevate this

432
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:46,720
do you really see more photosynthesis so

433
00:22:44,128 --> 00:22:51,250
should say this is where it sits in

434
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,740
metabolism here is the point rubisco the

435
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,319
enzyme most abundant protein on the

436
00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:00,870
planet it's the one that fixes carbon

437
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:05,619
dioxide implant leaves and then that is

438
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:08,408
reduced the carbohydrate and then it's

439
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:11,138
an auto catalytic cycle so it's adding

440
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:13,750
carbon all the time so carbon is coming

441
00:23:11,138 --> 00:23:16,479
in some is draining off for sucrose and

442
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:21,778
starch and the rest has to be recycled

443
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:26,220
and s BPA's sits in this recycling phase

444
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:29,319
so it's a key enzyme we we know from

445
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:32,110
reducing the enzyme that it can slow

446
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:35,259
down photosynthesis so if you increase

447
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:37,500
it can it give you more and this is from

448
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:40,899
my colleague in England Christine rains

449
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,740
they put this into tobacco and here are

450
00:23:40,898 --> 00:23:48,599
her three different events with elevated

451
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:53,048
s BPA's enzyme and here is her

452
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:54,849
untransformed material so Christine

453
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:57,009
showed that in the greenhouse in England

454
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:59,709
and then we collaborated with Christine

455
00:23:57,009 --> 00:24:03,099
to put it back in the field in Illinois

456
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:05,950
we also tested in our face system as

457
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:08,378
well and and indeed in the field we were

458
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:14,139
able to get more biomass produced by

459
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:15,878
just as one manipulation so with really

460
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:18,369
as Bob mentioned we've been looking

461
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:20,099
theoretically many other ways in which

462
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:21,559
you might be able to boost

463
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:24,379
photosynthesis and

464
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:27,829
then a couple of years ago we were lucky

465
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:31,130
that the Gates Foundation been reading

466
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:34,609
what we've been writing and sort of said

467
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:37,580
in a roundabout way well how about we

468
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:40,039
put our money where your mouth is and

469
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:44,599
you show us whether you can really do

470
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:47,509
this and so we were using tobacco as our

471
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:50,179
testbed because we've got ideas coming

472
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:52,569
from many different places so we put

473
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:56,480
those constructs into one cultivar of

474
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:59,359
tobacco regenerate those and then put

475
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,150
them out into replicated field trials to

476
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:05,389
really find out which manipulation might

477
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:08,180
give us more yield and I just show you

478
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:11,320
one of these that been working on this

479
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:14,600
is joint with Chris and I oggis group

480
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:19,490
university of california berkeley where

481
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:22,939
we showed in theory that if during the

482
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:25,640
day the upper leaves of a crop get more

483
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:28,279
Sun than they can use so they have to

484
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,820
dissipate that absorbed sunlight

485
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:34,940
otherwise it will actually become toxic

486
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:38,019
to the leaf if they can't dissipate that

487
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:43,910
sunlight energy they start to bleach and

488
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:48,440
so what Chris what the leaf does is it

489
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:51,440
then brings in quenchers so molecules

490
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,320
which can basically convert that absorb

491
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,950
light energy into heat so it harmlessly

492
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:00,109
loses I've energy as heat but but if the

493
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:03,769
leaf goes into the shade for example for

494
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:08,179
cloud and now light is limiting its

495
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:11,029
still dissipating that energy is heat so

496
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:13,759
and it takes about 30 minutes to an hour

497
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:16,250
for it to recover and regain its

498
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:19,339
efficiency so we shown from a modeling

499
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,349
perspective that this could this could

500
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:25,609
lower productivity by about thirty

501
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:27,949
percent and Krishna yogi sort of read

502
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:32,750
our paper and said well I think I've got

503
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:35,649
a way to speed up this so he sent us his

504
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:38,538
constructs we put them into tobacco

505
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:40,368
and we we checked that they did

506
00:26:38,538 --> 00:26:42,348
physiologically what we thought they

507
00:26:40,368 --> 00:26:46,579
should and this shows that they're

508
00:26:42,348 --> 00:26:49,729
recovering so this shows that they

509
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:54,259
respond far more rapidly than the

510
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:57,139
wild-type and we could also pick those

511
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:59,989
out with fluorescence imaging which is

512
00:26:57,138 --> 00:27:02,778
another way we can look at this but then

513
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:05,479
most importantly when we put them in the

514
00:27:02,778 --> 00:27:07,878
field this is really what they the

515
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:10,669
wild-type look like and these are his

516
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:13,478
plants and of course i should say though

517
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:16,879
all of these plants if you boost

518
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:19,369
photosynthesis initially you see a

519
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:21,439
response which is much better than the

520
00:27:19,368 --> 00:27:25,579
final yield because during the

521
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,519
exponential phase of growth you it's

522
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:31,308
like compound interest okay if you get

523
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:33,409
one percent more that's compounded than

524
00:27:31,308 --> 00:27:36,589
the plants growing faster when the

525
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:39,409
canopy closes that compound interest no

526
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:42,648
longer applies but nevertheless these

527
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:45,649
plants were the biomass was about twenty

528
00:27:42,648 --> 00:27:48,048
five percent greater so we're quite

529
00:27:45,648 --> 00:27:51,918
excited by that we've got others coming

530
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:56,329
through this year so now I want to move

531
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,399
on to bioenergy why I think so basically

532
00:27:56,329 --> 00:28:00,978
in that segment I think that they're

533
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:04,219
armed biotechnological ways that we

534
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:08,269
could have a second Green Revolution but

535
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:10,009
it is biotechnology bioenergy has

536
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,348
attracted a lot of interest and of

537
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:15,249
course now what we're hearing is well

538
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:18,048
hey we're producing as much oil as we're

539
00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:21,798
we're consuming you know the US doesn't

540
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:24,229
have a problem but I know I have two

541
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:27,679
grandchildren and I wonder what is it

542
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:30,499
going to be like when they you know when

543
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,769
they want to do have a lifestyle like

544
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:37,278
that we have is all really going to be

545
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:40,128
as cheap as it is today are we as I

546
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:42,798
believe going to find this is really

547
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:45,319
devastating for our environment and we

548
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,879
do have to wean ourselves off of fossil

549
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:49,759
fuels if there

550
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,390
things hit then we really do need a bio

551
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:57,230
energy strategy and to be realistic to

552
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:59,600
produce significant amounts of biofuels

553
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:02,269
from plants it's not going to be there

554
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:06,709
tomorrow if we want something in 20

555
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:08,109
years we need to be starting today so we

556
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:11,210
shouldn't be looking at the situation

557
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:15,169
today we should be looking at the future

558
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:17,630
I I personally feel and this is a paper

559
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:20,450
that Chris Somerville and I published in

560
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:25,940
science while ago that really Brazil has

561
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:27,650
been a model of doing this they've like

562
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,440
the rest of the world sugarcane in

563
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:33,050
Brazil was in decline because the world

564
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,420
decided it now have plenty of artificial

565
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:39,109
sweeteners there was less demand for

566
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:41,810
sugar we were using corn for making high

567
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:45,049
fructose corn syrup probably not a good

568
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:48,109
thing but it was competing wish with

569
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:51,200
sugar from sugar cane so Brazil's she

570
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:53,899
became was in decline as was the USA's

571
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,569
as was the Caribbean and then they had a

572
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:59,180
crisis where they couldn't afford

573
00:29:55,569 --> 00:30:01,579
gasoline they decided to make ethanol

574
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:04,820
from sugar cane and they really haven't

575
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:08,389
looked back since they did that in 2012

576
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:11,960
was the first year in which a more

577
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:15,560
gallons of ethanol was sold on four

578
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:18,590
quarts and Brazil than than gasoline and

579
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:21,980
indeed they've also been exporting in

580
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:25,039
some years as well so they managed to do

581
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:28,099
this by really reoccupying abandoned

582
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:32,119
sugar cane land and then also moving now

583
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:34,699
on to some fairly low grade pasture and

584
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:37,669
managing to restore that agronomically

585
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:41,809
so it really isn't competing with their

586
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:45,560
food production in any significant way

587
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:48,349
and if you look Brazilian government is

588
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:51,470
now mapped out where you could grow

589
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:53,859
sugarcane so so they've really ruled out

590
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:58,490
areas that require deforestation

591
00:30:53,859 --> 00:31:00,019
competition with food crops and the the

592
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,720
Amazon region the pants

593
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:06,470
region and so on most of this land is

594
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,930
really around San Paulo state where of

595
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:12,890
course they have the biggest demand for

596
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:14,990
liquid fuels but if you take that 16

597
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:17,690
nearly sixty four million hectares and

598
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:20,599
you look at how much ethanol could be

599
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:24,230
produced that would be about fifteen

600
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:26,899
percent of all global liquid fuel use so

601
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:31,430
we'll make Brazil if you like the Saudi

602
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:33,740
Arabia a second Saudi Arabia but with

603
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:37,759
the advantage that they have a

604
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:44,480
sustainable I'm renewable and apparently

605
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:49,220
indefinite if you like oil well and of

606
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,950
course we in the 48 lower states at

607
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:54,829
least we can grow relatively little

608
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:57,140
sugar cane although i'd say we're under

609
00:31:54,829 --> 00:32:00,230
utilizing the areas where we can grow it

610
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:02,390
and because hawaii which was a bit

611
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:05,240
cheeky aim producer has a lot of

612
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:08,450
abandoned land as less porto rico that

613
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,579
could be used but of course what has

614
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:14,420
come onto the scene now is samuel osich

615
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:16,399
ethanol where we could make ethanol by

616
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:19,100
digesting down cellulose and

617
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,190
hemicellulose to release the sugars and

618
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:24,109
ferment those to ethanol and indeed

619
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:27,830
we're seeing the first commercial plants

620
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:31,069
poet has its first commercial plant in

621
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:35,809
iowa which is using corn stover to

622
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:38,569
digest the cellulose down to glucose and

623
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:41,470
the Hemi cellulose down to pentoses and

624
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:45,009
is now using that for ethanol production

625
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:47,960
but if we think beyond our food crops

626
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:51,589
what this opens up is the opportunity to

627
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,590
use almost any plant material so it

628
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:57,679
gives us an idea to reimagine

629
00:32:53,589 --> 00:33:01,250
agriculture and this is a wish list of

630
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:04,340
what our ideal crop would look like it

631
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:06,380
will be a c4 plan because c4 plants are

632
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:08,689
more productive it would have a long

633
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,330
growing season it will recycle its

634
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,850
nutrients we don't need nutrients to

635
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:16,730
make ethanol you know

636
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:19,189
feedstock so it's completely different

637
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:22,130
to a food crop and be productive on

638
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:28,870
marginal non arable land where it won't

639
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:31,610
compete with with food crops and so I

640
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:34,639
just once showing a wire field crops are

641
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:36,889
really not well suited to this task now

642
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,160
we're very proud of the productivity we

643
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:42,230
get out of our maize plants in Illinois

644
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,808
but if we look at their use of this is

645
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,150
the course of solar radiation this is

646
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:51,048
how much the corn crop gets so all of

647
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:53,298
this is wasted we also grow winter wheat

648
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:57,139
does a good job of capturing this

649
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:59,629
early-season radiation but then mrs. all

650
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,270
of this perennials really do have

651
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:05,150
generally do a better job because this

652
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:08,239
is a poplar and of course willows are

653
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:11,480
similar they already have reserves so

654
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,849
that when temperatures become warm

655
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,889
enough they can expand their leaves very

656
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:21,519
quickly and do a much better job of

657
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:24,309
capturing radiation and this is a grass

658
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:28,280
Miscanthus giganteus which really fits

659
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:30,409
these specs very well and I should say

660
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,429
there's something I've worked on for 30

661
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:37,070
years most of it in in Europe where

662
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,470
actually that table I showed you is not

663
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:42,289
new it's something we came up with in

664
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:44,898
the first energy crisis over 30 years

665
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:48,469
ago when we were asked by the european

666
00:34:44,898 --> 00:34:51,138
commission to look at this issue so this

667
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:55,339
is when I moved to Illinois this student

668
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:58,550
or now a professor in Iowa State Emily

669
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:01,550
Heaton and was in my classes and said

670
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:05,990
well I want to try this plant in in

671
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:07,940
Illinois so we we grow it this one but

672
00:35:05,989 --> 00:35:11,108
this is the most we've seen but this

673
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:15,019
particular crop was 60 dry tonnes per

674
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:18,079
hectare so one of the biggest yields of

675
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:20,539
anything in in the Midwest in one year

676
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,119
and I said I'd grown it in England

677
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:26,929
previously and this is this is in

678
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,210
kilograms per meter squared x 10

679
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:32,269
to get tons per hectare that's a

680
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:36,130
harvested yield of 20 tons per hectare

681
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:41,420
which is pretty well a record for

682
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:44,150
Britain but one of the big advantages of

683
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:46,460
these perennial grasses if you just want

684
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,588
the biomass is that they move their

685
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:52,130
nutrients into the shoots as they grow

686
00:35:48,588 --> 00:35:54,369
in the spring in the autumn or fall they

687
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:57,680
move those nutrients back into the

688
00:35:54,369 --> 00:36:00,400
perinatal organs in the soil so if you

689
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:03,649
harvest them late fall or early winter

690
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:07,460
you're leaving the nutrients behind and

691
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:10,160
in fact rothamsted in England now this

692
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:12,559
has been grown for 15 years we now added

693
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,858
nitrogen and if they do have nitrogen

694
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:20,599
they don't see a yield in increase so

695
00:36:15,858 --> 00:36:22,519
very sustainable crops and this is these

696
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:25,970
are our trials in Illinois where we're

697
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:28,338
harvesting them late winter we compared

698
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:31,669
it with switchgrass which has been a

699
00:36:28,338 --> 00:36:33,588
favor bioenergy crop but generally the

700
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,619
yields we've tamed with switchgrass were

701
00:36:33,588 --> 00:36:38,900
quite a bit lower than with with the

702
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:41,740
miscanthus although that's not to say

703
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:44,630
that switchgrass doesn't have a role

704
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:48,588
this is just showing biomass

705
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:52,099
accumulation over the growing season for

706
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:54,739
miscanthus and for switchgrass the

707
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:56,588
important thing is that miscanthus is

708
00:36:54,739 --> 00:37:00,078
putting a lot of biomass into the soil

709
00:36:56,588 --> 00:37:02,750
so we've now got farmers interesting

710
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:08,750
than this for restoring their soil

711
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:10,429
carbon now of course wall champaign

712
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,739
county gets some of the highest maize

713
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:15,409
yields in the world so one of my

714
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:18,469
graduate students Frank Dolman and now

715
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:21,199
works for Monsanto was curious about Liz

716
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:23,868
miscanthus really better than maize and

717
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:27,769
he found it was indeed and the reason

718
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:30,170
was again if you look at solar radiation

719
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:32,449
over the growing season this is what a

720
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:35,539
modern maize cultivars capturing and

721
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:38,539
this is what miscanthus is capturing and

722
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:39,139
that's because miscanthus produces

723
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:41,659
function

724
00:37:39,139 --> 00:37:44,599
leaves earlier and can maintain them

725
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:49,759
later and so it captures about sixty

726
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:53,719
percent more sunlight and then if we

727
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:57,140
look at the amount of biomass plotted

728
00:37:53,719 --> 00:38:00,169
against interceptive radiation that

729
00:37:57,139 --> 00:38:02,679
tells us the efficiency with these with

730
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:05,659
which these crops convert the

731
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:09,199
intercepted sunlight into biomass and

732
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:11,539
you can see that this is maize this is

733
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:14,329
miscanthus these lines are almost

734
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:16,789
identical so the difference is really

735
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:19,940
the maze can sorry miscanthus can just

736
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:25,820
do it for more of the year it can do it

737
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:28,610
in colder weather than maize can now it

738
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:31,250
isn't just you can get a good yield in

739
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:33,980
central Illinois these are some of the

740
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:36,469
European trials we had this is on the

741
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,000
west coast of Ireland this is on land

742
00:38:36,469 --> 00:38:41,149
which historically we know has never

743
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,599
been plowed never been used apparently

744
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:48,349
for food crop Sonja that's 72 horsepower

745
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:52,099
tractor and there is au miscanthus crop

746
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:55,789
so it can grow on marginal soils very

747
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:58,670
successfully Fernando me guess who's now

748
00:38:55,789 --> 00:39:01,579
also a professor at Iowa State was a

749
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:04,579
postdoc with me developed a mechanistic

750
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:06,769
model a very detailed model to really

751
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:09,889
predict where we might get good yields

752
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:13,340
in the u.s. ring fed yields and you can

753
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:16,869
see that it isn't just on these fertile

754
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:21,850
soils of the Midwest but also through

755
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:27,219
into much poorer soils in Georgia

756
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:30,319
Tennessee Alabama and so on indeed

757
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:32,750
tomboy a colleague of mine tom boy and a

758
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,320
grandmas now has trials there which

759
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:39,050
seemed to suggest that that is correct

760
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:42,170
so what could you do with this in terms

761
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:46,820
of bioenergy in the United States how

762
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:49,490
much lamb would you need well this is

763
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:53,240
these brown areas of the areas that we

764
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:56,449
now use for our primary if you like

765
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:59,389
made a row crops so most of it of course

766
00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:01,579
is in the Midwest Mississippi Valley and

767
00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:04,909
then right out here in the central

768
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:08,420
valley as well a lot of this land if you

769
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:10,609
had looked drawn this map a hundred

770
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:14,030
years ago a lot of this land would have

771
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:16,010
also been in row crops including parts

772
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:18,830
of western New York State which are not

773
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:21,070
not today so have a lot of lamb which

774
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:26,119
has dropped out of productivity

775
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:29,030
production that could be used so if if

776
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:32,059
you take this square as the amount of

777
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:36,950
the united states that we use for row

778
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:40,340
crops today 176 million hectares out of

779
00:40:36,949 --> 00:40:46,460
almost a thousand million in the 48

780
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:49,340
states so about seventeen percent is in

781
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:54,650
row crop production how much will we

782
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:57,619
need to reach this goal which was to

783
00:40:54,650 --> 00:41:01,570
produce about a third of liquid fuel

784
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:04,450
production the liquid fuels we need

785
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:08,440
produce about a third of them by 2030

786
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:12,199
for crop like miscanthus you would need

787
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,929
9.7 million hectares we have 11 million

788
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:17,960
in CRP and of course it doesn't just

789
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:20,809
have to be miscanthus you could also

790
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:24,829
think of crops like agave which can grow

791
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:28,029
on semi-arid land as well you need more

792
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:30,949
hectares but we have a lot of semi-arid

793
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:34,640
land which is really in quite poor

794
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:37,549
condition a lot of it degraded by early

795
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:40,730
settlement where you could even restore

796
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:42,980
soil carbon so it really wouldn't be a

797
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:45,949
large burden on the amount of land we

798
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:48,199
would need to do this and then we also

799
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:53,889
have the situation we're producing about

800
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:57,819
110 million tons of pole which is

801
00:41:53,889 --> 00:42:01,420
declining in its need because we're

802
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:05,330
moving more and more to media like this

803
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:06,119
demand for Pope is is declining although

804
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:11,639
apparently some

805
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:14,130
users are still not going away so we

806
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:17,848
have those opportunities don't have

807
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:20,338
finish on biofuels by saying that there

808
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:24,210
are opportunities beyond cellulosic

809
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:26,489
ethanol as well and our pre which is a

810
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:28,650
branch of the Department of Energy put

811
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:31,639
out a call for some high-risk proposals

812
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:35,249
so together with Brookhaven National Lab

813
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:37,318
university of nebraska and of university

814
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:41,818
of florida we put together a proposal

815
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:44,068
where we said well sugar cane and sweet

816
00:42:41,818 --> 00:42:46,679
sagar among the most productive plants

817
00:42:44,068 --> 00:42:49,829
we have supposing we could get them to

818
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:53,730
accumulate oil in the stem instead of

819
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:56,039
sugar because you would get far more oil

820
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:59,880
per hectare then you could get from

821
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:02,910
canola or soybean and so we set about

822
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,309
trying to do this and it was a test of

823
00:43:02,909 --> 00:43:07,889
concept but in two years we've managed

824
00:43:05,309 --> 00:43:11,298
to get accumulation of oil in the stem

825
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:14,429
of about five percent we've identified

826
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:19,068
late stem promoters to attach the

827
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:21,838
constructs to and we've also engineered

828
00:43:19,068 --> 00:43:26,038
photosynthesis in these plants to get

829
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:28,679
more productivity and we on a separate

830
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:32,160
line has been hybridizing shooting came

831
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:36,389
with miscanthus their close relatives to

832
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:40,259
try and um breeding improve cold

833
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:42,348
tolerance but these the engineering ones

834
00:43:40,259 --> 00:43:45,748
have moved quite quickly this obviously

835
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:48,838
requires a lot of backcrosses before you

836
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:53,488
can really get back your original cane

837
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:57,538
and so so realize this is too small to

838
00:43:53,489 --> 00:44:00,059
see but this is how much biodiesel you

839
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:03,329
could get per unit of land area this is

840
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:06,210
what we get today from soybean this is

841
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:08,940
what you can get from the came we have

842
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:11,369
now with five percent oil this is what

843
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:14,039
you get if we reach the theoretical

844
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:16,528
target I all the sugar ends up in oil

845
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:18,940
which will be about twenty percent of

846
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:22,420
the biomass in oil

847
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:25,329
and on this matter what you're seeing is

848
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:28,900
yellow is lamb which has been abandoned

849
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:32,318
from agriculture but could be used for

850
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:35,500
growing sugarcane so if we were to grow

851
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:39,699
an oil cane like this on that land it's

852
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:42,579
about 23 million acres about 10 million

853
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:48,269
hectares that would be about sixty nine

854
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:52,150
percent of that 2030 goal so I'd really

855
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:54,699
say that it is possible for the United

856
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:59,280
States to produce a very significant

857
00:44:54,699 --> 00:45:04,169
amount of biofuel renewable by 2030

858
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:07,930
definitely by 2050 if we wanted to do it

859
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:11,619
now of course a lot of what I've been

860
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:14,469
telling you is transgenic technology so

861
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:17,588
you know what is inhibiting us really

862
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:19,750
from adapting this one is doubt that we

863
00:45:17,588 --> 00:45:25,960
really need to worry about food

864
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:29,949
production because Malthus was a vicar

865
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:32,980
in Britain over 200 years ago who showed

866
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:37,000
mathematically populations rising

867
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:39,670
exponentially you is rising linearly a

868
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,909
point will come when starvation happens

869
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:45,659
he forecast that point about 200 years

870
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:49,149
ago and we've managed to avoid him

871
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:51,789
pretty well and we did reach a point

872
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:54,730
before the Green Revolution where it did

873
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:56,650
look iffy but that was overcome and he's

874
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:00,010
been overcome because we've had a series

875
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:03,849
of agricultural innovations of which the

876
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:06,849
Green Revolution was won the we forget

877
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:09,690
that going back 150 years ago the Haber

878
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:13,539
process which is where basically

879
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:15,519
originally coal was burnt to get

880
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:19,719
temperatures where you could convert am

881
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:22,659
spirit nitrogen into ammonia the source

882
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:25,389
of most of our nitrogen fertilizers

883
00:46:22,659 --> 00:46:27,868
today probably allowing about four

884
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:30,429
billion more individuals on the planet

885
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:31,930
but I put it to you if the Hebrew

886
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:36,369
process was invented to

887
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:39,489
a would society be willing to accept

888
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:43,859
this dirty technology despite the huge

889
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:46,989
impact its had on food production and

890
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,940
then of course today we have the

891
00:46:46,989 --> 00:46:51,839
availability of information and

892
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:56,289
disinformation which makes communication

893
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:59,079
of science critical and I think GMO is a

894
00:46:56,289 --> 00:47:01,949
really a classic case where there's been

895
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:05,949
a complete failure in communication

896
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:07,989
because anyone with a reasonable

897
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:11,859
knowledge of plant genetics will realize

898
00:47:07,989 --> 00:47:15,969
that taking one gene and putting it into

899
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:18,700
a known location in the genome is a much

900
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:20,919
safer technology than what we were doing

901
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:24,129
before which was if you like for example

902
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,039
taking a wild relative to get to get a

903
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:30,070
gene for disease resistance productivity

904
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:32,980
whatever crossing that into our crop

905
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:35,470
then backcrossing several times we get

906
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:38,170
our known gene in but we also end up

907
00:47:35,469 --> 00:47:40,659
with many other genes whose function we

908
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:43,450
haven't often no idea about they could

909
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:46,480
be allergens they could even be

910
00:47:43,449 --> 00:47:49,839
carcinogens but that's weak last letters

911
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:54,130
natural and acceptable yet the far more

912
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:56,800
precise technology is really am not

913
00:47:54,130 --> 00:48:01,269
gaining much acceptability at least in

914
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:04,480
many areas of the world and yet at the

915
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:07,030
same time pretty well all of all of

916
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,670
today's insulin comes from genetically

917
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:13,030
modified organisms and somehow that's

918
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:16,300
been accepted and then I think it isn't

919
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:18,730
just our failure to communicate to the

920
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:24,789
electorate at large but the politicians

921
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:27,699
we've for example Florida became worried

922
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:30,190
about new bioenergy crops potentially

923
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:32,589
becoming invasive so it passed the law

924
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:35,200
saying that if you if you're going to

925
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:36,940
trial when these bioenergy crops you

926
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:40,119
have to take out a bond of several

927
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,440
million dollars in case it escapes but

928
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:43,569
there's a clause in the legislation

929
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,650
which says but if you're using the plant

930
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:48,910
for agriculture

931
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:51,130
you're exempt so to a biologist it makes

932
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:52,538
no sense if a plant is going to be

933
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:55,630
invasive it's going to be invasive

934
00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:57,839
whatever your purpose and then we have

935
00:48:55,630 --> 00:49:04,240
the California low carbon fuel standard

936
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:07,000
which will not accept ethanol from made

937
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:10,118
from maize but will accept ethanol made

938
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,230
from sugarcane so we had a year when

939
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:16,318
Brazil ran short of ethanol it imported

940
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:19,539
ethanol from the United States and

941
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,420
California imported ethanol back from

942
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:25,270
Brazil because that was considered

943
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:27,159
sustainable so apparently some molecules

944
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:31,088
of ethanol are different to other

945
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:34,179
molecules of ethanol so but we are

946
00:49:31,088 --> 00:49:37,088
seeing things changing some of the

947
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:42,669
opponents of GM crops have changed their

948
00:49:37,088 --> 00:49:44,889
position quite an hour proponents so

949
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:48,338
what I put to you is from a scientific

950
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:52,019
perspective we could have it all in 2050

951
00:49:48,338 --> 00:49:54,788
weather policy and society will allow us

952
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:59,409
you will the perfect be the enemy of the

953
00:49:54,789 --> 00:50:00,910
good in this situation we don't know and

954
00:49:59,409 --> 00:50:03,868
if you want to know more about these

955
00:50:00,909 --> 00:50:07,420
projects and there are two websites

956
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:11,200
right illinois.edu and petros

957
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:14,048
illinois.edu and these are some of the

958
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:16,960
many people who've worked in my lab and

959
00:50:14,048 --> 00:50:20,670
and made it possible for give that

960
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,670
presentation so thank

961
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,349
you

962
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:39,750
this has been a production of Cornell
