1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:15,678
University uh the topic of my talk today

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,920
is USDA Apple grape and tar Cherry germ

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,000
pling collection um I'm only going to

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,199
give you kind of overview of what we do

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,879
at Geneva so if you have any specific

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,800
question uh about any on my talk or you

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,558
have any question about the collection

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,439
please uh contact me

10
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,359
later first very briefly about some of

11
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,959
history for the national PL ger plasm

12
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,280
system uh President Lincoln established

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,960
us Bureau of Agriculture current day

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,439
USDA and also signed two months later

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,000
signed the morale Lang gr col act in

16
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:56,280
1862 uh and then in

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,039
1898 uh the section of uh CM plan

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,518
introduction was established uh and and

19
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,760
the first Pi which was uh

20
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:08,959
cabbage uh from Russia was introduced by

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,840
neilis Hansen also at the same year in

22
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,759
1898 uh also in 1898 uh the federal plan

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,079
introduction Garden which is the first

24
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,200
one uh which is a current day uh

25
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:23,438
subtropical Horticultural station uh was

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,600
established uh in Miami Florida in July

27
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,839
the same

28
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:31,039
year and uh later in 1904 uh another uh

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,799
plane transction was established at

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,920
Chico California in Northern California

31
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,600
later in

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,680
1919 uh two other one one in Savannah

33
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,519
Georgia and one in Glen uh Maryland was

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,360
established uh in

35
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:50,519
1946 uh the research and Marketing

36
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,438
Act uh allowed to establishment of four

37
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,560
additional Regional plan introduction

38
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:58,478
station that including the northeastern

39
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,519
project we call the ne9 at Geneva New

40
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,438
York in jly July

41
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:07,039
1948 which is become currently the

42
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:09,079
vegetable crop repository in

43
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,360
Geneva uh here just showing you a

44
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,840
diagram this diagram is a little bit old

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,480
but basically uh give you some idea of

46
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,280
uh the center of orange or uh Center of

47
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:23,119
fruit for a lot of uh fruit we consume

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,199
Uh current day uh except some of the

49
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,400
small fruit uh is native to North

50
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,359
American North America otherwise

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,840
majority of the food that we consume

52
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,160
actually come

53
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,878
from other part of the world for example

54
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,560
Apple uh is actually should be more

55
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:44,959
Central origin in this area uh is from

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,239
Central Asia and that's why we need to

57
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,080
uh conduct exchanges also exploration

58
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,719
trying to collect a lot of ger plasm

59
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,120
from other part of the

60
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,800
world uh here are some of the pioneer

61
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,039
that involve with the plan roduction uh

62
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,879
the first two person on the top is David

63
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:04,878
fch child and Walter swingo they are the

64
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,199
two gentlemen in their 20 actually

65
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,598
established the section of plan

66
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,479
introduction in

67
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:14,518
1898 uh neilas Hensen is the first plan

68
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:17,560
Explorer uh he introduced the first Pi

69
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,840
back into the US and uh famous Frank

70
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Meer uh spent a lot of year in China

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,039
doing a lot of exploration uh was and

72
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,158
popy uh he is actually avocado playing

73
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,039
Explorer uh spent a lot of time in the

74
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,479
Highland of Mexico and guadala and later

75
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,798
in Central America and Caribbean

76
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,798
interesting part is he also aspired for

77
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,000
the National Security agent during the

78
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:44,000
World War

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,438
II uh later in the 60 Professor omo uh

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,719
viticulture department at UC Davis

81
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:51,000
collect a lot of variety from from the

82
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:54,560
Mediterranean region of course Dr

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,039
Charlie rcks uh Mr tomato uh spent a lot

84
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,519
of time and the and is collecting all

85
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,919
the wild um tomato ger plasm a lot of

86
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,200
those material actually also have a copy

87
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,839
uh at Geneva current

88
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,000
day uh here's just a diagram showing

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,640
some of the

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,039
location uh for a lot of ger plasant

91
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,399
stations throughout the United States um

92
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,680
you can see we basically have a lot of

93
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,918
different location uh unfortunately we

94
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,040
used to have a location in Palmer Alaska

95
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,039
and that station due to the budget issue

96
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,919
was closed down 3 years

97
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,240
ago uh some of history about how the

98
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,959
Geneva Colonial repository came about uh

99
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,519
basically in 1974 there was a American

100
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:41,319
society Horticultural science workshop

101
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:44,918
on the topic of conserving fruit and not

102
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:48,360
crop was held in Gulf Ontario Canada in

103
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:50,680
1974 and later books and the Barton uh

104
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,360
based on that meeting uh they describe a

105
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,600
plan for colal repository that they

106
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,000
argue that really have a different needs

107
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,320
uh than those than the common sea

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
repository uh therefore from that

109
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,680
discussion and planning uh in 1983 Bill

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,478
surmac who is a supervisor for fun

111
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,240
operation was hired and came on board

112
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:15,680
and uh a year later in 1984 Phil Forin

113
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,960
who was the first curator was also came

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,800
on

115
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,519
board uh for the Apple the malice and

116
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,120
also Coral hotti grape the vitus uh

117
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:28,478
propagation actually started in 1983 and

118
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,360
the first planting was uh was in

119
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,478
1986 the tar Cherry collection was

120
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,960
originally actually housed at the Davis

121
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,918
repository in California but it was

122
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:41,318
moved to Geneva in 1995 for better

123
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:44,120
growing

124
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,280
environment uh in the USDA uh our

125
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,319
Research Unit actually uh divided into

126
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,559
different unit uh we have two units at

127
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,840
the Geneva uh first one is the plan

128
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,478
Genetic Resource unit uh under that we

129
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,079
have uh three different uh project plan

130
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,399
the first one is a sea crop all the

131
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:04,000
vegetable crop uh second one is the

132
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:06,959
coral crop apple cart grape and tar

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,598
Cherry the third is actually Apple Roa

134
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,198
breeding program uh leading by Genero

135
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:14,319
fossil uh then the other Research Unit

136
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,280
is the grave genetic research unit the

137
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,520
ggu uh they working on Grape genetics

138
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,519
and also genomic of

139
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:24,959
grape uh here just showing you some of

140
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,478
the picture of the colonal collection uh

141
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,318
throughout the year uh this is a view

142
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:32,719
from uh 1985

143
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,479
uh we basically uh it's about 2 mile

144
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,960
from the Geneva campus uh this part of

145
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:42,240
the marcari farm we are occupy McCarthy

146
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:44,758
South and this is about 50 acre uh you

147
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,319
can see that picture taken in 1985 there

148
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,759
start some Nursery operation over there

149
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,319
uh

150
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,879
20 22 year later uh this you can see at

151
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,199
the same location but uh just from

152
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,439
opposite direction uh the picture was

153
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,280
taken uh we basically have a lot of

154
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,478
grape and tarch area all the way in the

155
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:08,000
back and also a lot of

156
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,878
Apple uh the slide below just showing a

157
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,918
lot of different picture diversity of

158
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,520
material for the malow we have in your

159
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,399
collection and also some of the vitus

160
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:19,399
and tarer they just have a gorgeous

161
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,399
color during the Four

162
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,079
Season uh the mission of the colonal

163
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,359
repository basically throughout the

164
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,758
entire system basically a four basic

165
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,598
Mission that's a similar mission for all

166
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,879
the repositor first is trying to acquire

167
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,319
second is trying to preserve and the

168
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,919
third is trying to characterize and the

169
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,759
fourth is trying to distribute all the

170
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,878
ger plasm we have but each repository is

171
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,560
a little bit different uh for our

172
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,080
acquisition uh we basically we trying to

173
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,598
get materials through exchanges and also

174
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:54,198
exploration uh basic on the worldwide

175
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:57,000
basis uh for our preservation purpose uh

176
00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:00,280
we have a field collection of trees and

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
also we have a coold storage of a seed

178
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:06,679
most of wild wild g g plasant seeds also

179
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,439
we have we use acquir preservation of

180
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,000
dor and bwood at the USDA National

181
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:15,240
Center for genetic resources

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,439
preservation unit uh for colum Colorado

183
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,280
uh from here on we'll call them the four

184
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,639
column and also for characterization we

185
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,598
use a morphological method or genetic

186
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,000
method trying to study all the assession

187
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:30,000
we have and all the information uh from

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,719
our uh study

189
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,559
uh basically a store at the ger plasant

190
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,599
resource Information Network database we

191
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,038
call that

192
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,959
grin a new version of the grin should

193
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,360
become come on board uh this year

194
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,199
sometime it's called grin Global

195
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,800
supposed to have a better function uh

196
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,160
but it's quite a learning curve trying

197
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:53,519
to change into the new system uh for our

198
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:55,759
distribution purpose uh that's the major

199
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,200
difference between the clonal repository

200
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:01,958
versus the C repository uh basically our

201
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,200
main distribution material at the dorant

202
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,958
bwood but we also distribute summer

203
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,440
bwood but for research purpose we also

204
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,159
distribute pollen fruit uh flour fruit

205
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,760
sea leaf and also a lot of DNA sample in

206
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:17,159
recent year basically free to all the

207
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,838
stakeholder and researcher both in the

208
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,958
United States and also worldwide also

209
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,399
another very important uh function of

210
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:27,039
the distribution is trying to in

211
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,799
increase the public awareness of the

212
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,120
value of the genetic resources we

213
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,120
Preserve

214
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,720
from the ear early on uh the basically

215
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,079
the establishment of the collection uh

216
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,399
because the location at Geneva so for

217
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:46,159
the Mal collection basically we just

218
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:49,278
knock on a door uh of Dr Roger way that

219
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,360
was the Apple sign breeder at that time

220
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,799
uh we got all the donation from all the

221
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,759
Geneva uh Apple breeding program uh

222
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:57,919
basically been going on for over 100

223
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,799
year at that time I got a lot of

224
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,759
material from Dr Roger way at the same

225
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,359
time but we also get a lot of material

226
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,200
from other breeding program in the

227
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,839
United States such as the P program that

228
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,120
stand for the Apple breeding program uh

229
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,760
among the three campus Purdue University

230
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,600
rockers and also University of Illinois

231
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,519
we also get a lot of material from other

232
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,240
campus and also from agricultureal

233
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,600
Canada we also get material from England

234
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,200
National Collection at the long Ashton

235
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,600
research station and also material from

236
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,640
several different other countries uh for

237
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,000
the vitus collection BAS basically we

238
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,919
started by donation from the also from

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,360
the Cornell great breeding program at

240
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,599
that time was Dr Bush R who is still in

241
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,919
charge of the program we also get some

242
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,200
additional material from UC Davis

243
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:45,799
University of Minnesota South Dakota and

244
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,800
several other

245
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,039
places uh today I'm only have time to

246
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:53,319
talk about more about uh the malos wild

247
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:56,278
ger plasm

248
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:59,399
material uh here is a diagram kind of

249
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:02,320
map showing uh worldwide where the Mal

250
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,919
of species distribute uh as you can see

251
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,959
there are four different species in

252
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,958
North

253
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:11,879
America uh there's two species in Europe

254
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:15,078
the sylvas malastas also malos fortina

255
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,879
there are two wild malos material in

256
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:21,159
Central Asia the males oralis and also

257
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:23,360
sasi and as you can see in Asia

258
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:26,480
basically most in China also some in

259
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,039
Japan and other places they just have uh

260
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,320
more than probably close to 40 to 50

261
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:34,120
different species and the hybrid species

262
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,040
over there uh basically in general

263
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,039
that's a

264
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,159
consens consensus that malas actually

265
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:43,838
originate from Central and southwestern

266
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:46,439
China and then throughout history

267
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,399
especially especially through the srow

268
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,160
material actually able to reach Central

269
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,639
Asia eventually went to

270
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,639
Europe and the how the material came to

271
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,639
North America actually was believed in

272
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,000
ancient time during the during the Ice

273
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,440
Age actually there's ancient land bridge

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,200
between the North America and Asia so

275
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,639
the material actually came the other the

276
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,120
the other direction came to North

277
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,639
America and the common modern Apple uh

278
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,360
we consume is a Mal domesticat it's a

279
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:22,959
deploy species with the SAT chromosome

280
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,560
34 um it it is strongly believed that

281
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,319
the origin of modern Apple actually came

282
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,239
from mother

283
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,199
Mali uh there's also some parentage

284
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,759
involved with maybe orientalis uh maybe

285
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:38,039
some sylvestris uh the question still

286
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,039
being

287
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,239
debated the next phase of the malice

288
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,560
collection uh at Geneva was I consider

289
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,480
was expansion phase of the collection uh

290
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,838
especially through a lot of exploration

291
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,720
activity from the from the late 80 into

292
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,560
the 90s uh the first expiration was

293
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,320
Professor Weeden of conal University he

294
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:03,958
went to uh the West Coast uh of North

295
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,959
America to collect a lot of Mal of fuska

296
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:09,599
in

297
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:12,958
1987 uh later the uh graduate student uh

298
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,480
Elizabeth Dickinson uh for her C's work

299
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,078
uh he she collect a lot of material in

300
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,120
eastern US also in the

301
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:23,679
midwest uh three different species angap

302
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,879
Foria coronaria

303
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:30,919
Andes uh from 1989 on Professor herb

304
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:33,639
alko once again together with uh

305
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:36,120
Elizabeth Dickinson and also with

306
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,440
curator Phil Force sline they went to

307
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,639
Central Asia four different country to

308
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,720
cide

309
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:46,560
Mali uh four different time uh then in

310
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,040
1997 uh Professor Alo to get a field

311
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,599
Force line they went to collect seven

312
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,039
different Malo species in China uh in

313
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,040
the southwest China The suan

314
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:59,799
Province uh later uh in 2001 Gabel from

315
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,519
Germany went to the same place to

316
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:04,879
collect similar material uh there were

317
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,839
extensive exchange material between the

318
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,439
two

319
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,639
exploration uh in 1998 uh Field Force

320
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,560
line together with

321
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,000
uh uh Professor Amy arizoni from

322
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:19,958
Michigan State University they went to

323
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,480
Russia to collect a lot of material

324
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:25,919
including malas orales also some other

325
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,199
materials such as tar cherry and some

326
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,159
other Cherry

327
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:33,599
material uh in 1999 Professor aleno

328
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:37,838
together with Fi forine they went to

329
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:42,120
Turkey to collect malas oralis later um

330
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,480
in two uh in 2001 and later um Joseph

331
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,799
Postman from Koval uh repository went to

332
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,759
Armenia and Georgia collect a lot of

333
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:52,198
different species including malos orent

334
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,199
Talos

335
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,639
again uh the malesia exploration in

336
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,839
Central Asia has a very long history

337
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,039
a lot of Russian scientists they studed

338
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,120
the wild Mal G plasm material in that

339
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:10,519
region as early as uh I can find out was

340
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,639
1796 all the way into the

341
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:17,639
1900s uh the famous PL geneticist uh

342
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:19,560
Nicholas ivanho vov of Russia he first

343
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,320
explored the wild Apple forest in

344
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:27,319
Central Asia basically in

345
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:31,560
1929 and in 19 also 1929 uh West over uh

346
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:36,240
who was a planning for was sent by USDA

347
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:38,599
to uh Alma at alata uh Kazakhstan uh

348
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,600
translation means the father of the

349
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Apple uh also in 1929 met up with uh

350
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,680
Balo and explored the material over

351
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:53,720
there and uh in the 1990s uh Professor

352
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:56,198
Dango uh of kazakstan Academy of Science

353
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,079
with uh his colleague they explore all

354
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:02,318
the wild models G plasm material in in

355
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:03,559
aazan uh from the 1950 all the way into

356
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:07,039
early

357
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:09,159
2000 there was a extensive review uh was

358
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,838
written in

359
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:16,278
2003 here's a picture from 1929 uh this

360
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:21,399
is West over who came from USDA uh this

361
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:24,759
is uh vov and they met up in in Elma uh

362
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,919
basically uh in kazakstan looking around

363
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:31,720
the Mal sesia material in that region

364
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,799
and then BAS basically 60 years later uh

365
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,199
another group of USDA scientists from

366
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:38,519
Geneva went there to collect the

367
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:40,719
material also something interesting I

368
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:45,000
dig up a little bit uh vavo actually

369
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,800
came to gen uh came to IA in 1932 for

370
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,559
the sixth International Congress of

371
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,919
geneticist genetics he was the vice

372
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,518
president for the society at that time

373
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,759
there is basically who is who in

374
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,198
genetics uh both animal and plant

375
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,519
genetics were all in that meeting

376
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,198
including barara MCA

377
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:06,359
uh also in that trip he also went to

378
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:09,318
Geneva he actually um presented two

379
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:13,240
painting of wild Apple from kazakstan

380
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:16,558
and Quan uh to Professor Willington of

381
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,480
experimental station also in 1932 these

382
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:22,639
two painting actually still being

383
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,240
preserved at the Lee library in in

384
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,360
Geneva I just wonder anybody recognize

385
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,160
the building on campus uh maybe he's

386
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,959
still there maybe not

387
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,360
so uh quickly I want to make a pitch uh

388
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,679
why do we need to collect also preserve

389
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,759
wild germ plasm material uh from the

390
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,640
wild because a lot of wild ger plant

391
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:45,160
also native habitat a loss due to

392
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,320
Agricultural Development also uh also

393
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,320
changes in agriculture change uh

394
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:51,759
practices also a lot of Urban

395
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:54,240
Development issue uh a lot of animal

396
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,960
grazing environmental deoration is a

397
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,079
serious issue such as a Sol erosion

398
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,600
reduction in water Supply and quality of

399
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,240
course the climate changes such as

400
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,599
Greenhouse Effect and

401
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,038
deification also a lot of wild CH plasma

402
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,959
material also is is being threatened due

403
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:13,558
to new p and diseases also a lot of time

404
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,759
also invasive species into the native

405
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,519
habitat also a lot of time plant

406
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:21,038
biodiversity also being reduced because

407
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:23,119
agricultural intensification also

408
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,798
agricultural Comm modernization for

409
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:29,000
example uh for the worldwide avocado

410
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:31,798
trade uh basically 95% all the trade

411
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,640
just rely on single variety the has

412
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:36,679
avocado uh similar uh for when you go to

413
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,159
most of the supermarket outside in New

414
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:41,600
York you probably only find about 11

415
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:44,240
apple variety uh you will commonly see

416
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,240
that in the

417
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:50,158
supermarket um Chen from the uh CH oh

418
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,159
excuse

419
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:58,360
me Chen from the uh uh Chinese Academy

420
00:18:54,159 --> 00:19:01,159
of Science uh they did a survey in 2009

421
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,719
they basically compare the native range

422
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:07,240
of

423
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,000
maloi in in Shin Jang China uh compared

424
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,159
with the survey was done all the way

425
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,798
back in

426
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:15,600
1959 basically it found out in

427
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:18,639
comparison between the two uh in the in

428
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:22,279
the time frame of 50 years 80% of the

429
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,520
Native habitat of malesia was lost uh

430
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:27,079
due to Agricultural Development animal

431
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:30,319
grazing a lot of overh harvesting of the

432
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:33,558
wild fruit also a lot of top work of the

433
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:37,439
Native species into a modern variety and

434
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:39,678
also uh new Apple insect problem uh in

435
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,759
that region uh here's picture showing

436
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:46,600
this insect able to attack the m ofi in

437
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:50,240
the wild population and also this is a

438
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:52,158
picture from the uh Apple expiration all

439
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,558
the way to the left to the right to the

440
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,440
left uh when they did a exporation in

441
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,440
Kazakhstan they actually see a lot of

442
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,558
sheep Grazing In the wild Apple Forest

443
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,720
over there uh the picture in the middle

444
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:08,359
is not Apple uh but Aron trees in from

445
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,839
Morocco but you can see um the Sheep

446
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:14,079
really like the Aran tree over

447
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:18,000
there just trying to make a point here

448
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:20,879
okay uh here's a map showing the uh

449
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,279
plant exploration of malesia in Central

450
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,440
Asia by the pl genetic research unit uh

451
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,759
in the late 90 in the in the late 80

452
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,240
into the '90s

453
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:34,798
basically there are 12 major sit uh most

454
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,558
of them actually in kazakstan but

455
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:40,918
there's also s site in kazakstan us

456
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:44,200
bakan also tajan uh here is actually

457
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,600
China this is actually shinjang area uh

458
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,519
the survey uh did was about Native

459
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:50,519
habitat was actually right here in this

460
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,000
region here's a summary about tremendous

461
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,960
amount work on the exploration for

462
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Mali basically there were four trip

463
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,400
together 12 our major site and based on

464
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,839
the phenotype they observe in the field

465
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,000
they actually select 44 they call

466
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:15,000
malesia Elite they got the bwood and

467
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,960
they bring back to the United States

468
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,679
they also collect over uh 894 SE a

469
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,000
session of Malicia from the while that

470
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,840
including basically over 120,000 seeds

471
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,759
together and over 30,000 of those seed

472
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:33,278
was actually distribute to all the

473
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,720
researcher worldwide and uh about 30

474
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:38,480
over 39,000 of the sea actually still

475
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,400
being store at the for colon and over

476
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,200
50,000 of those seeds actually store at

477
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,278
Geneva uh in the last couple years we

478
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,679
also have to collect over 50,000 open

479
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:51,640
pollinated seeds from malesia seeding

480
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,440
block at

481
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,919
Geneva uh we call this the Bony of

482
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,000
Desire seed uh for routine distribution

483
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,960
uh a lot of you probably read the book

484
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,919
by Marco pollen B your desire and uh we

485
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,919
got actually very routine request from

486
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:10,360
the reader uh because in the book

487
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:12,400
mentioned that field Force line is

488
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,798
willing to give out the sea so we

489
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,840
constantly actually get inquiry about

490
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:20,038
Mal seeds and that's the SE we don't

491
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,038
give out SE from here the original SE

492
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:24,798
from the wild collection we actually

493
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:26,278
give out the OPC uh so for the routine

494
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,599
distribution to the

495
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,640
stakeholder uh in the last few year we

496
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:33,439
actually see an increase a lot of

497
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,400
inquiry actually from European country

498
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,000
uh England Germany France uh most recent

499
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,120
was actually from

500
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,079
Finland uh here just show you some of

501
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,798
the picture from the exploration uh back

502
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,798
in the

503
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:51,119
1990s uh they basically uh throughout

504
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,440
the several exploration sometime they

505
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,038
went back to the same location at

506
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,960
different year to collect the material

507
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:00,720
uh Professor dangal is the major Co

508
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,480
cooperated cooperator uh for all the

509
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,360
exploration he actually came to Geneva

510
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,278
in

511
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:08,558
1992 and then the team went back in 93

512
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:12,440
95 and

513
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:15,720
96 uh this is Elizabeth Dickinson uh at

514
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,519
that time she already graduated uh but

515
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,919
she came back to join the

516
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,440
exploration uh sometime they also found

517
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,120
very nice phenotype in the wild and uh

518
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,919
they will collect the bowwood uh they

519
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,479
call that micia Elite bring back to the

520
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,159
United States a lot of places they went

521
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,240
to actually is really remote therefore

522
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,120
the only way they can get to is actually

523
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,120
to helicopter

524
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:45,119
right here's some the picture from the

525
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:47,960
1997 exploration in suon China uh before

526
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:50,199
the exploration Professor Lee uh who was

527
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,919
from the southwest agricultural

528
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,360
University uh he was a leading Authority

529
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:59,559
on wild Mal material in China he came to

530
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:02,519
visit in Geneva in 19 1996 then the team

531
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:06,558
from Geneva went there in 1997 uh

532
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:08,879
professor aleno over there um every

533
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,720
exploration is a little bit different uh

534
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,480
one thing stand out in that particular

535
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,240
exploration was uh there was agreement

536
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,000
that American were not allowed to

537
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,839
collect the fruit in the wild directly

538
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,919
only the Chinese scientists allowed to

539
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:23,158
collect the fruit from the trees then

540
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,320
the American able to participate in

541
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,240
processing the

542
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,879
material um the location they collect

543
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:34,079
the fruit was actually next border to

544
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,360
Tibet so it's a very high altitude so

545
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:39,678
you can see Professor Alo trying to walk

546
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:42,599
up the hill to look at the Yaks that's

547
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,960
the elevation about 4,000 meter that's

548
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:48,558
over 12,000

549
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,278
ft here's on the picture from the 1999

550
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:53,200
exploration in

551
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:54,440
Turkey uh basically you have to do all

552
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,759
kind of thing when you're on the

553
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,600
exploration trip some of them are

554
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,038
found

555
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:03,719
uh here basically the route they took uh

556
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:07,558
in Turkey they start with the city in

557
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:10,278
ismir uh near aanc they first they went

558
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:11,879
up north cover several location and then

559
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:15,159
they double back once again through the

560
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,159
north coming back to

561
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:23,240
air I mentioned sometime we collect the

562
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:26,120
B from the W and to bring that material

563
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,120
back to the US uh basically for

564
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:31,558
importation of Mal J plasm the B

565
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,398
material all the material need to go

566
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:34,398
through from foreign country need to go

567
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:38,038
through the

568
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:39,599
USDA a quarantine process before the

569
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,278
material can come to

570
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:45,079
Geneva uh every year we basically we

571
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:46,759
receive between 10 to 20 session from

572
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:49,798
Avis every

573
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:54,359
year in recent years on the material we

574
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:58,519
got uh uh from AIS uh that including

575
00:25:54,359 --> 00:26:00,439
Mali uh Elite from the exploration also

576
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:02,720
some of the cider apple from Northern

577
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,360
Spain that was introduced by Professor

578
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,798
Ian meran uh also a lot of different

579
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:10,558
variety from different country uh you

580
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:13,278
can see basically from all over the

581
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,119
world uh sometime most of session when

582
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,960
it goes through the AIS quarantine

583
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,759
process they take about a few years but

584
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:24,640
there are some extreme cases especially

585
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:27,798
this case one of the Malia Elite from

586
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,720
Kazan uh was collected in 1996

587
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:34,319
exploration trip it only released by

588
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,000
Avis to us last year after 16 year in

589
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,918
the

590
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,119
quarantine uh that just uh provisionally

591
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,720
release so we have to wait for

592
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:45,959
additional two to three year before its

593
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,720
permanent release to the public so when

594
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,079
it's all set and down probably will take

595
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,679
between 18 to 19 years before this

596
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:55,879
material can be released to the public

597
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:57,798
why was that one so long in quantin

598
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,520
sometime baby just have some disease

599
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:01,519
issue say they need they need to clean

600
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,359
up again go through thermotherapy and

601
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,798
the

602
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:08,479
reindexing uh some sometimes just take

603
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,480
some time some material very

604
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,599
difficult uh now I want to swi switch

605
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,678
gear talking about the preservation of

606
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:20,240
the colal collection at Geneva basically

607
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,278
all the variety and the species we have

608
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,159
we preserve them as the life tree in the

609
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:28,000
field most of them uh for the malas and

610
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:30,640
punas each of the session we have one

611
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,480
mature trees we start with two tree but

612
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,440
in general after several year only keep

613
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,558
one trees for the vas each session we

614
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,000
has two mature fine in the field uh for

615
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:43,678
the wild malice and the vus g plas and

616
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,200
all the wild sea collection from the

617
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,519
while we store them store them at minus

618
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:53,000
20 cold room uh we have one cold room in

619
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:55,519
Geneva also one in four colum a lot of

620
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,278
dor and bwood for the malas also the

621
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,599
punas uh they under long longterm backup

622
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:03,000
storage using choir preservation

623
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:04,599
basically store them in liquid nitrogen

624
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,839
at 4 colon

625
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:09,558
Colorado uh we also have a block

626
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:12,158
material in our collection we call this

627
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:15,960
uh the cor males core collection that

628
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,760
including 250a assession uh that's

629
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:23,000
including majority of the common malus

630
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:25,759
Uh current day uh apple variety but also

631
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,440
other material from 42 other species and

632
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,440
species hybrid

633
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,678
I want to do a Rubio here get some

634
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:43,839
water uh for the collection we have in

635
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:46,319
Geneva we have over 80,000 ession total

636
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:49,798
uh for the Mals collection we have over

637
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:54,960
6,600 assession that including over

638
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:57,798
5,000 uh fuel assession also over 1500 c

639
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,079
assession um in the field we we have

640
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:03,119
several different block we have the B9

641
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:05,558
block that's the mes core collection we

642
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,079
also have two other larger block uh the

643
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:10,158
M7 and the E7 block that's all the

644
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:13,000
material we consider a part of our

645
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,200
permanent collection we also have a K1

646
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,558
block that's the Kazan Mal sesia seaing

647
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,480
block they are on their own Roots uh

648
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,079
it's different from the material in the

649
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,720
three other block they actually on

650
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,879
dwarfing root stock but for all the wild

651
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,399
material they actually on their own root

652
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,399
uh own R system we also have another

653
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:35,000
block we call that W3 block actually a

654
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,158
several different wild models material

655
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,119
uh they come from Armenia China Georgia

656
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,399
kazakstan Russia and

657
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,439
Turkey we also have one block of

658
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:47,639
material that including five different

659
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,480
uh F1 uh population from a cross between

660
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,440
Gaya apple variety cross with five

661
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,240
different model ofi all these five Mali

662
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,519
they actually been shown to have a

663
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,798
different disease resistance system so

664
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:02,000
we consider this more like a

665
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:05,918
pre-breeding population or can use for

666
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,839
mapping population for different

667
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,038
purpose for all our permanent collection

668
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:13,359
in the field uh every single tree in the

669
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:16,720
field and every single Vine in the field

670
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,798
we have a tag associated with each trees

671
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,278
uh basically will tell you which row and

672
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:24,679
trees and uh what's the pi number uh

673
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:27,558
what's the species number also the

674
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:29,919
variety Cove uh for the seaing block

675
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:31,759
material we usually have a tag for every

676
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,120
10 trees or

677
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:38,200
so uh here just show you some of the

678
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:40,959
picture from the Mal CI wild collection

679
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:45,278
uh wild species collection uh this is a

680
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:48,798
picture uh from 2004 both the W3 block

681
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:52,759
and also the K1 block over here in

682
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:56,038
2004 uh here is a similar view uh in 200

683
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:58,839
uh s uh three year later this is a model

684
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:59,679
subi uh different species here is all

685
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:03,199
the

686
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:06,000
maloi from kazakstan well a little bit

687
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,360
wild Vitus different wild species on the

688
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,679
corner there uh here's the view from the

689
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:15,918
uh Kem K1 Block in 2012 last year uh

690
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,038
because they are on their own Roots uh

691
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,320
they are not on dwarfing root stock the

692
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:22,319
material basically are now over 20 ft

693
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,840
High here's picture of uh Field Force

694
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,000
line the first curator together

695
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,720
Professor

696
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
hero looking at the micia material in

697
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,919
the field they spend a lot of time on

698
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,919
those

699
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,440
material here's some of the pictures

700
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,880
showing some of the interest stuff

701
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,558
interesting stuff we have in our

702
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,919
collection for example uh we have some

703
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:50,000
of the large fed malos orent talas from

704
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:52,679
China uh it could be hybrid uh we're not

705
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,480
100% sure uh this material they are very

706
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,919
large food so they have some ornamental

707
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,120
potential uh we also have have uh uh

708
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,799
some material called malice transitoria

709
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:05,439
they also from China they are very dwarf

710
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,398
material also very spreading very

711
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,440
different from most of the wild

712
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:12,479
species um this is one one of the Mal

713
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,000
hybrid material called Butterball it's a

714
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,558
beautiful ornamental material uh it

715
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,759
tastes terrible

716
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:22,079
though uh we also have a small M Nursery

717
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,720
we use for our propagation purpose

718
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,519
purpose uh in our

719
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,360
collection uh basically uh this show a

720
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,200
very standard uh uh malice material in

721
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:36,278
our permanent collection uh we planned

722
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,880
uh over 150 new session last

723
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:42,480
year um we also have a small stew for uh

724
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,639
roostar propagation uh here is a very

725
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,679
interesting material uh it's a very

726
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:50,959
thorny juvenile material from the wild

727
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,919
malus hopenes from China you can see all

728
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,519
the thorny material usually will never

729
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:59,038
see that in commercial Apple uh this

730
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,038
things can puncture through the tire

731
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:04,918
basically uh for the vitus collection we

732
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:07,359
have uh basically uh most of the

733
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,799
material we have they are wild species

734
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,879
also a lot of species hybrid that means

735
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:15,319
between v vus v cross with different

736
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,480
wild species therefore they have a cold

737
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:22,678
tolerance able to stand the weather in

738
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,720
Geneva uh most of the vus V material

739
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,960
that's the common um wine grape table

740
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,200
grape and also some r and grape those

741
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,720
are all house at Davis repository

742
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,759
because the weather is better over there

743
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,720
we have over 1,300 a session in the

744
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:41,000
field and about over 80 C session in the

745
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,000
cold

746
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:47,158
storage here just another few uh of our

747
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,399
basically main uh Fighters collection in

748
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,919
the field with all the models collection

749
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,439
uh in the background uh here is also

750
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,278
another material we have in our

751
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,600
collection is a vus hybrid uh it's a SE

752
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:02,000
material all the best tasting material

753
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,918
we have in the field usually by end of

754
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,079
the season it just

755
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:08,960
disappear uh here's another interesting

756
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:12,239
material it's a wild species actually

757
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:17,199
from China uh Vitus p

758
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:19,559
uh PC Zaki Zaki uh this material is

759
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,319
actually very unique Leaf morphology

760
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:24,639
it's a very deep wedge material that's

761
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,280
only in two species among over 60

762
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,878
species actually have this type of

763
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,879
morphology

764
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:34,159
for tar Cherry collection is actually

765
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,039
relative small collection basically uh

766
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,519
tarer is a deploy species actually it's

767
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:43,000
a it's a hybrid material from Sweet

768
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:46,878
Cherry cross with uh some the wild tety

769
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,679
tetr material for example the fukus uh

770
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:53,000
the punas

771
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:55,119
fosa uh we have 130 uh session in total

772
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,679
tarer is actually a very small industry

773
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,640
owning $40 million in the US

774
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:03,319
compared with the grave industry is over

775
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:05,598
3 million um Apple industry is over

776
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,960
sorry two billion uh 3 billion and2

777
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,160
billion dollar in the US uh most of

778
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,960
tarer actually uh originally from

779
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:15,078
Central in the Eastern Europe and also

780
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,960
from Russia uh majority of the tarer

781
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,839
assession we have actually came from the

782
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,519
Michigan State tar Cherry breeding

783
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:23,519
program that's in charge by Dr Amy

784
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,800
arone uh we done a lot of

785
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:33,000
characterization for the con collection

786
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:36,400
we have uh basically all the assession

787
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,159
pi number all the species number uh

788
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,358
species name the varietal name uh the

789
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:44,440
general description of the material The

790
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,319
Source history uh the pedigree if

791
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,318
there's available also a lot of digital

792
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,519
imaging actually all store at the grin

793
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:54,039
database uh we also carry a lot of

794
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,599
phenotypic also genetic

795
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:58,679
characterization uh also some other work

796
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:01,838
such such as a chemical composition de

797
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:04,440
poity measurement uh disease resistance

798
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,679
gross habit morphological trait and the

799
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,639
phenology trade uh some of the

800
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,279
description about the production also

801
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:12,279
micro salary marker some of the

802
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,960
information we have all store at the

803
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,079
Grand data base uh in the future

804
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,838
hopefully uh we have more GBS

805
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:22,640
information the genotype by sequencing

806
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:25,279
marker data also more food quality data

807
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,358
also the sequencing data in the future

808
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,800
all the information basically searchable

809
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,799
at the G database

810
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,000
website uh for the uh I want to talk

811
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,440
about a lot more about the wild mest

812
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,440
material a lot of evaluation we have

813
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,519
done in the last 20 years uh tremendous

814
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,240
amount of disease evaluation work has

815
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:50,199
been done in the last 20 years uh

816
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:53,479
evaluate against different fire BL scab

817
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:55,719
uh the blue mod uh post Harvest Decay uh

818
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,760
also a lot of work on mapping of uh

819
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:01,519
resistant genes in the uh from the wild

820
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,240
sources uh also a lot of work on drw

821
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,639
Resistance evaluation also cold

822
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,879
hardness uh also a lot of genetic

823
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:11,719
diversity study population study uh also

824
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,039
using the genetic marker trying to

825
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:17,000
determ uh the core collection also using

826
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:20,400
genetic marker trying to identify

827
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:24,199
interpace hybrid also duplicate in our

828
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,000
collection uh we also have uh a lot of I

829
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:28,358
mentioned before uh some of the mapping

830
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,280
populations that could be used for

831
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:31,279
mapping different kind of

832
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:37,960
tray here I want to give you one

833
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:41,000
specific example uh about uh disease

834
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,159
resistance evaluation against Blue mod

835
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
uh this is work between

836
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:49,960
um the appalation fre food research

837
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,519
station uh of USDA at the curing spell

838
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,559
West Virginia together with researcher

839
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:57,880
in volcanic Center and the

840
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,880
pgru uh this particular session uh

841
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,039
actually is been shown to be resistant

842
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,440
against the blue Mo and they came from

843
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:09,079
kazakstan

844
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:13,280
uh in 2011 and 2012 we collect fruit

845
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:15,560
from 101 individual from this F1 mapping

846
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,160
population uh then we inoculate the

847
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:20,920
fruit with a penicillin expension and

848
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:23,879
then we measure the legion size 7 Day

849
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,240
sometime 5 to 7 day after the

850
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:30,000
inoculation there's a huge environmental

851
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:32,279
difference from between 2001 and 2012

852
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,079
but the disease rating across the year

853
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,079
actually highly

854
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,519
correlated uh the qdl mapping for the

855
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:45,079
bloo resistant actually being ma the

856
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:47,800
resistant to uh linkage group uh number

857
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:49,680
four here just pick showing a picture

858
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,640
we're collecting the fruit uh last year

859
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:56,838
in the field for the inoculation

860
00:38:53,639 --> 00:39:00,960
experiment here to show you example of

861
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:04,119
11 fruit uh from uh two one susceptible

862
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,440
and the one resistance uh progeny you

863
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:09,960
can see uh basically after 5 to 7 day

864
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,000
after inoculation uh there's significant

865
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,358
difference in the legion side between

866
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,920
the susceptable material versus the

867
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:16,920
resistant

868
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:23,519
material we also use different genetic

869
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:27,240
marker uh in this particular example we

870
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:29,960
use nine microad marker to study over

871
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:33,639
1900 mes a session we have in our

872
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:37,358
collection uh we're able to identify 238

873
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:39,838
Mal domestica and also 10 other uh model

874
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:43,358
succession they actually share the same

875
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:45,679
genotype based on N SSL marker with at

876
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:48,239
least one other malice domesticat

877
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:50,239
assession in our collection uh once we

878
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,919
find anything with a similar genetic

879
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:55,519
profile we also trying to look into the

880
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,960
through image trying to confirm the

881
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,838
genetic study

882
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,480
result uh in this case we able to

883
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,559
identify total of 23 sport family that

884
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,318
including

885
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:10,599
1004 session uh in the

886
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:13,199
collection also there are some mistake

887
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:15,838
we identify also some duplicate we're

888
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:18,199
able to identify from this

889
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,559
study we also carry out a lot of

890
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:23,159
horiculture and food quality trade

891
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:25,078
evaluation uh in the early year uh our

892
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:26,920
unit actually devote a lot of effort

893
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,640
into choir preservision method

894
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,440
development for the malos and the punas

895
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:35,199
and also together with for Colin they

896
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:38,200
did a lot of study on long-term survival

897
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:40,480
rate of the cryo preservation uh B

898
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:42,719
material uh also in the last couple

899
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,599
years we focus a lot on dig digital

900
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:47,480
image of different the fruit the leaf

901
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:51,160
and flour we upload a lot of image into

902
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:53,760
the grand database we also involve with

903
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:57,118
uh polyphenolic and also antioxidant

904
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,200
capacity study of the vus also we're

905
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,760
working on the malus and the torer right

906
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:05,759
now also uh juice quality and some

907
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,880
specific example like the ref flesh uh

908
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,000
apple and also through Obsession rate of

909
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:13,240
some of the M obession we have here just

910
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,400
show you know different uh Digital Image

911
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:18,279
we have uh for different material in our

912
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,000
collection uh sometime we still have

913
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,800
some Shadow we're trying to improve the

914
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,800
quality of the photo in the near

915
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:30,039
future here just another example of a

916
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:32,960
genetic study of a red flashh apple

917
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:36,318
apple in our collection uh this study

918
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,880
including over 100 session uh basically

919
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:40,719
they have different kind of red flash uh

920
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,480
you can see for the different pattern of

921
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:46,519
red flash uh they have some some of the

922
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,119
ref flash actually uh localized in the

923
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:51,880
KX area some of them actually associate

924
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,160
with the vascular bndo uh some of them

925
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,720
just throughout entire cortex but not

926
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,960
including the core some of them just

927
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:59,838
focus on on the core region and some of

928
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,920
the material actually throughout entire

929
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:05,159
entire fruit so uh there's a lot of

930
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,200
different color different pattern also

931
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:09,799
different intensity among different

932
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:14,719
assession uh we also look

933
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:17,440
at uh the trying to use a PCR trying to

934
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:20,959
identify the myid 10 which is trans

935
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,400
transcription promoter uh that prey has

936
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,639
been mapped to linish linish group uh

937
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,800
number nine uh that's strongly

938
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:30,480
associated is a refresh fuit among all

939
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:33,680
the genotype but this particular uh

940
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,480
promoter is not uh neither sufficient

941
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:39,799
nor requireed for all the refresh uh in

942
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,920
all the genotype expression uh also uh

943
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,760
nearly all the refresh material were

944
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,880
able to test it actually all could be

945
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:49,720
traced back probably a single variety

946
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,160
isasi Anna actually is a well

947
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:55,078
potentially probably a wild material of

948
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,039
malici from Central Asia so all the

949
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:58,720
refres available right now it's actually

950
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:01,119
all could probably Trace back to this

951
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:01,118
single

952
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,119
variety uh last year we also upload a

953
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:09,239
lot of Ploy information based on flow

954
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,838
cytometry also some of the information

955
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:14,439
based on historic information available

956
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:18,078
from the grin we upload uh

957
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,639
682 uh malus domesticat and malus hybrid

958
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:25,079
PL information into the grin uh that

959
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:30,318
including uh 554 deploy material uh 17

960
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:32,599
chimeric uh 91 triplo and uh 20 tetrol

961
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:35,039
we also have flow cytometry information

962
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:39,400
for over uh

963
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:42,239
664 uh while Amal session uh from 53

964
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,039
different species uh deploy is uh a

965
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,919
little bit more different uh some of

966
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:49,719
them uh they have deploy triplo p uh

967
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:53,159
tety all the way into pent Ploy within

968
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:56,078
the same species also we basically we

969
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:57,558
have a micro satellite marker data for

970
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,039
for basically all the permanent

971
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:02,040
assession we have in our collection so

972
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:04,759
in principle we should should be able to

973
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:07,000
infer deploy level from the SSR marker

974
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,000
in the

975
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:14,399
future uh since last year we also

976
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:17,558
initiate uh the malos uh genotype by

977
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,760
sequencing effort uh for our malos

978
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:22,200
collection uh in this study we including

979
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,240
uh over

980
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:28,078
1,950 material uh from our collection in

981
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:29,719
the study that's including over 15 uh,

982
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,039
1400 mod

983
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:33,239
domesticat uh a lot of different wild

984
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:36,358
model

985
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:40,558
species uh all including in the study we

986
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:44,159
use two enzyme uh for restriction uh we

987
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:47,319
have 21 play in total and uh we're just

988
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:50,879
in the beginning uh stage of the data

989
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:54,159
analysis uh for each play uh we have we

990
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,358
able to obtain between 100 to 100 Mil

991
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:59,239
Millions G Ray per play so basically

992
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:02,719
we're doing a lot of sequencing

993
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:05,039
information uh from this study uh in

994
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:07,239
some of the initial analysis we done we

995
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:10,440
using Golden Delicious genome as a

996
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:14,439
reference genome for comparison in

997
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:19,280
analysis uh in that particular study

998
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:21,760
comparison about 40% of the sequence uh

999
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,119
uh actually could not be U mapped back

1000
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,000
to the Golden Delicious genome actually

1001
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:29,318
40% of the sequence we identify

1002
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,639
I found a GBS study actually never been

1003
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:32,920
known

1004
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,679
before uh also in the future we're

1005
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,358
trying to make comparison without any

1006
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:38,199
reference genome so we can we're not

1007
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:40,318
going to create any bias against

1008
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:42,480
especially the wild models

1009
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,800
material uh hopefully in the future we

1010
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,358
can use the data trying to study a lot

1011
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,599
of different question uh domestication

1012
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:52,279
issues still there's some debate over

1013
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,838
there the breeding history gene flow the

1014
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,960
evolution also Gene uh trade assoc

1015
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,838
negotiation I hope something we can do

1016
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,679
in the future and also other issue

1017
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:02,679
relate to the malice

1018
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,838
genome next time to switch gear a little

1019
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,160
bit talking about distribution uh for

1020
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:13,880
the Colona collection every year we

1021
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:17,118
update our catalog for Apple grape and

1022
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:19,318
tar Cherry that's available online uh

1023
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,920
basically all the distribution of free

1024
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:24,440
of charge to the stakeholder uh here

1025
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,000
just summary table of some of the the

1026
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:30,838
number of sample we distribute in the

1027
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:34,358
last 10 year as you can see back in 2007

1028
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:38,639
and 2008 uh in combin with distribute

1029
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:40,880
over 11,000 sample in those two years uh

1030
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,960
in the last two year uh we distribute

1031
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,760
over 9,000

1032
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:50,400
material per year in the last two season

1033
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,400
so that's a lot of work a lot of

1034
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:56,519
material here just a picture showing

1035
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:59,239
we're collecting dor bwood from the s

1036
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:02,400
healing from kazakstan for Drought

1037
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:04,838
resistance study we're cooperating with

1038
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,200
uh this is about 3 weeks ago uh believe

1039
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:08,199
me it was very cold in the

1040
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,280
field uh as I mentioned earlier before

1041
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,480
one of another purpose for the

1042
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:19,160
distribution I see is actually trying to

1043
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,358
pre promote the value of the ger plasm

1044
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:23,719
material we have in our collection

1045
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,920
therefore we carry out a lot of Outreach

1046
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:28,399
education event also a lot of tool

1047
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,960
coming to a colonal collection uh

1048
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,119
basically during the springtime the

1049
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,639
summertime also in the fall season uh so

1050
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,720
far not too many people come in the

1051
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:40,279
winter time uh every year for example

1052
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:42,078
the print plan breeding courses um they

1053
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,440
will come to our collection in the fall

1054
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,760
they will come to Geneva I think when

1055
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,800
they come to our collection they

1056
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,520
probably have the best time uh they all

1057
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,200
very happy they carry our food back to

1058
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:57,000
uh so they all very happy to come to the

1059
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:59,279
collection uh last year also the summer

1060
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,639
scholar student at the station also came

1061
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,280
to look at the collection uh we're able

1062
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:09,639
to have Dr H bro actually talk with

1063
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,640
student about all his exploration

1064
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,440
experience we also carry a lot of Dr

1065
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,280
Plaza exchanges and also visit with

1066
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,838
other je Banks throughout the world for

1067
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,839
example this miss yunyang her uh she is

1068
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:25,239
the great curator and also molecular

1069
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:27,440
Genesis for the South Korean Jin Bank uh

1070
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:30,358
she's spent about 3 months with us last

1071
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,880
year uh she's back in South Korea uh in

1072
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:34,519
the future hopefully we're going to

1073
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,680
start exchanging material especially the

1074
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:38,920
wild Vitus material between the two two

1075
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:41,440
Gene

1076
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,800
Bank uh here's kind of in the summary

1077
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,358
basically uh the shortterm goal we have

1078
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,920
for the colal collection in the next

1079
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:49,719
couple years uh first of all we like to

1080
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,358
continue Digital Imaging of the

1081
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:55,318
collection we can always uh taking more

1082
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:57,798
photo uh also we are trying to finish

1083
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:59,239
the evaluation of Vitus phology we

1084
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:01,679
already have two-year data we're going

1085
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:03,679
to do that for additional two years also

1086
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:06,719
we're going to start the the malus

1087
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:09,358
phology evaluation uh hopefully for the

1088
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:11,959
next three years uh we're continuing on

1089
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:14,880
on the food quality also in nutritional

1090
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:17,960
evaluation for the malice and tar Cherry

1091
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,119
uh the work we start started since last

1092
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:23,880
year uh we also going to carry out a gap

1093
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:28,039
analysis for the malus also Vitus ger

1094
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:30,318
plasm material using different G uh Geo

1095
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:33,119
referencing data the climate data also

1096
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:35,279
genomic data when it's available uh once

1097
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,519
we're able to finish the Gap analysis in

1098
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:41,359
our collection uh we intend trying to uh

1099
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:43,880
begin collection for uh more

1100
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:44,960
systematically uh for the North American

1101
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,000
vus

1102
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,960
material uh uh which we think we really

1103
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,440
should focus on for the next couple

1104
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,559
years uh also potentially will probably

1105
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,720
trying to collect additional material

1106
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,839
from the North American and mil species

1107
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:02,519
uh we have four different species in

1108
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:05,759
North America I going to continue trying

1109
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:07,719
to apply the GBS marker uh for the malis

1110
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,880
and also tar Cherry genome

1111
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:13,159
analysis uh probably more tra

1112
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:15,559
Association analysis and also probably

1113
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:19,318
potentially a Leo mining for a lot of

1114
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:22,640
wild Mal and also the V Mal and tarer

1115
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:24,519
material we have also we cooperating

1116
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:26,279
with with a lot of different people we

1117
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:28,798
continue on

1118
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,440
uh evaluation of all a lot of wild

1119
00:50:28,798 --> 00:50:34,079
material of the malus also the vus

1120
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,159
material uh based on those evaluation

1121
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,720
result we're going to trying to select

1122
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:41,639
some of the material to be included in

1123
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:43,558
our permanent uh collection uh in the

1124
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:46,239
next 5

1125
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:48,119
years uh some of the long-term goal we

1126
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:50,719
have for the colal collection uh first

1127
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:53,000
of all we hope we can carry out genetic

1128
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:55,919
study among our genan bank together with

1129
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,159
Gan Bank in other countries uh hope that

1130
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:01,519
will lead to Future exchange of material

1131
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:03,838
in the future also trying to uh exchange

1132
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:06,798
and exploration maybe the wild malus and

1133
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:08,519
also virus material especially in China

1134
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:11,239
uh potentially in turkey and other

1135
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:13,159
places we like to complete the long-term

1136
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:15,798
backa storage for all the malice and

1137
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:18,879
tarch area session and trying to develop

1138
00:51:15,798 --> 00:51:21,000
a a very good reliable uh long-term

1139
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,440
backup storage method for virus which we

1140
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,519
don't have right now also additional

1141
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,920
genotyping and phenotyping of all the

1142
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:30,639
Wild G plasma material we have in our

1143
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,159
collection we like to reduce the disease

1144
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,879
level in our field

1145
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:37,239
collection uh hopefully trying to uh

1146
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,640
look into longterm trying to develop a a

1147
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:41,558
new strategy uh for long-term

1148
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:44,199
preservation of the colonal material we

1149
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:46,960
have uh because we probably facing

1150
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:49,519
facing a potential limiting space issue

1151
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,280
also resources issue in the

1152
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:54,119
future uh finally I want to acknowledge

1153
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,119
all the people involved with the program

1154
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:59,720
for the last 30 years especially a group

1155
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:02,480
of guys I work with every day uh we call

1156
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:04,519
them the 18 uh they are four guy that

1157
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,960
actually work on a collection day in and

1158
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:10,519
out basically doing all the work and

1159
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,720
also other people from the pgru and also

1160
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:16,000
uh former curator Phil forine Professor

1161

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,440
involved with the long-term choir back

1167
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:35,000
backup storage and also all the folks at

1168
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:38,079
pgru and ggu and also the field Research

1169
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,239
Unit of a conal University at the Geneva

1170
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,720
Station uh throughout the year they gave

1171
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:45,439
a lot of help also all the folks at

1172
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:48,039
konal University and finally the funding

1173
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:51,039
support from the national three project

1174
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:54,239
project and also the inai uh Regional

1175
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:55,409
experimental station founding thank

1176
00:52:54,239 --> 00:53:00,609
you

1177
00:52:55,409 --> 00:53:00,609
[Applause]

1178
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:07,279
uh the question uh was has the Apple

1179
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:10,680
genome be sequenced uh how we in that

1180
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:13,720
case uh how I refer to Golden Delicious

1181
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:16,480
how how we're going to use that uh yes

1182
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:19,078
uh there's a published sequence uh based

1183
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,920
on Golden Delicious uh that's what we

1184
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:25,480
use for our comparison some of the

1185
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,318
material uh the GBS data we have but I'm

1186
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:31,000
not an expert in the area but the

1187
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:33,679
discussion is um uh because throughout

1188
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,719
the domestication history if you simply

1189
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:39,199
use Golden Delicious genome sequence as

1190
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:41,798
your reference genome uh we do have a

1191
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,919
lot of wild malice material that's

1192
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:46,239
probably not involved with domestication

1193
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,318
of the Golden Delicious the malice

1194
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:50,719
domesticat so if you use Golden

1195
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:52,480
Delicious as a base for comparison

1196
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,558
you're going to be biased against a lot

1197
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,679
of wild material so we're going to try

1198
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,440
to use gold Golden Delicious sequence as

1199
00:53:56,679 --> 00:54:02,239
a comparison uh but also we're trying to

1200
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,599
do other comparison without any uh

1201
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,118
Golden Delicious Golden Delicious genome

1202
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:09,119
sequence so we're not create any bios

1203
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,440
we're still working on that a lot of

1204
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:14,440
other issue involve for example uh Tri

1205
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:17,838
Ploy is a very serious issue uh poly

1206
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:20,440
Ploy is very difficult for GBS analysis

1207
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:23,078
right now most of the methodology my

1208
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:26,039
understanding is is developed for deploy

1209
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:28,359
so we have we do have a lot the polyol

1210
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:30,318
material and also especially the trio

1211
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:32,679
material that can create a lot of

1212
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:36,679
problem so we're still working on

1213
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:38,960
that uh do we have a problem with foser

1214
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:41,598
disease yes we do in the field we do

1215
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,240
have different disease that's always a

1216
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,480
concern um but it's very difficult

1217
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,719
because it's open fuel collection so

1218
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,559
it's never been

1219
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:52,239
clean

1220
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:55,319
um and we don't really have a resources

1221
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:59,399
to testing material all the time uh so

1222
00:54:55,318 --> 00:55:01,639
it's always a issue I do mention that um

1223
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,639
for the foreign distribution all the

1224
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:05,719
material we send out have to go through

1225
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:09,719
the quarantine process of the receiving

1226
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:12,358
country but in the United States uh at

1227
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:16,759
least for the M that's not the

1228
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:20,199
case uh the question is yeah uh the

1229
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:22,960
question is if any uh plan for

1230
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:26,239
mutagenesis analysis of some of the

1231
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:29,318
collection uh there are some research

1232
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:33,078
involved with for the vus material by

1233
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:35,759
the ggu folks uh they are doing some

1234
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:37,559
mutation uh to qu looking for certain

1235
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,440
muton they are looking for that some of

1236
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:45,000
the material uh but not for malice

1237
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:48,599
now uh yes you're right the main disease

1238
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,719
problem we have is a fire blight uh

1239
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:53,280
potentially uh of course right now we

1240
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:55,759
rely on chemical

1241
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,559
control but that's already always

1242
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,480
difficult chemical control and also plus

1243
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,519
the pruning hopefully potentially we can

1244
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:07,639
look into some other strategy

1245
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:09,719
maybe uh cover crop for example that's a

1246
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:12,358
possibility trying to hopefully can

1247
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:16,239
reduce the disease level in the in the

1248
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:19,199
orer but it's always a balance between

1249
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:22,798
um how much resources we have what how

1250
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:25,719
much we can do uh we're pretty much uh

1251
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:27,920
stretch everything right now uh for the

1252
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:31,838
work we have to do

1253
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,838
so always appreciate more
