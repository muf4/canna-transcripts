1
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,920
our speaker today is Bob schindelbeck

2
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,598
he's an extension associate in the

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,400
department of crop and soil science at

4
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,679
Cornell University with responsibilities

5
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:32,439
in research teaching and extension Bob

6
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:35,119
coordinates the Cornell soil Health

7
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,840
laboratory operations and has been part

8
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,439
of the Cornell soil Health team's

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,640
development of soil management

10
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:43,558
strategies to address laboratory

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,679
measured soil constraints he's produced

12
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,000
a number of uh peer-reviewed and

13
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,079
extension articles and has delivered

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,198
over 200 presentations related to

15
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,719
tillage soil compaction and soil quality

16
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:58,280
at Farmer Twilight meetings and

17
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,198
professional conferences Bob's going to

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,239
talk to us today about soil health

19
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,959
management with that Bob I'm going to

20
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,319
turn the program over to you thank you

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,319
Jeff I hope everyone can hear me okay um

22
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,679
right so two weeks ago I kind of

23
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,758
introduced the uh Cornell soil Health

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,960
test uh in a presentation called

25
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,438
applying the Cornell soil Health test to

26
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,798
Berry production and I'm going to build

27
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,959
on that today uh the title of today's

28
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,118
presentation is understanding the soil

29
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,359
biological and physical properties with

30
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:31,920
a special emphasis on the

31
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:31,920
management so

32
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:38,359
move forward

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,439
here so when we talk about um any sort

34
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:43,159
of soil management we find it very

35
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,519
useful to break the soil into if you

36
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,320
will these great groups the physical

37
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:51,039
biological and chemical properties uh

38
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,879
the reason for that is that soil ecology

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,520
itself is exceedingly complex and uh

40
00:01:53,879 --> 00:02:00,599
full of uh so much so much interaction

41
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,798
that our only chance is to use the

42
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,599
reduction reductionist approach of

43
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,159
Science and kind of understand the the

44
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,799
little bits um and at the same time

45
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,280
realize we're going to have to put those

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,200
little bits back together into the the

47
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,000
whole ecological package uh so that's

48
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,399
kind of the strategy uh that we use uh

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,199
for understanding the soil itself as

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,599
scientists then we we take that sort of

51
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,518
knowledge and strategy and then manage

52
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:32,518
the soil to uh the manage these

53
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,439
different properties of the soil then to

54
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,200
get the sort of interactions moving in

55
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,479
the direction we want so the uh the

56
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,518
power of management or wise management

57
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,598
is understanding what's what's beneath

58
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,080
it so uh we kind of model that strategy

59
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:48,479
with this uh with the approach I'm going

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,640
to go through

61
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,679
here so um just kind of visit in a

62
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:58,039
nutshell here our our philosophy really

63
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,640
is that this that a healthy soil uh is

64
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:02,280
balanced between the um the blue disc

65
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,399
the yellow disc and the green disc you

66
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,199
see on the right uh we see that as a

67
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,439
three-legged stool of these different

68
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:10,119
soil properties that we want to

69
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,239
understand what's going on in each of

70
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,000
these Realms such that our stool is

71
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,080
balanced and um not weak at one place or

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,239
another and so what we talked about last

73
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,040
week was measuring different indicators

74
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:25,000
in these different uh soil Arenas uh to

75
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:27,639
find out if we have any limitations then

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,039
we take that same understanding of

77
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,759
perhaps impaired processes if they do

78
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:36,639
exist and we when we manage the soil we

79
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:39,039
can address those ideally several at a

80
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,798
time and I've produced a caveat down

81
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,798
here at the bottom of this slide which

82
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,438
kind of gets at really the underpinnings

83
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,760
of all this um a person would say why

84
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:50,598
would you want to increase your soil

85
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:53,759
Health well certainly it's at the very

86
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:56,039
um end of things has to be uh money

87
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,679
increased profitability we want to be uh

88
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,078
more successful with our with our

89
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,920
management and so again part one would

90
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,879
be to identify these soil limitations

91
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,000
and then when we can understand it and

92
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,199
see just what's going on it gives us a

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,360
chance to uh create opportunities what I

94
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,359
call for synergistic management we know

95
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,040
there's a lot of work to do out there

96
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,560
and we want to make sure that all our

97
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,040
all our steps uh all our all our

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:26,478
practices are addressing if if necessary

99
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,479
several issues at once that need uh

100
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,799
addressing so we saw uh this sort of

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,399
strategy last week the the main goals um

102
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,199
Now using this uh Cornell soil Health

103
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,918
test which you see on the right of the

104
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,478
slide uh as we want to understand uh

105
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,319
these different processes going on in

106
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:48,279
the soil and just just how just how our

107
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:50,439
soils uh kind of doing uh seeing what

108
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:52,079
these where these levels are at find out

109
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,360
where where we need really need to focus

110
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,639
our attention but then part two is where

111
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,680
we'll spend our time today or a lot of

112
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,800
our time uh thinking how can we then uh

113
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,720
velop management strategies uh that are

114
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,759
holistic that consider all these things

115
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,280
simultaneously to restore our soil

116
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,680
function and you'll notice we have the

117
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,519
uh the cornal soil test report field

118
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,680
management sheet at the bottom left and

119
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,839
you see some folks uh in a classroom

120
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,800
setting where we actually go through and

121
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,198
we we practice this uh where we take a a

122
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,000
soil Health Report like you see in the

123
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,000
upper right um and kind of break it down

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,199
into four steps and kind of tease out as

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,199
much information as we can on this part

126
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,960
one so that we can develop uh again a

127
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,680
sound manage sound and satisfying uh

128
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,680
management strategy uh if you note the

129
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,360
um so Health Report you see in the upper

130
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,840
right um what we have here is a a a

131
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,280
grower who had Ry vetch three years ago

132
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,000
on a field and then two years of

133
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,559
strawberries it's a Sandy LOM soil and

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,759
you can see that there's some a couple

135
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,600
of uh where you see these red scores um

136
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,879
we've outlined some soil Health uh

137
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,080
constraints some soil processes that

138
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,759
that aren't aren't quite up to snu that

139
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,279
we could address to their management and

140
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,598
we'll come back to this uh at the end of

141
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,239
the end of the talk uh and actually

142
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:12,680
tease this apart and use this um this

143
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,240
four-step strategy to kind of dissect

144
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,038
this and uh I'll just give a an example

145
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,240
uh dissection of the information and a a

146
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:25,759
movement forward through uh through the

147
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,759
four steps to a um proposed management

148
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,519
strategy okay so let me begin uh we're

149
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:32,879
going to talk about a lot about organic

150
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:36,478
matter today so this is a very useful

151
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,959
slide to kind of put things um into our

152
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:42,199
our perspective of how we're of how we

153
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:44,519
think about organic matter so I guess

154
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,478
this probably all makes sense to us by

155
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:50,000
now uh if you're interested in in soil

156
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:52,079
processes but as we feed the soil this

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,360
organic matter we affect a lot of

158
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,719
different processes and I'm outlined

159
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,199
here in in blue soil physical processes

160
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,879
that are directly affected by uh organic

161
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,400
matter U modific additions and

162
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,639
Transformations as well as in green some

163
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,439
soy biological processes that are

164
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:13,879
directly affected by organic matter and

165
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:17,199
of course these are in fact processes

166
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:20,240
that we test in the soil Health uh

167
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,199
analysis uh each one of these has a um

168
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,560
has an analysis that gets gets right at

169
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,280
uh These Nuts and Bolts of uh soil

170
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,240
function but at the same time now we

171
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,318
need to think also as managers so when

172
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,680
we say add organic matter and all these

173
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,400
processes that are affected well

174
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,160
certainly different organic matter could

175
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,439
affect some of these processes more than

176
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,680
other organic matter be the character of

177
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:48,560
the organic matter the age of it do we

178
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,519
stir it in uh do we apply it to the

179
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,399
surface do we grow it in as a uh green

180
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:57,719
manure Etc so that's uh that's where we

181
00:07:54,399 --> 00:08:00,079
where we'll go today um again it's a uh

182
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,560
it it asks for really

183
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,439
uh holding these processes in your mind

184
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,120
uh that are going on in the soil

185
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:12,439
simultaneous with uh the idea of

186
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,959
managing them with um very outside the

187
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:17,800
soil

188
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:17,799
um actions by a

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,879
grower okay so uh to step back a little

190
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:28,679
bit um the there's some actors in This

191
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,560
soil food web uh uh starting with

192
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,120
organic matter on the far left we've got

193
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,679
uh living roots and CHS which they are

194
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,360
organic they're not dead organic matter

195
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,679
but they're living organic matter and

196
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,158
below that we see dead substrate so

197
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:46,719
we've got the the source of all our uh

198
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:50,838
soil um biological processes really is

199
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,040
is the plant um and so we we um want to

200
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,399
keep in mind that these are quite

201
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,240
variable we have different plants that

202
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,000
we can use in our management uh

203
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,480
different substrates that we can apply

204
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,120
so when we we look at this table we see

205
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,639
that uh from the blue circle the living

206
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,399
uh living material we're going to affect

207
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,439
certain living bacteria and fungi and

208
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,559
nematodes in the soil and same at the

209
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,800
bottom the dead substrate can affect

210
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:22,000
this uh this next box this Nev next

211
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:26,078
hierarchy of um

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,399
organisms but right the fact that we can

213
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:32,799
affect and promote certain of these uh

214
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,679
organisms or um actually restrict them

215
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,399
based on our choice of organic matter

216
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,838
forces us then as managers to to be

217
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,159
aware of of all the um all the influence

218
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,920
we can have by modifying what we see at

219
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,919
the far left the living and dead

220
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,078
substrates so to kind of put that in

221
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,639
text here U all organic matter is not

222
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:54,199
created equal I'll use this title on

223
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,278
another slide later in the talk to kind

224
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,560
of bring this uh together uh once again

225
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,720
but um when we when we're dealing with

226
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:03,958
fresh material uh this this could be

227
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,920
additions like grass clippings or leaves

228
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:09,799
as well as uh growing uh cover crops the

229
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:13,679
crop itself uh GRE if you will green

230
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:17,399
manure um these these uh compounds are

231
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,078
very young and fresh and wet uh when

232
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,958
organisms attack this and when these

233
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:24,719
products break down we get a lot of

234
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:26,439
these um glues if you will that uh help

235
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,839
bind the soil together we talked about

236
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,440
this with soil aggregate uh creation

237
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,320
very important W even earthworms as they

238
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,639
pull this material into the soil the the

239
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,720
goo and glue on the earthworm itself

240
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,519
helps hold soil particles together this

241
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,560
is really an early function of organic

242
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,078
matter as it goes through its uh through

243
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,239
its uh cycles of

244
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:51,958
breakdown this fresh material really

245
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,720
favors what I call bacterial

246
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:58,039
populations um they really take off on

247
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,680
this this carbon energy um and we've

248
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,439
seen of course uh nitrogen

249
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:06,120
immobilization um and where nitrogen is

250
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,399
made unavailable to plants because the

251
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,879
competition by these bacteria is so

252
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,600
great for the nitrogen that the plants

253
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:17,360
can can be uh plants can suffer so this

254
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:21,360
is just a um one of the properties of of

255
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,959
fresh material um on the other hand

256
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,519
composts and here I mean uh kind of an

257
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:31,039
extreme sense compost uh uh everything

258
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,879
from um p build up leaves uh bio salads

259
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:36,199
isas biochar um Municipal stockpiles

260
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,278
these sort of

261
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,959
long-term um you know produced composts

262
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,759
that could be trucked and brought in um

263
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:47,239
what we see here are typically more

264
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,559
stable composts than more stable

265
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,879
material than the fresh material and

266
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:55,638
what's happened is the um the comp this

267
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,399
composting has taken place in a pile

268
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,079
when we add the fresh material in

269
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,360
contrast the composting is so to speak

270
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:05,359
is taking place out in the field in situ

271
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,399
right in the right in all these little

272
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,120
micr places in the field when we produce

273
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,278
a compost of course a lot of those these

274
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,278
early um uh processes nitrogen

275
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:18,000
immobilization for example is taking

276
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:21,799
place in the pile which of course we can

277
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,120
manage uh to produce a a a net uh final

278
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,719
product compost but the idea is we're

279
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,159
we're producing something where these

280
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,800
these early processes have already taken

281
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,719
place

282
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,958
um so these then these uh uh the

283
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,399
products that we put on the the added

284
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:40,719
compost then is more stable which is

285
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,839
what we get ultimately from the the

286
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,160
breakdown of the fresh material that

287
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,680
ultimately becomes more stable but here

288
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,198
we're we're kind of short circuiting

289
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:52,239
that by making by doing it in a

290
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:54,719
pile but also uh the last sentence here

291
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,959
under composts uh we can also

292
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,800
concentrate uh nitrogen and phosphate um

293
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:03,399
in the compost and come up with actually

294
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,278
a quite Rich material so we have to be

295
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,278
aware of that as

296
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:12,958
well okay so U we see that these

297
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,839
biological processes then uh that we see

298
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,239
in the soil are going to be affected by

299
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,839
the uh the type of organic matter so how

300
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:25,399
much fuel uh this living fresh material

301
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:27,079
uh is in is in the um the source organic

302
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,198
matter and how much is already in a

303
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:31,159
stable or passive condition which um

304
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:35,679
isn't

305
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:38,480
necessarily uh food for organisms and uh

306
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:40,958
it's it's more of a inert loosening

307
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,240
compound and of course in our soil we

308
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:46,919
have existing soil organisms that we can

309
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,720
that will be affected by this material

310
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:51,719
that we add uh that we give to them in

311
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,199
our management and of course we can

312
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,278
affect that and the way we affect that

313
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:59,758
is uh with management is what we'll be

314
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:03,120
talking about but this they these these

315
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:06,800
two um these two actors here um interact

316
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,320
through moisture temperature how we mix

317
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:12,319
them together or for example tillage um

318
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,278
the fertility level particularly

319
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,399
nitrogen um can affect how fast these

320
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:23,679
things turn over Etc so let's get right

321
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:25,559
to that so here it is in a nutshell

322
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,638
different plants and plant debris

323
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,599
composition is going to affect our soil

324
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:33,440
biology and this is where we need to do

325
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:38,720
a lot of thinking and learning um about

326
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:40,279
new new varieties um new uh for example

327
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,680
in the cover crap Arena what I wanted to

328
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:45,159
say is that um I'm sure you're all aware

329
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:48,479
now of these crucifers these mustards uh

330
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:50,958
that can have um compounds associated

331
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,159
with them that we can use to our

332
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,319
advantage to control organisms in the

333
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,759
soil we've seen that um any number of

334
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,879
times now in potatoes even in

335
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,759
strawberries um that we can kind of

336
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,078
manage our and and choose a cover crop

337
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,680
then that has a has a byproduct of its

338
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,799
breakdown that can affect affect the

339
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:15,159
soil biology so that that's a um kind of

340
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:18,319
an example of how we can um

341
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:19,360
modify the biotic Community to suppress

342
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,360
a

343
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,480
disease but at the same time when we U

344
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,839
build the soil with a cover crop we're

345
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,278
also keeping in mind that we're making a

346
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,600
by making a healthier plant we can

347
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:35,679
sometimes simply outgrow um a

348
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,000
lowlevel a low level of uh disease

349
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,000
organisms in the

350
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,759
soil and the way this is done is that

351
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,159
the plant itself um can produce

352
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:48,318
defensive compounds uh that stress pests

353
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,719
or the plants can enhance beneficial

354
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:54,838
organisms so it's not just what we do

355
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,879
the plant itself is um is acting to um

356
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,440
protect itself and I'd like to go

357
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,078
through that a little here so the

358
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,519
uh I think we all know that the plant

359
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:07,039
root root modifies the rise of spere

360
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:10,639
environment so the way I like to think

361
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:13,439
about it is um not unlike a a tree uh

362
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,799
growing out in a uh in a field that as

363
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,279
it pulls nutrients out of the ground it

364
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:23,078
grows leaves and then drops those leaves

365
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:26,360
ultimately onto that same soil so it's

366
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:29,318
in a it the plant in fact does very

367
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,879
overtly modify its environment uh its

368
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:34,039
soil environment by pulling nutrients

369
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:36,439
out turning them into leaves dropping

370
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:39,120
the leaves as those leaves break down

371
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,880
compounds are released that help the

372
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,879
plant

373
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:05,119
in the photo at the bottom left in fact

374
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:10,119
some estimates are suggest that even um

375
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:14,318
even up to 50% of plant uh photosynthate

376
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:17,279
uh is used in um underground to not only

377
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,438
grow roots and uh the the dry matter of

378
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,359
the roots but that the root is actually

379
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,600
giving these cells if you will uh this

380
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:28,119
energy to the environment in the risos

381
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:31,359
spere just like it's giving leaves um in

382
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:34,038
the fall to the soil above ground so the

383
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:36,399
root tip loses some of these cells these

384
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:39,279
uh epithelial cells as it moves through

385
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,600
the soil and then as these cells die

386
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,079
they they break open and release release

387
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,798
their contents into the risos spere

388
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:50,918
these cells can become food directly or

389
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:54,798
they can simply dissolve uh nutrients in

390
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:58,320
the rizosphere zone um and make them

391
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:01,359
available to the succeeding cells living

392
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:04,359
cells in the root tip these cells can

393
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,918
release compounds that um are

394
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:09,839
antagonistic to disease organisms in the

395
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:13,280
vicinity um this is a very direct effect

396
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:16,319
but the these um these cells and and the

397
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:19,279
plant is really working again in its own

398
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,279
in its own best

399
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:29,240
interest and the reason for this is is

400
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:31,798
that the um this root tip is kind of the

401
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,279
pilot uh going through the going through

402
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:37,679
the soil um it doesn't take up much

403
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,960
water or nutrients where that happens is

404
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,919
further up the root so where I show the

405
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,840
root section and the root hair on the

406
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,799
top part of the slide I'm actually

407
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,038
suggesting that we kind of put this all

408
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:49,599
together into one picture and imagine

409
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:52,119
that behind the root tip then as the

410
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,439
root tip's passing into the soil the

411
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,319
section behind that uh is where the

412
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,080
these root hairs developed these root

413
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:02,879
hairs are single uh single cells uh that

414
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:05,399
are very um effective at uptaking water

415
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,360
nutrients and remember this uh the

416
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,038
environment they're growing into has

417
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:12,479
been affected already by these um

418
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:14,759
slopping off cells of the root

419
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,798
tip of course these root hairs are what

420
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:21,319
get infected by Rise uh by risia

421
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:23,720
bacteria in nitrogen uh fixation in uh

422
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:27,558
in a lot of the legumes also these root

423
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,240
hairs um entwined with fungal melium uh

424
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:32,879
which is very important for for um

425
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,558
increased capture and again increased

426
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,960
surface area for capture of nutrients

427
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,158
and water ultimately these root hairs

428
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,960
will burst and release their release

429
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:44,360
compounds uh into the soil again

430
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,319
dissolving uh dissolving uh the soil to

431
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:50,158
release nutrients um releasing compounds

432
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:52,519
that again affect um antagonists in the

433
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,159
soil and provide an environment

434
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,639
favorable to the next root hair that

435
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,600
moves into that that

436
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,600
zone

437
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,879
okay so um I wanted to talk a little bit

438
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:07,918
about um just very broad sense here a

439
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,520
lot of interest in these uh different

440
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,440
fields these days of a bacterially

441
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:16,038
dominated system and fungally fungal

442
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,759
dominated system um and this is very

443
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:20,798
broad sense U but it's I think it's a

444
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,158
useful strategy to kind of keep these

445
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,720
keep some of these IDE ideas in mind so

446
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,440
we said before that the bacteria are

447
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,279
very fast acting um their population

448
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,080
changes very quickly

449
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:37,119
um the they're at the the root of um the

450
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:39,599
way we manage most um annual field crops

451
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,079
we're counting on these bacteria um what

452
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,839
we what they're doing then is using the

453
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:47,639
last year's and previous years's organic

454
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:50,720
material and mineralizing that into

455
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,720
often um plant available

456
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,640
materials and tillage promotes that um

457
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,759
because it stir the soil and provides um

458
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:04,480
fresh fresh opportunities for bacteria

459
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:06,679
to meet fresh organic matter so the

460
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,558
bacteria don't move very far but when we

461
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,120
till we of course add air and oxygen uh

462
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:13,759
but we also provide new opportunities

463
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,959
for the uh for the bacteria and the

464
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,038
result of this is we get as these

465
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,880
processes continue we get somewhat

466
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:24,480
stable uh humic carbon

467
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:28,679
compounds that are somewhat recal citrin

468
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,880
and can build up into our long-term

469
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:35,400
total organic matter accumulation in the

470
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:38,799
soil but we see more of that in a more

471
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,440
fungally dominated system simply because

472
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:44,200
when we're stirring we always provide

473
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,919
yet another chance to take this uh this

474
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,759
longterm material and have something get

475
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:53,360
at it so in a fungally dominated system

476
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:55,879
now we've kind of moved past this these

477
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:58,879
early stages of of breakdown and the

478
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,200
fungus I see them as somewhat slower I

479
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,520
don't mean that directly but um they're

480
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:08,000
more um if you will more deliberate in

481
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,158
the the these systems in their approach

482
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,519
to using the the nutrients that are

483
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,960
there uh they take a little bit longer

484
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:18,240
to associate they're uh uh they're not

485
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,000
just um the the these organisms don't

486
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,640
necessarily just float around in the

487
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,839
soil they they're while they're in the

488
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,278
soil they're looking for a a

489
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,558
relationship uh to a PL to a plant or to

490
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,440
the material where the bacteria are just

491
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,240
really more

492
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,038
opportunists uh we talked about how

493
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,000
these then as these funguses develop

494
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:40,200
these relationships uh that they um

495
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,798
produce a wide network of Mycelia that

496
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,640
can

497
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:47,879
um uh increase not only uptake of water

498
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:52,000
nutrients for the plant but also protect

499
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,278
the plant against uh outside uh attack

500
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,480
uh by by disease

501
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:59,880
organisms and since these these

502
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,759
associations uh are more complex they

503
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,320
develop a little more slowly and uh they

504
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,359
require not so much of this uh

505
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:09,558
favoritism towards the bacterial end the

506
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,439
rapid the rapid turnover but in

507
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,278
undisturbed or permaculture environments

508
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,840
or what we might see in a more of a

509
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:18,159
berry situation uh there's time for

510
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:21,038
these uh these infections and uh

511
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,360
long-term associations to to develop and

512
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:26,879
because of that then we have a chance

513
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:29,678
for a more complex carbon sequestration

514
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,240
uh in in the more complex compounds what

515
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,278
we would call humification then and we

516
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,200
can produce uh compounds that really um

517
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:42,038
sequester carbon over the long term um

518
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:44,919
and uh help our soil with these um with

519
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:47,679
the with the processes that are more

520
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:52,000
associated with uh this what we called

521
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:55,000
last week the very dead stable organic

522
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,720
compounds right so kind of a um fun

523
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
little slide I made here I show some

524
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,839
people uh collecting leaves into a leaf

525
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,720
pile in the this last fall and across

526
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:07,720
the top uh they simply pile them up and

527
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,000
don't stir them and at the end of at the

528
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,120
end of a year the next fall we see that

529
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,359
the the pile is about 2third as high as

530
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,759
it was the year

531
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:18,918
before uh not many of the leaves have

532
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:20,839
broken down they've uh the weight of

533
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:22,440
snow and rain is has kind of compressed

534
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:25,038
some of the air out of it but we haven't

535
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,919
had a whole lot of a lot of breakdown

536
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,960
and so my CO2 Evolution out the top of

537
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,759
these

538
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,798
um these boxes uh is smaller at the

539
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,038
bottom we show a leaf pile the same leaf

540
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:37,359
pile being collected but we're doing a

541
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:39,359
lot of stirring so we're going to turn

542
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:42,119
our compost pile uh provide

543
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:46,240
opportunities to move uh bacteria into

544
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:49,839
zones of fresh material to attack uh and

545
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,558
breakdown and Etc and we see because of

546
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,839
that then we're getting going to have a

547
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:55,200
lot more carbon dioxide release so we're

548
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:56,879
going to increase our respiration

549
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,759
through this through this opportunity of

550
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,240
the bacteria and as we release carbon

551
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:05,640
dioxide we move through the soil food

552
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,359
web to if you will uh more complex uh

553
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,240
carbon compounds the simple ones being

554
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,240
used up by the bacteria

555
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,440
um and of course I think we all know the

556
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:21,720
the model of the carbon cycle but I put

557
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,440
this up because I I really see the it as

558
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,519
being a balancing act between the the

559
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,640
top Arrow the top orange arrow and the

560
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,839
bottom orange arrow Arrow so on the one

561
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,200
hand we're composing we're taking carbon

562
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:38,759
dioxide from the atmosphere and

563
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,840
composing um carbon into um into sugars

564
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:42,960
cellulose and starch um and on the other

565
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:45,359
hand we're

566
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,919
decomposing through the respiration of

567
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,678
soil microbes decomposing this organic

568
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,880
matter back to carbon

569
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,919
dioxide and it's this spinning uh this

570
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,360
the rapid spinning of this as I was

571
00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:00,320
saying is the is what's favored by the

572
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,959
um the bacteria and when these when

573
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:05,678
these cellulose and starch compounds are

574
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,278
can be more complex or or just different

575
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,880
we're going to affect the the soil

576
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,319
microbes then that would that would be

577
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,880
able or want to or rapidly decompose

578
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:16,918
them so I just I kind of like this this

579
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,679
sort of a concept to think about um

580
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:22,038
composing and decomposing and what we're

581
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,240
kind what we're the uh the kind of

582
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:27,158
strategy that we're going to have to

583
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,759
approach and of course when we add

584
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:31,559
manures or compost on the upper right we

585
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,158
kind of short circuit the plant it had

586
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:37,079
been done elsewhere uh but then we can

587
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,159
uh directly affect the this carbon

588
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,519
cellulose starch uh whatever you want to

589
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:45,200
call this this complex uh material that

590
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,839
are that microbes are going to act

591
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,840
on okay the here we go again with the

592
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,839
soil food web on the right I'm showing

593
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,839
some uh fungi colonizing this plant

594
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:58,558
rizosphere in a more undisturbed

595
00:26:54,839 --> 00:27:00,038
environment um just wanteded to uh use

596
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,079
this slide to kind of introduce this

597
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:05,200
idea again of we've got uh living and

598
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:07,720
dying soil organisms so there's a

599
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,600
there's really a web of life um going on

600
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,960
it uh quite rapidly in our soil that

601
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:14,879
we're going to want to affect with our

602
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,200
management but first i'm going to take

603
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,880
just a few minutes to kind of say how

604
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,000
we're going to look at the processes

605
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,559
themselves in the soil so that we can

606
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,278
apply management to those

607
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:29,158
processes so these right as these uh

608
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,599
organisms cycle they're basically

609
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,159
breaking down organic debris and

610
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:33,158
modifying

611
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:37,918
it and then one by one I want to step

612
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,080
through these other ideas um in this

613
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,278
Cornell soil Health test we we're going

614
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,759
to look at how these organisms create

615
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:46,720
and release glues and and try to try to

616
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:50,119
measure that and quantify it on the

617
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,159
right I show a um a clump of sad dug up

618
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:54,798
and you can see the the nice soil

619
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,360
structure the nice crumb structure uh

620
00:27:54,798 --> 00:28:00,158
these uh soil particles are glued

621
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,678
together not only by uh The Roots

622
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,080
themselves of the plants and the what

623
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,840
we're talking about these exudates from

624
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:08,158
The Roots but also the organisms the

625
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,398
rapid turnover of organisms uh in that

626
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,799
zone helping to glue these these

627
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,639
particles

628
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:17,398
together uh another thing to consider

629
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,440
when we when we grow a if we call this a

630
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:21,918
cover crop or grow a crop we're actually

631
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,360
inserting organic matter into the ground

632
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,480
when this plant dies uh right where

633
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:30,079
right where you see the roots now as

634
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,919
opposed to tillage where we would um

635
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,720
kind of or tillage of let's say a

636
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,440
compost applied to the surface where we

637
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,440
um accomplish something very different

638
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,038
we would mix we would mix the soil from

639
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:46,320
the surface in um very heavy-handedly as

640
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:48,679
opposed to Growing it in uh in place so

641
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,519
that's going to obviously affect our our

642
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,600
net result and this is something we have

643
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:55,480
to keep in mind as we go forward with

644
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:58,599
decisions on how we want to affect our

645
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:02,038
soil and at the bottom right here I show

646
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:04,599
um just a kind of a contrast in uh what

647
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:07,158
soil looks like uh when we test it under

648
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:10,119
the uh the soil Health test on the left

649
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:13,600
that that soil tested uh right in the

650
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:15,000
medium to medium low range instability

651
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,519
and the same soil under different

652
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,359
management uh of no tillage um we see

653
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:22,480
that the soil is holding these Crumbs

654
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,639
are holding up better uh to the action

655
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,640
of the

656
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,000
raindrops right so so these soil

657
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:34,038
organisms in the soil uh can mineralize

658
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,159
nutrients by breaking down

659
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:40,640
mineralization refers to taking organic

660
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:43,200
material and and removing the literally

661
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,640
the nutrients and minerals in it uh back

662
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,038
into plant available forms plants tend

663
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,120
to take up inorganic substances and

664
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:52,278
combine them into organic forms so here

665
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,038
we want to go the other way and

666
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:56,839
mineralize so that's kind of the uh the

667
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,879
opposite of what a plant does we want to

668
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,038
break that plant down into into um

669
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,278
ideally nutrients for our plants and

670
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:05,879
we're going to look at that we look at

671
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:08,759
this with the um potentially mineralized

672
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,880
o nitrogen test in the soil Health test

673
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:13,278
uh we look at the rate of uh of

674
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,760
breakdown of organic materials to

675
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,759
release

676
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,640
ammonium we mentioned before that these

677
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,880
soil organisms can uh protect or infect

678
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,679
crop plants based on what organisms are

679
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,080
there and how we manage for or against

680
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:36,880
them we can use that to our advantage um

681
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,398
to protect our our Target

682
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,640
plant and again this is the we saw this

683
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:45,199
last week this is the soil bioessay um

684
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,919
test that we use in the soil Health test

685
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,480
um this is actually a um Greenhouse test

686
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:54,480
where we plant um you see replicate

687
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,639
samples here in the on the upper left U

688
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,519
of U of A samp of a soil sample where we

689
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:01,879
put it one of these um green beans into

690
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,519
each tube and grown it out in the

691
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,360
greenhouse this is a this variety of

692
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,278
green bean is called high style and it's

693
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,439
well known to researchers particularly

694
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:14,038
uh in Plant Pathology uh because it's

695
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,880
sensitive to a wide variety of of

696
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:19,038
diseases a lot of Growers or Growers

697
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,960
typically don't buy this variety anymore

698
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,919
because it is so sensitive but we can

699
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,600
use that to our advantage uh to kind of

700
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:26,919
see what's in the soil and how our

701
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:29,918
management has affected these uh some of

702
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:32,840
these um list Aral players like pythium

703
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,840
and fusarium in

704
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,759
particular and then another test in the

705
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,720
Cornell soil health health test we

706
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,879
talked about last week was this active

707
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,399
carbon and here's where we're looking at

708
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:50,000
the uh the food value if you will or the

709
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:54,959
energy literally the energy value of the

710
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,038
carbon in our soil um this is the um

711
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,840
what I would call the kindling of the so

712
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:02,879
organic matter this is the easily

713
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:06,638
accessible um easily oxidizable easily

714
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,360
available uh the sugars the uh the

715
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:12,038
cupcakes of the soil organic matter um

716
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:14,959
this is uh bacteria would um act very

717
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:17,038
quickly on this sort of material but a

718
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,440
we can measure this and say a high level

719
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,200
of this would then suggest a high level

720
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,240
of uh activity in our soil so we can use

721
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,399
this information toward as we approach

722
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,679
our

723
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:29,638
management and we talked last week it's

724
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,919
um mention it again we talked last week

725
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:35,959
on about how this purple potassium

726
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,038
permanganate also can break down not not

727
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,038
unlike the organisms can break down and

728
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:44,398
burn this uh soil organic matter and so

729
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:45,960
the more purple that's used up in the

730
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,119
course of this test it's a 10-minute

731
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,159
shaking uh the more purple color that's

732
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:54,359
used up the more available organic

733
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,080
matter was in the sample so it's it's

734
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:57,918
kind of a again it's a we're testing

735
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,558
that flare up we're looking for that

736
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,200
that kindling potential of the of the

737
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,798
soil organic

738
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,200
matter right and here's the uh slide

739
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:09,278
that we talked about a little bit last

740
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,919
week about the uh uh these long-term

741
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,599
humic materials and how important they

742
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,759
are and literally these are the those

743
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,079
presistent

744
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,919
compounds that we really talk about when

745
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:21,398
we say about building soil organic

746
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,720
matter uh the other material it's just a

747
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:25,918
matter of time this this fresh material

748
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,519
won't be fresh for long it's always on

749
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,679
its way to being uh converted into

750
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,638
something else as as organisms uh

751
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,759
transform it but these compounds are

752
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:35,240
kind of the end of the line uh these are

753
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,798
the ones that as I say when we're

754
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,679
building uh are sequestering carbon over

755
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:43,119
time these are the ones we're concerned

756
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:46,200
with uh or that we're talking about and

757
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:48,079
that I had said uh we see um more likely

758
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,960
to develop in these permaculture

759
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:53,720
environments not just because of the um

760
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,519
the action of this a little more fungal

761
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,960
domination but also because of the lack

762
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,960
of stirring and why these are so

763
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,319
important directly is that these these

764
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,240
humic substance really loose in the soil

765
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,598
uh they're very uh light and spongy they

766
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:11,320
hold a lot of water um they soften clay

767
00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:14,159
soils um and they also hold um chemical

768
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,519
nutrients based on their charge they

769
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,519
negative

770
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,960
charge

771
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,720
oops sorry I went the wrong way on that

772
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,720
one

773
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,800
slide Mel function sorry about that here

774
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,800
we go so back to our uh the slide we saw

775
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,440
before where we add organic matter again

776
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,760
these red boxes are all the different uh

777
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,000
tests in the analyses in the cornal soil

778
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,320
Health test looking at these different

779
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,679
uh soil

780
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,399
processes but again I have to stress

781
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,200
when we think of we want to we want to

782
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,118
understand all this but now we want to

783
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,399
talk about okay different organic

784
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,200
matters organic matter sources and uh

785
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,440
qualities are going to affect these

786
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:08,919
differentially so it takes we have to

787
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,280
use the same sort of thinking and and um

788
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:15,680
logic if you will on how these how these

789
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,839
processes are affected um through the

790
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:21,279
through their interaction of the

791
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:23,719
different um Realms of um of their

792
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,160
actual qualities now how could we use

793
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:28,319
that to our advantage and to what we

794
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,799
want out of the um

795
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,119
the the soil that we're working

796
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,359
with going to mention this is the

797
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,160
Cornell soil Health test uh Suite of

798
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,759
measured indicators on the left and on

799
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,920
the right are the soil processes that

800
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,920
we're

801
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,560
measuring here it is the soil Health

802
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,880
Report again the the indicators the

803
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:54,639
value uh where the blue arrow is so

804
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:58,240
these are the um the lab or field return

805
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,559
values we rate remember we rate the

806
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:03,239
um these

807
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:06,639
values with our database the lower 30%

808
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:09,239
of scores uh in the database are scored

809
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,920
red uh and that's useful for uh

810
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:14,318
developing what we call constraints on

811
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,159
the far right so if uh uh if a value

812
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:19,358
comes back in the lower 30% for the soil

813
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:21,358
texture for its soil texture then we

814
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:24,239
would say yes this uh these these

815
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:27,159
functions are are U below certainly

816
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,358
below an Optimum or room for improvement

817
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:31,279
and so the is where we kind of start to

818
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:34,119
put together these uh these different

819
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,040
processes in the soil that we can then

820
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:38,838
approach with our management to kind of

821
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:40,400
get at uh several of these at once as I

822
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:43,559
said before create these these

823
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,960
synergistic opportunities for um for

824
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,119
knocking out multiple uh multiple issues

825
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,119
at

826
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:01,440
once and I have to mention the uh

827
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:05,079
the website here a lot of this material

828
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,159
that we talk about is on our website um

829
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:10,880
in the training manual very useful

830
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:13,039
document um available as uh a free

831
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,880
download from the website also there's

832
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,759
all sorts of information on sampling um

833
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,599
delivery of samples to our lab just

834
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,079
strategies in general um and in the

835
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,960
manual not only does it talk about part

836
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:27,680
one the soil test itself but what we're

837
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,800
going to move into now this the soil

838
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,039
management guidelines so kind of a

839
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,400
starting place for using the information

840
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:34,400
to go

841
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,760
forward right so last week really we

842
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:43,279
talked about uh the soil processes and

843
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,119
the soil Health test indicators at the

844
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,280
bottom we spent a lot of time on that I

845
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,318
introduced this this idea that we can

846
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,119
use this um use this information in the

847
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:55,559
test report then towards uh our soil

848
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,559
management but again to use this

849
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:59,759
holistic strategy we have to understand

850
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:02,440
in the processes find out which

851
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,520
processes are impaired then tweak our

852
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,519
management to address

853
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:17,358
them coming back to our um soil Health

854
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,040
Report from before so this is a um a RI

855
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:22,799
this was a a strawberry field that had

856
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:25,800
excuse me Ry vet on it for two years um

857
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,280
3 years ago and then strawberries were

858
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,720
planted and grown for 2 years it's a

859
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,200
Sandy LOM

860
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:35,039
soil so the first thing we're going to

861
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:39,199
want to do uh to use this holistic

862
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:41,440
strategy is to um test the soil and get

863
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:44,759
the information on what functions in the

864
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,760
soil are good bad and indiff and from

865
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,720
this then we can learn a lot for example

866
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,920
we look at the aggregate stability the

867
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:53,159
first physical indicator we see that it

868
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,440
comes back at a 95% rating it's in the

869
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:58,639
green so we've got a really nice soil

870
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,039
structure according to the test yet as

871
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,759
we move down down the list we see that

872
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,759
there's surface hardness and subsurface

873
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,560
hardness so we've got some compaction in

874
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,599
the

875
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,000
soil which we'll want to take into

876
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,119
account as we move forward and down in

877
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,400
the biological realm we see we've got a

878
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,440
dis a decent amount of total organic

879
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,920
matter 2.8% for a Sandy lone that's not

880
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:24,800
bad but our active carbon our our fresh

881
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:28,880
organic material and our um the the rate

882
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,760
of um mineralization nitrogen so this

883
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,160
this breakdown of of organic material

884
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,119
into available nutrients and and fresh

885
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,598
material uh that that rate is also

886
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,039
slow looks like our soil chemistry is

887
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,559
pretty good our

888
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:44,800
pH kind of kind of at the bottom end of

889
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:48,279
of where we'd want

890
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,680
it but pnk look good micronutrients look

891
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:54,400
good too we've got an overall score soil

892
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:57,719
Health score of 59 call that 60 uh in

893
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,880
the medium range kind of useful for just

894
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:01,598
kind of thinking in the long term uh

895
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,680
several years later we we we'll try

896
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,559
we'll try some uh different Management

897
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,759
on this field and several years later

898
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:10,078
we'll sample again and see how we've uh

899
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,920
affected

900
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,079
things so we've talked about the first

901
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,880
step step two what might we do our

902
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,599
management options uh this is kind of a

903
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,160
brainstorming um strategy here where we

904
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,039
kind of say well it's certainly we'd

905
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:28,519
want to identify this hard layer find

906
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:30,719
out just what's causing it um where it

907
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:33,239
is exactly what are we going to do about

908
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,318
it what might we do about it I list here

909
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:37,719
that we might we might plow it up we

910
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:39,119
might uh maybe use a deep Ripper we

911
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:43,279
might go with a cover

912
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:45,039
crop um then to address the soil biology

913
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,839
while we're thinking about plowing and

914
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,159
ripping and and perhaps growing a cover

915
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:51,519
crap we want to maybe feed the soil with

916
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:53,440
some heavy debris if we could get some

917
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:57,440
if that's possible that debris could

918
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,920
feed the soil um particularly if it's um

919
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,720
got rich uh biological material that

920
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,119
would start to spin our soil food web

921
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:07,358
and perhaps address our active

922
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:10,000
carbon um if we use a nitrogen-rich

923
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:12,759
material again this is a as a compost as

924
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,960
we feed the soil directly um if we had

925
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,400
something that had uh nitrogen first

926
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,280
Fair supply of nitrogen in the organic

927
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,760
form that would help build our

928
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:26,240
population of mineralizable uh nitrogen

929
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,079
uh Critters uh and increase that uh that

930
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:30,639
rate

931
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,560
we may in our cover crop we would want

932
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:35,838
probably a rich root residual like we

933
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:38,519
saw in the sad photo a few slides ago

934
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:41,239
where we can maybe without even plowing

935
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:43,838
we could move this Rich organic material

936
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:46,399
maybe maybe even rich with or with

937
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:49,159
nitrogen right into the soil profile

938
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,000
without plowing or bringing anything in

939
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:54,679
and that would be for example growing a

940
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,280
a clover or a vetch or an elf

941
00:41:54,679 --> 00:42:00,919
Alpha you may want to mix uh the disease

942
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,640
rating here looks pretty good however

943
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,280
there uh I mentioned these options with

944
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:08,358
these new crucifers um a lot of

945
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,640
different uh options out there for um

946
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:13,598
crops to use as cover crops and uh and

947
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:15,239
nurse crops to to build the soil but but

948
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,920
again we want to we want to have that in

949
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:20,159
mind uh just because this test tells us

950
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,079
we're in good shape with uh with root

951
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,799
health doesn't mean we might not want to

952
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:27,839
um get something mixed into our our

953
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,519
rotation here that provides

954
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,279
uh some suppressive capacity towards

955
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:35,039
something we know that's out there or

956
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,280
have heard about in in the vicinity so

957
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,759
then we're going to move to step three

958
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,760
and step

959
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,960
four uh but before we do uh we want to

960
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,119
think about uh what we're trying to do

961
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,639
with soil management um it's it's an

962
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:53,280
Ever more complex world there's so much

963
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,838
information out there that we have to

964
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,960
continue learning uh modifying what we

965
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,920
know asking questions

966
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,720
uh seeing what people are doing all over

967
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,159
the world really uh certainly in our

968
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:07,239
region um to learn of these latest

969
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:10,039
Technologies strategies um so that we

970
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:12,759
can be better not just better Growers

971
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:14,759
but as consultants and Educators better

972
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,160
uh suppliers of information uh and

973
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,319
sharing this information so that we as

974
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:22,639
as a group uh can just all be more

975
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:27,480
successful and of course as

976
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:30,000
we try to capture new markets or um work

977
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,719
with new varieties new cover crops that

978
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,679
requires us to um really I use the word

979
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:38,759
transition to be capable of applying

980
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:41,358
this new knowledge then incrementally

981
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:44,720
into our own minds first then into our

982
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:47,279
management where we kind of realize that

983
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:49,399
we the things we haven't been doing uh

984
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,559
might behoove us to to learn and to

985
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,400
learn how to do uh never easy with uh

986
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,319
agriculture as you know there's a lot of

987
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,920
risk associated with it and so we're we

988
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:01,838
tend to want to be risk averse and these

989
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,760
changes are risk um because because

990
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,960
there's a learning curve so that's where

991
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,240
the uh the Consulting egg professionals

992
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,440
and the grower uh we'll see more and

993
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:14,519
more of these um uh Liaisons being

994
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,159
necessary yet uh at the same time that

995
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:19,838
we're going to see probably less and

996
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:23,399
less money for um State and County

997
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:25,119
support for this so we we really need to

998
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,599
uh be thinking how can I get this

999
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,079
information out uh as Educators but also

1000
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:33,119
as Growers how can I get this

1001
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,480
information in um from all these from

1002
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,400
all these different

1003
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,000
sources okay and again this information

1004
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,519
all this information is we really have

1005
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,920
to deal in a case by case field by field

1006
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,000
grower by grower basis so even when we

1007
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,480
learn principles and strategies

1008
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,639
somewhere at a conference at at a

1009
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,358
particular Growers field we need to take

1010
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:58,078
from that then the principles and say ah

1011
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:01,199
can I use that principles back in my

1012
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,200
Locale and this it's actually very

1013
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,838
exciting if you're an educator because

1014
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:07,399
you you kind of get to go out into the

1015
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:10,519
world and and learn and then apply that

1016
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,000
learning um really without the risk that

1017
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:15,358
the grower has um but the grower is

1018
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,079
doing the same thing uh going out

1019
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:20,358
learning coming up with new questions uh

1020
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,559
for of things to try and more questions

1021
00:45:20,358 --> 00:45:24,920
for the educator so this all this

1022
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,240
information going back and forth it

1023
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:30,000
really requires considerable attention

1024
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:32,838
and thought and really if you will

1025
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,679
creativity um to be useful because

1026
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:39,799
things are changing and that change just

1027
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:44,440
requires this kind of a uh a a

1028
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:48,318
deliberate process of of of adapting to

1029
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:50,960
it right so in our soil Health manual um

1030
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:53,000
we've got table five here on page 57 if

1031
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,679
everyone anyone has the manual um they

1032
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,639
kind of lists shortterm and long-term

1033
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,558
management strategies to deal with um

1034
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:03,400
for

1035
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:06,880
example limitations identified by the in

1036
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:09,639
the soil Health Report but uh I have to

1037
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,119
mention these are just starting points

1038
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:13,799
but they do kind of get at this this

1039
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:17,000
idea that we have a we have a

1040
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,480
generalized model that we start from so

1041
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,039
there's no I don't want to say there's

1042
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,880
no answers here but there's no

1043
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:24,159
recommendations here it's it's

1044
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,960
information that we again apply into our

1045
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:29,358
model and go forward with more specifics

1046
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,960
that are germine to us but use this just

1047
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:35,480
as a more of a reference uh starting

1048
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:39,800
place so uh I'd like to use this the

1049
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:42,280
first uh circled um uh physical concern

1050
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,839
there this low aggregate stability the

1051
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,000
um like to talk in the short term how a

1052
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:50,119
manager might address that if that was

1053
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
the case uh we we note here that it's we

1054
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:54,200
talk about fresh organic materials

1055
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,119
shallow rooted cover crops we saw the

1056
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:59,960
the picture of that grass sad um um some

1057
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:03,160
slides ago showing that how we could

1058
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,199
build soil structure with that um of

1059
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:07,039
course a rotation crop as well could can

1060
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:09,838
provide that when we add fresh manure

1061
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:11,838
and or green clippings um to the surface

1062
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:14,039
of the soil of course we're uh these

1063
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:15,799
these materials will be rapidly attacked

1064
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:18,719
there's a lot of fresh carbon there a

1065
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,318
lot of sugar so to speak for the soil

1066
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,439
bacteria uh so rapid order they're going

1067
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:27,239
to turn turn over spin that soil food

1068
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,240
web help glue our soil back together in

1069
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:31,078
the longer term again we're going to

1070
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:33,479
want to be thinking about well how did I

1071
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:35,519
get into this uh position in the first

1072
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,000
place uh it may be that we want to look

1073
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,440
at uh a lot of interest these days in

1074
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,039
reducing tillage not not necessarily

1075
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,720
going to what we call no till uh but

1076
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:47,000
there's a new term out there called Low

1077
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:49,639
till where we just simply try to reduce

1078
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,880
the tillage intensity and frequency uh

1079
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:53,879
look for opportunities to really think

1080
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,960
can we focus the tillage right in a Zone

1081
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,280
rather than across the whole soil

1082
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,440
surface for example

1083
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,800
we might want to think about a surface

1084
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,400
mulch certainly in a um in a berry

1085
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,680
situation we're often dealing with

1086
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:09,519
surface mulches that can protect the

1087
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:12,440
soil and provide a constant Source um of

1088
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,800
material that we can kind of maybe dis

1089
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,880
in or or uh stir in a little bit once in

1090
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:21,200
a while uh to keep our um our soil

1091
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:24,119
bacteria cycling and protecting that

1092
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,118
soil uh

1093
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,680
structure

1094
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:34,279
okay so in a again in a broad sense when

1095
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:36,879
we um talk about the soil Health Report

1096
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,800
strategy uh gone over this several times

1097
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,000
and I do apologize but I I think it's

1098
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,480
important to to keep mentioning this

1099
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,119
we're going to identify uh areas in the

1100
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,119
soil uh that need uh attention because

1101
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:52,519
they have we're determining that the

1102
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:54,720
processes are are are

1103
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:57,239
constrained so now we want to combine

1104
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:59,879
this information with the Growers needs

1105
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:03,318
skills and available resources to come

1106
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,880
up with a strategy to deal with them and

1107
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:09,480
I mentioned here the the four really our

1108
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:11,400
four broad sense options in management

1109
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:14,838
there anything we might do to the soil

1110
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:17,440
really pretty much falls into one or a

1111
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:21,078
combination of these groups so we can

1112
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,760
change the U the crop that we grow uh

1113
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:25,839
and what that leaves behind how that

1114
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:28,119
that organic matter uh affects the soil

1115
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:30,838
uh also the the the uh production

1116
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:34,920
strategy how we manage the soil to grow

1117
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:40,318
that crop affects the soil uh by again

1118
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:42,280
of changing um varieties or um to longer

1119
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:45,480
season shorter seasons for example we

1120
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,960
can open windows for cover crops to be

1121
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,400
inserted into these

1122
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,960
windows so hybrid Choice becoming very

1123
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,920
important in cop rotation a lot of uh

1124
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,079
lot of documentation of what these

1125
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,200
different hybrids can do uh to provide

1126
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:02,359
uh as we mentioned before um certain

1127
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:05,679
chemicals in the plant that um that we

1128
00:50:02,358 --> 00:50:08,639
might want um as a if you will as a

1129
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:10,759
byproduct uh to affect our soil soil

1130
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:13,039
environment and of course cover crops

1131
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,920
themselves what a uh what an easiest

1132
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:17,719
thing to say you know we need to grow a

1133
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,400
cover crop but that that only that only

1134
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:22,439
puts the book on the table it still

1135
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,599
needs to be opened and red um and this

1136
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:27,159
is where it's uh it's a Brave New World

1137
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:29,920
a lot of information out there um we

1138
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:31,879
just need to really be on top of what

1139
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,000
all these options are we'll go through

1140
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,200
that in a moment organic and chemical

1141
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,239
amendments we when we manage the soil

1142
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:41,239
certainly I mentioned a couple times we

1143
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:43,199
can bring material from other places in

1144
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:45,919
and apply it to our soil surface either

1145
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:49,000
as organic or chemical um and work that

1146
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,760
in or or leave it there and of course we

1147
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,639
typically work it in uh with tillage and

1148
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:58,040
soil stirring and so we always have

1149
00:50:53,639 --> 00:51:00,798
options to uh manage the soil that way

1150
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:03,039
so we'll go through those one by

1151
00:51:00,798 --> 00:51:06,039
one um the crop

1152
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:09,838
rotation suppressing disease smothering

1153
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:14,480
weeds all these uh again kind of broad

1154
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:18,599
sense caveats of um really an agronomic

1155
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:21,639
approach um the when we rotate crops we

1156
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:24,798
can again put different material there

1157
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:27,239
or not there at different times uh to

1158
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:29,440
affect our soil biology different cover

1159
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:31,679
crops same idea but there's different

1160
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,639
windows for for different cover crops

1161
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:34,318
and again they're going to have

1162
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,440
different qualities the different cover

1163
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:37,960
crops not only when they're because

1164
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,798
because of when they're grown but what

1165
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:43,280
they bring what they bring to our um the

1166
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:45,759
organic table the

1167
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,480
pallet organic and chemical amendments

1168
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,799
my gosh uh manure and compost so easy to

1169
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,880
list them but the diversity of manure

1170
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:57,358
and compost and green manures how we

1171
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,280
might uh use these um in these it's it's

1172
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,358
very easy to list these but there's a

1173
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,240
lot of information behind each of these

1174
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:05,798
that we'll discuss in a moment but we

1175
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:09,719
have to be aware that it's going to take

1176
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:12,639
uh creative thought and movement into um

1177
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:14,798
uh the the Page Beyond this page uh to

1178
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:18,159
make our best decisions and of course I

1179
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:21,440
mentioned crop residues themselves U

1180
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:23,798
biochar um then more conventional

1181
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,639
fertilizers pesticides herbicides that

1182
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:28,639
we can also add to the soil to manage it

1183
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,118
and of course tillage this I mentioned

1184
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:32,838
the low till and no till tillage can

1185
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,119
break up or prevent

1186
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:38,880
competion and there's lots of new

1187
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:41,280
equipment out there um that allows us uh

1188
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,119
I call it Innovations in disturbance

1189
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,839
different ways we can stir the soil um

1190
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,960
different shapes of shank everything

1191
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:52,199
from different shapes of Shanks couters

1192
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,199
Etc um that can be very useful for

1193
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,440
us

1194
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,920
okay um I show here on the right um crop

1195
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:07,240
rotation on Organic Farms that's a uh

1196
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:11,119
fairly recent publication available

1197
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:13,959
through the the s website s.org uh for a

1198
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:16,720
very low price also available free as an

1199
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:19,639
online download uh this looks like it's

1200
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:21,000
for organic farms and it is uh but

1201
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:23,000
that's not to say that there's not

1202
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,798
principles in here that are useful for

1203
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,519
any grower uh you know as you know

1204
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:32,519
organic grower must be very cognizant of

1205
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:35,759
crop rotations uh to protect their or to

1206
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:37,960
right affect their soil uh biological

1207
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,400
populations because they don't have the

1208
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:43,280
literally the luxury of coming in with a

1209
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,599
with a very specific chemical that that

1210
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,440
has very specific chemicals that have

1211
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:51,838
been developed for us by chemical

1212
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:55,400
companies to to kill or or uh manage

1213
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:58,078
very specific pests so uh the uh the

1214
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,838
organic perspec perspective here is very

1215
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,079
useful um towards as we strategize

1216
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:06,880
towards uh understanding of how we can

1217
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:09,519
affect our our soil biology right so the

1218
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:13,440
again the different crops uh suppress or

1219
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:16,000
break disease Cycles uh there's uh by

1220
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,318
growing crops that take more or less

1221
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,599
time uh we open up

1222
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:23,279
Windows where can grow a cover crop for

1223
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:26,798
example to some other weeds uh ideal

1224
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:30,280
crop rotations uh best U utilized our

1225
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:33,318
Our Land equipment and labor resources

1226
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:35,480
allow us to grow crops that um people

1227
00:54:33,318 --> 00:54:38,480
are are clamoring for and paying money

1228
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:41,318
for and of course rotation was sad I had

1229
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:44,039
to mention this um in a cop when we talk

1230
00:54:41,318 --> 00:54:47,318
about crop rotation um it's important to

1231
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:49,199
consider um taking a field not out of

1232
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:51,318
production but putting a or part of a

1233
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:55,399
field into sad uh for all the wonderful

1234
00:54:51,318 --> 00:54:58,079
things it can do um to rebuild the soil

1235
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,119
very dramatically

1236
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,400
drastically wanted to talk a little bit

1237
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:04,720
about cover crops again wonderful book

1238
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,720
out there U managing cover crops

1239
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:10,039
profitably uh available for free uh to

1240
00:55:07,719 --> 00:55:14,759
download at the website below or very

1241
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:19,480
low cost um and this gets at um The Cult

1242
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:22,359
the culture and aspect and um um

1243
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:24,400
qualities of a whole Suite of cover

1244
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:26,759
crops uh for the whole certainly for the

1245
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:29,079
whole Northeast uh in this this book

1246
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,160
actually goes uh further south and a bit

1247
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:33,240
into the into the western state in the

1248
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:37,000
Midwestern states talking about all the

1249
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:41,000
different um effects in culture of of

1250
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,719
cover crops but again

1251
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,639
different cover crops will have

1252
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:50,279
different

1253
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:52,519
qualities more or less of of them of

1254
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,599
some of these listed uh features here so

1255
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:58,440
if we had a if we had an issue of that

1256
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:01,280
we wanted to for example add

1257
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,519
nitrogen with a cover crop obviously

1258
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:07,000
there's we want to choose in the legume

1259
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:09,318
family but um the idea here is we want

1260
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,159
to we want to be really be wise and

1261
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:15,279
clever um and choose well um but there's

1262
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:18,038
a lot to learn we can't it this isn't

1263
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:20,160
just an offthe cuff decision um I'm

1264
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:23,079
going to plant a cover crop and now I'm

1265
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:25,399
done until I plant it no that as I say

1266
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:27,720
that that book needs to be opened and uh

1267
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,880
takes a lot of discussion a lot of

1268
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:32,318
research uh a lot of questions to be

1269
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,039
asked and answered uh by the grower and

1270
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:36,838
the any sort of

1271
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:39,680
consultant so that we can maybe even

1272
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:41,880
with a with with our cover crop not only

1273
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,719
address some of the things we see here

1274
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:47,519
um but do more than that simultaneously

1275
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:51,719
and again some cover crops do several of

1276
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:53,920
these um singularly circled um factors

1277
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:53,919
at

1278
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:00,079
once all right there's even a uh online

1279
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:01,598
cover crop decision tool I've got the

1280
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:04,359
website down at the bottom this was

1281
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:07,440
developed by Thomas borkman um a cornal

1282
00:57:04,358 --> 00:57:10,199
researcher up at Geneva uh where you can

1283
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,200
uh actually type in a a management goal

1284
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:16,358
so what is he says the reason you need a

1285
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:18,480
cover crop so from that last slide if we

1286
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:21,159
wanted to enhance one of those

1287
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,000
particular features if are if we're

1288
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:28,598
really looking to

1289
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,798
um uh affect um one particular aspect of

1290
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:34,160
our soil uh very powerfully we could

1291
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:36,639
type that in here and then the the crop

1292
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:39,199
the decision tool would also ask us well

1293
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:43,000
when is your window how and how long is

1294
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:46,279
it open um and and then it would um give

1295
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,480
you different uh options uh of cover

1296
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:51,880
crops that fit uh fit that need but

1297
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,838
again uh I'm going to go over all four

1298
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:58,000
of these bullets here note that each

1299
00:57:53,838 --> 00:58:00,159
option tested in strategy is always an

1300
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,358
iteration towards a final decision I had

1301
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:04,838
to read that it's this idea that uh we

1302
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:07,639
need to kind of go through it in our

1303
00:58:04,838 --> 00:58:10,199
mind and say does this work or how well

1304
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:13,078
does it work because we can always

1305
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:15,279
modify that a little bit towards what we

1306
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:19,798
need and that that we have to keep that

1307
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:22,359
in mind uh lot lots of um Success

1308
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:24,400
Through sharing success stories uh when

1309
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:27,239
we see a grower with a particular

1310
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:31,358
situation in an area that kind of uh

1311
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:34,318
comes up with a cover crop uh crop

1312
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:36,199
combination uh that has luck with that

1313
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:38,199
um we hear about it at a field day for

1314
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:41,318
example or we see something we can think

1315
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:44,439
ah now how can I modify that or use that

1316
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:46,759
for myself as a starting point very

1317
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:49,240
we've seen a lot of great um we heard a

1318
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:52,799
lot of great success stories built out

1319
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:55,000
of success stories um Growers often

1320
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:57,159
start small and we recommend this uh

1321
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,719
using strip trials or you know half of a

1322
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:01,639
field managed one way or another way to

1323
00:58:59,719 --> 00:59:04,399
kind of learn on their Farm what works

1324
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:07,480
or or what they uh find just doesn't

1325
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,838
won't work for them also as we enter

1326
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:12,559
into new worlds of cover crops and

1327
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:15,440
different rotations uh we can also

1328
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,039
introduce new pests and problems uh that

1329
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,280
we didn't have before because we weren't

1330
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:22,640
using these strategies so again we have

1331
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:28,039
to be uh Vigilant and uh ready to learn

1332
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:28,038
whatever is necessary um to move forward

1333
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:31,279
right now I want to talk a little bit

1334
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:34,359
more about this managing of organic

1335
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,720
matter um again I put uh a book by

1336
00:59:34,358 --> 00:59:38,279
Harold vaness and uh Fred magdoff in the

1337
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:41,480
upper left corner this building soil for

1338
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,960
better crops um available free online

1339
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,679
very low cost if you want to own the

1340
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,400
book

1341
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:50,118
itself and uh what this book talks about

1342
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,680
at Great in great length is how to

1343
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:54,798
balance this idea of we want to

1344
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:57,000
decompose organic matter to release

1345
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:58,599
nutrients we want want the organic

1346
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,239
matter to break down to as I've

1347
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:02,440
mentioned before glue our Aggregates

1348
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:04,959
together we want to feed the important

1349
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,760
soil biology but at the same time we

1350
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,199
also want organic matter to

1351
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,720
accumulate for all the important reasons

1352
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:14,199
that we want organic matter in our soil

1353
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:18,480
to to store water to retain nutrients uh

1354
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:21,439
to loosen the soil um carbon storage so

1355
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:24,159
the really the only way to uh to be

1356
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,798
successful at this is to literally keep

1357
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:29,399
adding organic matter because we uh as

1358
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:31,559
we decompose it we we have less and we

1359
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,960
can only accumulate it by growing or

1360
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:37,200
adding more so we we need to kind of tip

1361
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:41,358
this scale the other way so we're kind

1362
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:43,399
of accumulating on a on a net basis or

1363
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:45,440
should say a gross bases even though at

1364
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,798
times we need to decompose some of that

1365
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,599
organic

1366
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:52,759
matter so again it it we're going to

1367
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:55,680
have to um feed the soil with uh

1368
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:58,280
different materials and regularly and

1369
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:03,038
the more diverse organic matter we can

1370
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:06,839
add the more the broader a base of U

1371
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,839
organic activity we have in the

1372
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,599
field and again I mentioned compost

1373
01:01:09,318 --> 01:01:14,960
cover crops these crop revenues adding

1374
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:16,400
leaves biochair when we when we add

1375
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,159
these different materials or grow these

1376
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,400
different materials remember that we're

1377
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:24,679
going to uh

1378
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:27,119
accumulate a different kind then of um

1379
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:29,440
soil food web res response to this

1380
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:33,039
different food source and that's really

1381
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,039
what ultimately what we're managing

1382
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:37,118
for here's that slide all organic matter

1383
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:39,598
is not created equal I've talked about

1384
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,599
this any number of times now but if we

1385
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:44,318
look at this pyramid when we add a a

1386
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,318
green matter or green manure as a cover

1387
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:48,759
crop we're adding these sugars these

1388
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:51,358
these lighter less complex compounds

1389
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,960
that the U bacteria are very hungry for

1390
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:55,239
when we had composts or when we're

1391
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,159
dealing with composts we've moved

1392
01:01:55,239 --> 01:02:00,598
further down the pyramid already in the

1393
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:04,038
compost pile into these more uh complex

1394
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:06,359
longer lasting um

1395
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:08,640
materials and again the different types

1396
01:02:06,358 --> 01:02:11,119
of organic matter are going to affect

1397
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:13,239
the bullets you see etherite some of

1398
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:16,000
them will affect soil aggregation

1399
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:17,239
particularly um the green matter but

1400
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,880
different green matter will have

1401
01:02:17,239 --> 01:02:21,838
different effect um on the soil itself

1402
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:24,160
we've all heard of for example buckwheat

1403
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:27,519
having a particularly profound effect on

1404
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:29,480
soil aggregation under very short time

1405
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:31,400
uh so we again we need to keep that in

1406
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:33,318
mind it's they're easy again easy to

1407
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:36,838
list as bullet points but we need to

1408
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:39,880
think about what exactly will do that uh

1409
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:39,880
to be to affect our

1410
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:47,480
management right and also uh this is

1411
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:50,038
also um something we see in uh Herold

1412
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:52,480
Vanessa's in book more is not always

1413
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:54,440
better so we have to be careful

1414
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,639
particularly when we apply uh compost

1415
01:02:54,440 --> 01:03:01,200
and manure on the surface of the soil um

1416
01:02:57,639 --> 01:03:03,920
it's very easy to a to to over apply um

1417
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:05,798
and cause leeching and denitrification

1418
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,079
concerns

1419
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:14,079
um in vegetables in particular we don't

1420
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:16,798
want uh too much fgure um from uh too

1421
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:19,318
high supply of nitrogen or or other

1422
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:22,159
compounds or other nutrients in the soil

1423
01:03:19,318 --> 01:03:25,199
U also uh over application of compost

1424
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:28,199
might keep the soil too wet um all

1425
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:30,118
important considerations to uh always

1426
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:33,919
work within if I can move down to the

1427
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:36,200
last bullet point uh to kind of start uh

1428
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,278
start from an an what I'm I'm calling an

1429
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:40,598
industry standard we don't want to go

1430
01:03:38,278 --> 01:03:43,159
overboard with these application

1431
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:46,920
strategies um we want to kind of start

1432
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:49,480
from a um a safe place and then modify

1433
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:52,639
from there as our crops and our field

1434
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:56,079
and our our material

1435
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:58,278
requires and keeping in mind also that

1436
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:04,240
uh particular I give this wine example

1437
01:03:58,278 --> 01:04:06,798
here um how some crops and or grapes

1438
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:08,558
grown for wine actually we don't want

1439
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:10,000
this great fgure and we want to be

1440
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:12,920
actually be very careful of what we're

1441
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,838
adding um just kind of a if you will an

1442
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:18,240
overe extreme example of um really

1443
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:19,798
thinking ahead towards what we're doing

1444
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:21,959
and make sure that that is indeed what

1445
01:04:19,798 --> 01:04:21,960
we

1446
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:31,440
want oh right back to our stirring of

1447
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:33,000
the soil again to speed up these

1448
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,200
bacteriological

1449
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,440
processes um

1450
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:41,318
the our organic matter is going to

1451
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,318
mineralize faster when we stir

1452
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:47,199
it and the way we do that stirring so

1453
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:49,920
often was with tillage um this is a

1454
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:51,439
slide showing tillage addiction so I'm

1455
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:55,278
going to go from the upper left

1456
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:57,639
clockwise around where we till a soil um

1457
01:04:55,278 --> 01:05:01,480
we see being completely inverted this is

1458
01:04:57,639 --> 01:05:04,199
aad um it's being PL plowed a little wet

1459
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:08,000
uh kind of show the kind of a worst case

1460
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:11,239
scenario here of uh of soil um tillage

1461
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,960
nonetheless we're always uh involved at

1462
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:16,519
kind of some aspect of this so after we

1463
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:19,440
flip the soil over with this till mour

1464
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:21,719
tillage now we've got uh cloudy soil

1465
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,000
that needs to be made into a seed bed or

1466
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:26,919
a planting bed then typically we come

1467
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,119
across the field and Teck it down uh

1468
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:31,639
firm it up but then we're set up for

1469
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:34,640
potential crusting the soil is

1470
01:05:31,639 --> 01:05:38,000
unprotected it's bare uh this is a kind

1471
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:41,239
of a worst case scenario but uh I show

1472
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,559
this to make people realize that or or

1473
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:46,479
not forget I should say um the tillage

1474
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:48,480
is a very powerful uh very powerful tool

1475
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,838
that we shouldn't shouldn't take lightly

1476
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,358
that when we when we apply tillage were

1477
01:05:50,838 --> 01:05:55,679
really really affecting a lot of um a

1478
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:57,920
lot of soil processes not just the

1479
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:01,118
physical things you see here but the

1480
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:03,880
organisms um are going to be literally

1481
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,880
tipped upside down um and they're going

1482
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:08,440
to respond to that in a way that may be

1483
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:10,480
useful to us or um or maybe not so we

1484
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:13,880
want to keep that in

1485
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:16,119
mind we see a lot of focus tillage uh

1486
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:19,400
through this uh this sort of Ripper

1487
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:22,720
strategy uh instead of a the last slide

1488
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:24,358
that was a full uh full width mward plow

1489
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:26,598
just flipping over the entire soil

1490
01:06:24,358 --> 01:06:28,838
surface uh these rippers I think

1491
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:32,480
everyone's seen these uh have a rather

1492
01:06:28,838 --> 01:06:34,920
narrow shank typically an inch wide um

1493
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,798
this is shown setup for row crop

1494
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:40,240
production however the idea is that we

1495
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:42,719
uh Focus the tillage uh really right in

1496
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:44,919
the vicinity of this rip shank uh we

1497
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:48,679
don't flip the entire surface over and

1498
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:51,960
we end up really just um kind of plowing

1499
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:54,358
in a in a in a narrow

1500
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,760
Zone here's kind of what it looks like

1501
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:58,639
then in the upper left uh we've got an

1502
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,680
uh kind of an undisturbed surface for

1503
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:02,598
most of the soil surface but then our

1504
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:04,759
our rip shank can go at a variety of

1505
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:07,798
different depths whatever is necessary

1506
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:10,160
to break uh restricted layers up and

1507
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:12,400
we're left with a if you will a no till

1508
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:15,239
environment between the rips and a

1509
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:18,880
tilled environment where the rips are

1510
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:20,639
very handy in uh approaching a certainly

1511
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,240
a bedded situation where we're we're

1512
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:26,118
almost forced to do this um but you know

1513
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:28,118
keep in mind that by focusing the uh

1514
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:30,519
focusing the disturbance we can kind of

1515
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:32,240
get the best of both worlds and allow us

1516
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:34,400
and this is a of course a field crop

1517
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:36,479
example but we've got then a hybrid

1518
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,440
system where we've plowed where we're

1519
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,798
going to plant the seed and have a small

1520
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:43,200
plant but then as the plant grows and

1521
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:45,400
explores new areas it'll actually be

1522
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:47,118
growing between the rows into a

1523
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:49,798
virtually unplowed or no till

1524
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:52,278
environment so we've got a plow a plow

1525
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:54,880
Zone and an unplowed Zone and so we can

1526
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:57,239
take advantage of of the season if it's

1527
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,599
wet or dry or periods of wet and dry the

1528
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:01,439
plant has areas uh where the root is

1529
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,798
that where the soil will be drier or

1530
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,880
moiser um because of this hybrid uh

1531
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:09,318
scenario so I really like this sort of

1532
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,200
um slide to show you how we when we

1533
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:13,838
change our management a little bit we

1534
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:15,639
look at the bottom center uh picture we

1535
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:17,798
see on the right the conventional if

1536
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:20,238
it's hot and dry our entire soil surface

1537
01:08:17,798 --> 01:08:22,238
is going to dry out for example where

1538
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:24,559
with a restricted wi tillage where we

1539
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:26,559
focus our tillage we get a lot of hot

1540
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,359
dry weather we're going to have a little

1541
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:33,199
bit more uh water storage underneath all

1542
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,199
the debris between those ripped

1543
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:40,319
areas right and I list here some of the

1544
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:42,718
these tips for transitioning that's a

1545
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:46,120
one of my favorite words uh to reduce

1546
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:50,640
tillage Crop Production um the idea is

1547
01:08:46,119 --> 01:08:52,719
is that we're uh trying to transition to

1548
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:55,159
less tillage so we're we're we're

1549
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:57,640
thinking about do I need to do what I've

1550
01:08:55,158 --> 01:08:59,879
always is done is there a new method out

1551
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,759
there or I've heard of this new method

1552
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:05,640
how do I transition uh my field into

1553
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:07,880
using it um and here are some of the uh

1554
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:10,319
some of the ideas so first of all we

1555
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:13,679
soil compaction is a question of soil

1556
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:16,480
being dense uh to allev alleviate that

1557
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:18,520
we want to loosen the soil again this is

1558
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:21,879
uh with with the iron in the field as

1559
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:24,880
opposed to a um using plants to do it

1560
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:26,600
but we can focus AR tillage to to

1561
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,279
specific

1562
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:32,000
zones in particular for example A Wheel

1563
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:34,799
track Zone maybe the only area compacted

1564
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,399
in our field is where a particular piece

1565
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:40,119
of equipment went well it would it might

1566
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:43,639
behoove us to focus directly on that

1567
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:46,119
rather than attempting to loosen or till

1568
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:50,560
till the entire

1569
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:53,920
field um and that's um where we can also

1570
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:56,760
um when we when we put this in concert

1571
01:09:53,920 --> 01:10:01,000
with uh the green text uh I guess number

1572
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:03,400
four we can feed the soil food web with

1573
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,760
our organic material and combine that

1574
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:07,279
with our tillage and say wait this is

1575
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:11,079
this is how we can

1576
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:14,759
accomplish more than one of or a second

1577
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:16,439
and third objective simultaneously um in

1578
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,480
my management

1579
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:22,119
strategy of course then there's longer

1580
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:25,279
and shorter term uh strategies for that

1581
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:27,760
uh with the the cover crops rotations Ed

1582
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:29,679
adding Organics reducing tillage we

1583
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:33,360
listed those in the in the

1584
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:36,079
toolbox um when we can build the soil

1585
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:39,359
and reduce our tillage and and build it

1586
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:41,039
with um rebuild our soil structure the

1587
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:42,319
soil can become more resilient to

1588
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:44,399
weather

1589
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:48,719
extremes and I have to mention at the

1590
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:52,158
bottom that when the soil is in this um

1591
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:55,719
uh if you will healthier condition and

1592
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:58,559
better balance um everything seems to

1593
01:10:55,719 --> 01:11:01,719
work better uh this this idea of

1594
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:04,719
applying reduced tillage uh to to huge

1595
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:07,679
effect positive effect is enhanced when

1596
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,679
the soil is in good

1597
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:13,279
condition here I just wanted to show how

1598
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:15,599
there's a synergistic effect to our

1599
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:19,359
management so we see soil Health on the

1600
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:22,760
y- AIS and years across the X if we

1601
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:24,479
apply U if we modify our management with

1602
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:26,800
uh finding windows for different cover

1603
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:28,279
crops or reducing AR tillage uh

1604
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,480
individually if we apply these

1605
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:34,279
managements we can increase our our soil

1606
01:11:31,479 --> 01:11:37,759
Health but if we can uh creatively put

1607
01:11:34,279 --> 01:11:41,319
them together and combine them uh with

1608
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:44,679
an overall holistic plan um we tend to

1609
01:11:41,319 --> 01:11:46,639
see faster and greater overall response

1610
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:48,560
what we call an additive effect of

1611
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:51,159
putting these positive management

1612
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,159
approaches

1613
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:59,760
together kind of a a opsis slide here um

1614
01:11:57,158 --> 01:12:01,158
showing the um soil Health Report on the

1615
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,560
left the one we're going to talk about

1616
01:12:01,158 --> 01:12:04,599
in just a minute as we go through the

1617
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,480
final management uh stages of

1618
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,560
interpreting this uh but we do want to

1619
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:11,879
remember that the uh the soil health

1620
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:15,440
tool soil Health Report is a tool um in

1621
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:19,600
a whole program of developing solutions

1622
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:21,919
to farm field uh Market

1623
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:24,400
issues um what we're talking about here

1624
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,239
is that we have this framework for

1625
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:28,599
guiding our soil

1626
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:30,638
management using these Pro using a

1627
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:33,039
process-based approach but in the

1628
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:35,400
context of the the Grower's needs and

1629
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:37,238
desires and uh

1630
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:39,638
limitations and I've mentioned this

1631
01:12:37,238 --> 01:12:42,799
several times but this idea of There's

1632
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:45,319
Always Forever on now uh there will be

1633
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:49,880
more and more information available um

1634
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:51,679
to people in the field um in terms of uh

1635
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:53,600
strategies other and Technologies other

1636
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,000
people are using and that's going to

1637
01:12:53,600 --> 01:13:00,239
require that we we stay a breast of this

1638
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:03,760
so that we can do our best job to um not

1639
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:06,919
not fall behind uh the rapid pace of U

1640
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:10,400
of soil management uh these

1641
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:12,679
days also I had to put this in as a um

1642
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:15,759
this idea to illustrate this idea of

1643
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:20,079
creativity um we really like

1644
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:22,520
um um this uh got a kind of a going from

1645
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:26,158
a a closed I like going from this idea

1646
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:28,120
of there a closed uh

1647
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:30,559
a closed mind that says there's we can't

1648
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:32,359
that this won't work here uh so uh we're

1649
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:35,360
dealing with some uh extension Folks up

1650
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:36,880
in Vermont um that said well we can't we

1651
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:39,198
can't put cover crops after our corn

1652
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,600
silage up here our growing season is too

1653
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:42,960
short and some Specialists up there said

1654
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,000
well wait a minute let's let's work with

1655
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,760
some of the Growers and see if we went

1656
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,158
to a for example a shorter season

1657
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,679
variety opening up a window of time at

1658
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:54,039
the end of the season for a cover crop

1659
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:59,199
um they they tried it they went with a

1660
01:13:54,039 --> 01:14:04,158
10day shorter corn variety for uh field

1661
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:06,319
for uh field corn and allowed them to um

1662
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:09,119
actually be successful with establishing

1663
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:12,119
a rye cover crop with these just just a

1664
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:15,238
few extra days gave them quite a quite a

1665
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:17,359
heads up on the on using the tried and

1666
01:14:15,238 --> 01:14:19,599
true older season varieties so it just

1667
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:22,880
goes I just wanted to show with this

1668
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,719
that um sometimes there's um with a

1669
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,920
little bit of risk or creativity risk

1670
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,239
and creativity kind of put together and

1671
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:30,520
try something as a little trial um we

1672
01:14:29,238 --> 01:14:33,319
can come up with something that's useful

1673
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,800
to perhaps a lot of

1674
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:38,039
people okay so I'm running over here so

1675
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,800
I'm going to go quickly uh through these

1676
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:42,920
last two steps step three and four of

1677
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,119
our uh uh soil Health Report here we

1678
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:47,600
said this was a um two-year strawberry

1679
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:49,519
field coming out of ryet two years ago

1680
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,560
uh this grower is willing to experiment

1681
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,840
with different cover crops he's

1682
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,560
considering transitioning to organic

1683
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,079
because the the market value

1684
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:59,280
he does have a dairy farm nearby just a

1685
01:14:57,079 --> 01:15:00,960
little bit of background on um who

1686
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:03,158
exactly this person or who specifically

1687
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:05,439
this person is so step three we say we

1688
01:15:03,158 --> 01:15:07,359
want to uh apply this uh the soil

1689
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:09,719
process information that we have in

1690
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:12,158
front of us with the uh situational

1691
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:15,920
opportunities where is this guy what's

1692
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:19,119
he up to what does he have at his

1693
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:21,039
disposal so we've listed it here step

1694
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:23,719
three uh this grower does have access to

1695
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:27,158
a grain drill uh this this local Dairy

1696
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:29,960
nearby uh has a deep ripping machine uh

1697
01:15:27,158 --> 01:15:32,279
for de possible decompaction this Darman

1698
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:35,439
will bring his big tractor and this

1699
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:37,519
Ripper uh to the field and and a person

1700
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:39,439
and we'll rip this up for and will

1701
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:42,600
agrees to rip this up for $100 per acre

1702
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:45,719
so this this is an8 acre field so for

1703
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,520
$800 um or to do half the field this

1704
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:50,760
Growers this Dairy Farmers is willing to

1705
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:52,840
come over and um experiment with that um

1706
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:56,560
the grower again is interested in cover

1707
01:15:52,840 --> 01:16:01,000
crop so he tends a workshop

1708
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:04,400
go to step four oops

1709
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,399
huh there one

1710
01:16:07,719 --> 01:16:13,439
moment be in step four so putting all

1711
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:15,119
this together sitting with the grower um

1712
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:17,079
the grower has come up with a management

1713
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:19,559
strategy for this year in the spring uh

1714
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:22,479
he's going to plow plow the field up and

1715
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:25,159
see the Ry vetch mustard mix and he's

1716
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:28,319
trying to uh get a sad forming cover

1717
01:16:25,158 --> 01:16:32,039
crop there with the Rye um the vet to

1718
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:35,039
supply um nitrogen as well as a deep Tap

1719
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:37,479
Root the mustard for some uh disease

1720
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:39,840
suppressive compounds uh he also wants

1721
01:16:37,479 --> 01:16:42,479
to try a strip trial of uh Rebeca or

1722
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:45,800
Andor switchgrass he learn this in his

1723
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:49,279
uh cover crop class um these uh these

1724
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:51,279
crops um have good um cover crop

1725
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:54,079
qualities and the organic debris from

1726
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:56,559
them uh is useful in uh maintenance of

1727
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,840
of soil Organics for

1728
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,880
strawberries this grower is proposing to

1729
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:06,000
then um flail moow and deep rip during

1730
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:08,279
2012 leaving all whatever in any of

1731
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,479
these uh

1732
01:17:08,279 --> 01:17:13,079
uh organic growth systems here including

1733
01:17:11,479 --> 01:17:14,319
a strip trial he's just going to mow

1734
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:16,479
that and leave it on the field so

1735
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:18,960
everything's U going to be grown and

1736
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:20,759
left uh left in place he may even

1737
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,679
consider a different cover crop if one

1738
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:26,239
of these doesn't uh pan out and then

1739
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:28,960
he'll decide based on the soil looks at

1740
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:31,359
as the season goes on in 2013 if he'll

1741
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:35,119
continue this cover cropping or perhaps

1742
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:35,119
go to a cash crop like sweet

1743
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:40,760
corn so that's the end of the

1744
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:43,399
presentation uh just listed here uh some

1745
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:45,760
of those ideas we've been over uh couple

1746
01:17:43,399 --> 01:17:48,519
of times during this this talk how the

1747
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:50,320
soil Health test identifying these soil

1748
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:52,320
constrain soil processes kind of the

1749
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,479
beginning uh we're going to keep those

1750
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:55,799
in mind as we think what might what

1751
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:59,319
might this this grower do or what might

1752
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:01,920
I do uh that get at to get at these uh

1753
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:04,840
constraints what can I try to see what

1754
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,840
will really work

1755
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:12,279
uh adapt many sources of

1756
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:13,920
information ultimately building the soil

1757
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:15,840
to increase this

1758
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,158
resiliency the extreme weather we're

1759
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,279
going to continue to

1760
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:23,079
see okay and with that I'll say thank

1761
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:25,279
you and uh open the uh the floor to

1762
01:18:23,079 --> 01:18:28,279
questions and I just would encourage

1763
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:30,079
anybody that's been participating to use

1764
01:18:28,279 --> 01:18:32,319
your chat box in the lower right hand

1765
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:35,840
corner and type in any questions that

1766
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:35,840
you may have so that Bob can

1767
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,800
respond uh Glenn had a comment his

1768
01:18:51,158 --> 01:18:58,719
comment was resiliency to extremes uh

1769
01:18:54,800 --> 01:19:00,800
interesting given increase in intense

1770
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:03,198
rains I don't know whether you have any

1771
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:05,639
comments to that

1772
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:08,158
Bob right well I I kind of mentioned

1773
01:19:05,639 --> 01:19:11,319
this at one point um any time right when

1774
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:12,920
a soil is degraded it's uh it's already

1775
01:19:11,319 --> 01:19:15,679
down and then when we get extreme

1776
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:18,079
weather it's then then it gets kicked so

1777
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:20,279
to speak um but when it when we can

1778
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:24,000
build a soil and certainly protect the

1779
01:19:20,279 --> 01:19:26,439
surface um but that surface can also be

1780
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,600
protected if you will internally by

1781
01:19:26,439 --> 01:19:31,879
getting organic matter um to break down

1782
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,679
in between these particles and help glue

1783
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:36,760
them together again building our soil

1784
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:39,199
structure um in particular really uh

1785
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:41,280
really uh gives the that's the

1786
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:42,638
foundation if you will the house they

1787
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:45,479
talk about soil structure being the

1788
01:19:42,639 --> 01:19:48,199
house um of the for the soil microbes to

1789
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:50,919
live within uh we can you know kind of

1790
01:19:48,198 --> 01:19:54,079
build that or as we build that uh we're

1791
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:56,480
just um making a a more stable

1792
01:19:54,079 --> 01:20:00,679
environment for whatever is thrown at us

1793
01:19:56,479 --> 01:20:03,319
be it um heavy rains or drought um from

1794
01:20:00,679 --> 01:20:06,480
what we've seen at least in this area uh

1795
01:20:03,319 --> 01:20:08,559
this winter it's been um very different

1796
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:11,519
than what we're used to but uh I think

1797
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:15,480
we can get we should get used to um

1798
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:17,040
non-typical weather um so that said

1799
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:19,439
we're going to have to modify our

1800
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:22,238
management so that non-typical weather

1801
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:24,359
isn't as hurtful or damaging as it as it

1802
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:26,559
could be so that's going to take again

1803
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:28,960
that's of creativity that kind of uh

1804
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:31,080
hedging The Bets with u with management

1805
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:34,359
to get at processes that are going to

1806
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:36,119
leave us in a better better better um

1807
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:39,920
better position to weather pardon the

1808
01:20:36,119 --> 01:20:39,920
pun um the weather that

1809
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:44,519
comes I I do want to mention in your

1810
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:46,920
discussion you were talking about

1811
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:49,880
compost and I think people equate

1812
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:53,199
compost with a lot of uh very positive

1813
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:54,639
um attributes and I will say that you

1814
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:56,599
know one of the things listed there was

1815
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,079
Municipal compost I would just encourage

1816
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:01,760
people to be a little careful with

1817
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:05,279
Municipal composts they they you should

1818
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:08,119
really ask for an analysis and a heavy

1819
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:10,319
met metal analysis of those kinds of

1820
01:21:08,119 --> 01:21:12,399
products and even the heavy metal

1821
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:16,759
analyses can be a little

1822
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:19,599
misinforming um we had uh a composting

1823
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:22,600
Facility in Syracuse area and Syracuse

1824
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:24,400
has some industry in it it's not just a

1825
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:27,639
residential Community where you'd expect

1826
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:29,719
like things like copper in compost made

1827
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:33,719
from those materials but it had some

1828
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:36,158
light industry in Syracuse and they used

1829
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:38,679
uh lime at I think it was close to

1830
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:42,679
onethird of the dry matter weight of the

1831
01:21:38,679 --> 01:21:45,319
material uh as let's say an Adent uh to

1832
01:21:42,679 --> 01:21:48,960
help processes along to reduce the

1833
01:21:45,319 --> 01:21:53,639
pathogen level down and in the process

1834
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:56,158
it does tie up um heavy metals and when

1835
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:59,760
they did the testing to test what the

1836
01:21:56,158 --> 01:22:01,559
heavy metal levels were uh they were not

1837
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,840
really available at really super high

1838
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:07,440
PHS which this turned out to be and a

1839
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:09,679
homeowner could be uh fooled and

1840
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:11,879
purchased or a grower could be fooled

1841
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:15,239
and purchased material thinking that it

1842
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:17,520
really didn't have any heavy metals in

1843
01:22:15,238 --> 01:22:17,519
it
