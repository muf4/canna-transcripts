tobacco with his family. He received a

25
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,879
bachelor's and master's degrees in

26
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,118
aronomy from the University of Kentucky

27
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:22,640
and a PhD in soil chemistry from the

28
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:25,040
University of Georgia. During his more

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,200
than 30 years as an extension specialist

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,040
in Kentucky, he has conducted field

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,478
research and extension programming on

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,920
transplant production systems, soil

33
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:37,000
fertility, conservation, tillage

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,840
methods, and sucker control programs for

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,920
tobacco. Currently, Dr. Pier's hemp

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,159
research focus is on best economic

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,240
management practices, sustainability,

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,118
and rotational cropping systems for

39
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,438
field production. He coordinates the

40
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,840
broad hemp research efforts for the

41
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:56,239
college and assists researchers

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,960
interested in hemp with securing funding

43
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,519
and accessing them raw materials to

44
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,519
support the research efforts. Um

45
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,840
remember that we are recording the

46
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,478
webinars and we've recorded all of the

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,399
webinars so far and we've uploaded them

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,120
to our school of integrative plant

49
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,199
science YouTube channel. And without

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,680
further ado, please. Yeah, thank you

51
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,919
very much for the introduction and uh

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,040
appreciate everybody for for joining

53
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:26,079
today and and uh listening to this talk.

54
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,000
So, um I've made a slight adjustment to

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
my my title. This is one of those things

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,598
where you agree to do something and then

57
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,359
it's time to submit the title. So, you

58
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,318
submit, you know, the first thing that

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,760
pops into your mind and uh then you

60
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,439
start preparing for it and and you

61
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,759
think, well, why did I submit that?

62
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,120
because I think it would be a bit

63
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,878
premature at this stage for me to say

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,599
that I'm going to talk about the best

65
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,560
management practices for agronomic or

66
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,639
agronomic practices for grain hemp um

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,039
because we're still in the process of

68
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,958
developing those. And so I think a

69
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,719
better title for this topic is that

70
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,158
we're going to talk about better

71
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:05,120
agronomic uh practices for uh for grain

72
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,439
hemp. And in order to to do that, I'm

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,120
going to start uh by giving just a

74
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,919
little bit of a background of of my

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,920
journey with hemp. Um and so hemp was

76
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,119
not really on my radar. I was a tobacco

77
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:23,280
specialist uh working along and then in

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,360
in 2014 uh the farm bill allowed states

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,598
in the US to begin conducting research

80
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,360
on hemp. Prior to that, hemp was lumped

81
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,039
in with with marijuana. It was all

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,680
considered a schedule one controlled

83
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,840
substance. And so no no no research was

84
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,879
really being done on it um you know out

85
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,598
in the in the field certainly and a

86
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,518
colleague of mine uh Dr. David Williams

87
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,959
uh stepped up to initially lead the

88
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,519
program here at the University of

89
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,439
Kentucky uh beginning with that 2014

90
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,879
farm

91
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,680
bill. I was sort of there on the

92
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,518
periphery. Um tobacco had already

93
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,040
started to decline at that point and we

94
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,959
knew that that was going to continue.

95
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,598
So, our tobacco growers were were

96
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,799
looking at other options and my interest

97
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:07,518
in hemp was really in in trying to find

98
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,680
other things for our tobacco growers uh

99
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,319
that that they could grow and apply

100
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:18,000
their knowledge to. So, um between uh uh

101
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:21,039
between 2016 and 2018, I had uh about

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,959
one trial a year working with hemp. And

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,199
uh to say the least, my initial attempts

104
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,879
at growing hemp were were certainly less

105
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,199
than spectacular. Um poor stands. I had

106
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,800
a lot of difficulty. Um you know, when

107
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,800
hemp came in, everybody was talking

108
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,199
about what an easy plant this was to

109
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,918
grow. Um so, you know, it had me

110
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,240
questioning my agronomic abilities. Uh

111
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,799
but I soon learned that a lot of us were

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,639
really struggling with uh just how to

113
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:52,560
manage this this new new to us uh in

114
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,960
many cases. uh plant. But with that

115
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,879
experience, um a year later,

116
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,560
unfortunately, uh Dr. Williams was

117
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,079
diagnosed with the with the terminal

118
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,519
illness and he and others asked me if I

119
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,478
could step in to um take uh a little

120
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,719
more uh part of the of the hemp program.

121
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,560
And so I became the interim director of

122
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,280
hemp programs and later the director of

123
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,439
hemp programs here at the the college in

124
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,319
2019. And that was a really busy year

125
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,240
for us. Um Dr. Williams had already set

126
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,120
up a lot of things that were were in

127
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,199
place. We had a visit from the the then

128
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,800
US Secretary of Agriculture, Sunonny

129
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,400
Purdue, our Senate leader, uh Mitch

130
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,560
McConnell. And fortunately, uh with some

131
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:38,560
help from uh Wade Turner and our crew at

132
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,199
the Quicksand location that had been

133
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,280
helping David previously, uh we were

134
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,000
able to get some good good stands going

135
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:49,038
so our politicians had a nice backdrop

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,439
uh for their for their photo op. Um, we

137
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,959
also had multiple visits from USDA

138
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,560
agencies that year from ARS and RMA and

139
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,799
NRCS

140
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,959
um coming to to see what hemp production

141
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,160
was uh was all about. Um, we had a a

142
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,638
massive field day. Over 600 people from

143
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,039
uh 25 different states in the US and I

144
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,960
think four or five different countries

145
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:18,120
um came that year to uh in in August uh

146
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:21,439
to view our plots. Um,

147
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,439
and during this time in a in about a

148
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,918
four to six month period, I went from

149
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,959
being a a you know, just on the

150
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:33,399
periphery of the hemp program, uh, to to

151
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:37,198
being, um, a an aronomy hemp aronomy,

152
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:39,359
uh, expert, so to speak. And so, uh,

153
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,520
that was that was quite a whirlwind. And

154
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,080
in the backdrop, all of this was was

155
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:47,279
going on, uh, was the what I call the

156
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:50,000
CBD hemp boom and bust. Uh we went from

157
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,839
about 5,000 acres of hemp in Kentucky to

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,360
26,000

159
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:58,799
uh in 2019 and then back down again um

160
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,560
to about 5,000 the year after. So it was

161
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,720
a you know really really whirlwind kind

162
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,478
of a ride in

163
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,080
2019. In 2020, things were beginning to

164
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,680
calm down a little bit and of course we

165
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,120
hit COVID, but uh been in the process of

166
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,280
of building our hemp aronomy research

167
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,680
program. Um we have had a bit of

168
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:26,239
research on uh CBD or uh floral type

169
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,560
hemp. Uh but really have have built a

170
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,840
lot of our program around grain and and

171
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,918
fiber uh production. And in order to to

172
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,399
do that, had to put together a good team

173
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:39,038
of folks.

174
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:42,000
Um, Tara was my my field technician uh

175
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:44,639
field manager initially. Uh, John Weey

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,079
has has taken that over for the last uh

177
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,160
year or so since Tara went back to

178
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:52,639
Pennsylvania. Tom Keane uh Wade Turner

179
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,599
who I mentioned and their crew uh that

180
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,120
helped us with a lot of the planting. Uh

181
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:03,680
Natalya is my lab manager. um Manahar

182
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,918
and Andrea um postocs in my lab working

183
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:11,038
on uh seed seed quality seed germination

184
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:14,079
issues. Um Magdalina uh is a PhD

185
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,918
candidate working primarily on uh

186
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,839
integrated pest management and working

187
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:21,918
directly with u Dr. Gocha whom I think

188
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,959
you you heard from earlier this year in

189
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:29,439
this seminar series and also with our

190
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:32,639
enemologist uh Dr. uh via AVA. Um and

191
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:36,080
then Paul Coxin's a PhD uh student in my

192
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:38,879
lab uh that is is working on uh root

193
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,320
growth and seedling bigger. And then

194
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,759
we've had a whole host of of

195
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,159
undergraduate workers who have come

196
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,319
through the lab in the last five years

197
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,439
uh that have been incredibly valuable in

198
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,278
in working on these projects. Also need

199
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,040
to take just a moment to acknowledge our

200
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,559
funders uh because that's been an

201
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,679
important part of what we've been able

202
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:00,559
to do. Um we started with a with a

203
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:04,159
project from a company called Pixus. Uh

204
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,359
that lasted about a year. Um had a

205
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,679
couple of projects with the hemp

206
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,639
research consortium in conjunction with

207
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:13,519
both Cornell and uh North Carolina State

208
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:16,240
University. We've been very fortunate uh

209
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:20,560
to have a good relationship with a local

210
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,839
with our local um USDA ARS lab here in

211
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:27,039
in Lexington. and in the last couple of

212
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:31,200
years have have developed uh a project

213
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:33,360
uh collaborating with the uh uh plant

214
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,959
genetic resources unit there in New York

215
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,159
as well with Zach and Tyler uh as well

216
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,439
as some funding through USDA NEA to help

217
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,799
keep our our program

218
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,880
going. So, I mentioned that I'd done a

219
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,879
lot of back in 2019 was doing a lot of

220
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:52,879
national webinars and some things like

221
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:57,360
that. And this is a slide that I used uh

222
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:59,120
quite a bit then um just to try to help

223
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,440
folks understand what we really didn't

224
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,278
know at the time about hemp and and

225
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,959
where we

226
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,039
uh many of the things that we needed to

227
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:10,518
to learn about. And a lot of this is

228
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:13,679
still applicable today. Um you know

229
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,759
initially uh we didn't have hardly any

230
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,199
information about the varieties. All of

231
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,799
the all of the varieties or the

232
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,440
cultivars that we were getting at that

233
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,519
time were generally being imported from

234
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,880
out of the

235
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,480
country and you know there hadn't been

236
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,639
any breeding efforts or anything that

237
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,278
had taken place in the in the US for

238
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:35,838
many many years. Um so we had a lot to

239
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:38,320
learn about uh cultivars. Um, initially

240
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,160
again we were just getting seed from all

241
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,320
over the place. The quality was highly

242
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,799
variable and and not too good in many

243
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,000
cases. We had a lot of issues with stand

244
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,519
establishment. Uh, I'm not going to talk

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,759
anything about the transplant

246
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,078
production. That was primarily um, you

247
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,360
know, work that we were doing for u

248
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,879
floral production. So I'm going to

249
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,200
concentrate more on the grain today. Um,

250
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,120
the next one, the the fertility

251
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,640
management is honestly, you know, when I

252
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,399
went into this, I thought that this is

253
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,480
where I'm going to make my mark because

254
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,120
of my training in in soil chemistry and

255
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,360
soil fertility. Um, but I found out

256
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,078
pretty quickly

257
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,240
that if we don't have the proper variety

258
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,719
or cultivar, and if we can't

259
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,879
consistently establish stand, is very

260
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,360
difficult to do meaningful fertility

261
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,120
management work. And so we had to tackle

262
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,839
some of these other issues before we

263
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,600
could even begin to fine-tune some of

264
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,040
our recommendations uh with regards to

265
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,720
that. And then, you know, we had a we

266
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,719
did have a lack of of registered

267
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,959
pesticides. That's still a bit the case,

268
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,040
although we've got more more options now

269
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,799
than we we did. Um and then we still are

270
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,039
are working out, you know, some

271
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,958
appropriate harvest uh and post-h

272
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:54,719
harvest processing methods. And I'll I

273
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:58,078
will um make some uh ending comments on

274
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,519
on that um this afternoon when I when I

275
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,799
get there uh to the to the end of the

276
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,799
presentation. Um I also made this

277
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,879
comment at the time. This was when you

278
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,240
know the CBD floral hemp was going like

279
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,919
gang busters and and growers were

280
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,639
receiving recommendations in some cases

281
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:17,360
not not good recommendations from all

282
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,480
sorts of people. um and that you know

283
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,399
industry was was moving faster than than

284
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,519
research was being able to keep up with

285
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,360
appropriate production practices. Um

286
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,519
since the industry's cooled off, we we

287
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,278
begin to get a a little bit head of more

288
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,440
ahead of that curve, but we still got a

289
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,278
long ways to go. So, I'm primarily going

290
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,639
to kind of focus on the things that my

291
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:41,360
group my my lab has been doing uh around

292
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,600
cultivars and seed quality and stand

293
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,000
establishment in in hemp today. Those

294
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,240
are are going to be my focus areas uh

295
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,159
for

296
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:54,120
today. So when it comes to

297
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:56,879
um gaining more knowledge about uh

298
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,360
cultivars uh we are a participant and in

299
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,919
fact coordinate the the multi-state

300
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,000
dualpurpose trial which dual is is grain

301
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:09,278
and fiber uh as part of the S1084 USDA

302
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,440
multi-state project. This began in 2019

303
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,919
and actually David Williams was was

304
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,920
quite instrumental in getting S1084 up

305
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,799
and running and had already volunteered

306
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:21,439
to coordinate this

307
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:23,838
um project. And so then he turned that

308
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,000
that over to me. And we have about

309
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,440
anywhere from about 12 to we've had as

310
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,159
many as 20 um universities participating

311
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,600
in this um in this project in any one

312
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:38,879
year. Um and typically we select a group

313
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,839
of 12 to 15 cultivars uh that go out to

314
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,439
all of those those folks. Now you know

315
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,519
some of the challenges that we've had

316
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,360
with that is that the availability of

317
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,440
seed changes from year to year. So

318
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,800
keeping the consistent list of seeds has

319
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,200
been difficult. Uh many of the owners of

320
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,399
these cultivars require material

321
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,639
transfer agreements and so there's um

322
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:05,440
some um legal barriers at times uh that

323
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,320
universities don't want to uh agree to

324
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,000
all of the requirements under those or

325
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,519
um you know just a matter of trying to

326
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,159
to get uh get everybody to to agree uh

327
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,839
on what needs to be in those um those

328
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,078
agreements.

329
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,160
stand establishment. Um you'll hear that

330
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,439
as a common theme throughout my talk

331
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:27,838
today. Uh is has been challenging. Uh

332
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,440
weed pressure. Not to mention the fact

333
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:34,160
that that this is a rather massive and

334
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,320
uh somewhat messy data set when we've

335
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:39,039
got all these different uh participants

336
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,920
and uh different cultivars and and

337
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:44,078
things like that going on. And I'll just

338
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,399
point out in the in the picture here uh

339
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,559
when we first started this process uh we

340
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,879
didn't have a lot of funding uh to go

341
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,879
with it. And so we were using a lot of

342
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,600
handme-down equipment. So this is an old

343
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,159
tractor from the turf unit. Uh this was

344
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,720
an old soybean cone planter that we had

345
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:04,399
modified. It was a 16-in um planter and

346
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,000
in order to get the narrow rows that we

347
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,278
wanted, we actually had to drive two

348
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,240
passes over over every row uh of plants

349
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:16,600
in order to to get the uh the row

350
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,680
spacing that we wanted. So, quite a few

351
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,639
challenges. We just recently published

352
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:25,039
uh and this just came out in in January

353
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,320
of this year uh the first three years

354
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:31,078
from 2019 to 2021 of the multi-state

355
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,879
data.

356
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,399
Um want to acknowledge uh Dr. Zach Brim

357
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,000
at the University of Florida and his

358
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,958
student Ajet uh who dove into this

359
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,278
massive messy data set and did the uh

360
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,278
did the analysis and really wrote the

361
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,439
first draft and and led that publication

362
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,759
effort into all the co-authors for

363
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,199
getting this this information out there.

364
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,320
And I'm just going to share with you a

365
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:58,958
couple of of excerpts of this this data.

366
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,040
um 2019 I don't even think we knew

367
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,000
enough or we we hadn't developed the

368
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,639
program enough to to request that

369
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,320
everybody do a a stand count prior to

370
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,240
harvest. So we didn't have data for that

371
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:16,079
year. But for 2020 and 2021 uh we got

372
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,278
some uh pop plant population data at

373
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:21,120
harvest. uh in

374
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:23,278
2020. Well, in 2019, everything was

375
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,120
planted at the same rate, just a

376
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:29,519
straight u number of of kilograms per

377
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,480
hectare of seed regardless of

378
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,399
germination or um or seed size. In 2020,

379
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,839
we corrected for germination. And

380
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,078
finally in 2021 we corrected the the

381
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,199
seeding rates for both germination and

382
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:48,559
seed size so that we were approaching a

383
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:52,159
target of about one and a half million

384
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:54,078
seeds live seeds per hectare. And you

385
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,879
can see that again getting back to our

386
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:59,039
theme on stand establishment our our

387
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,600
established stands or our harvested

388
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,879
stands on average were only about a

389
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,240
third uh of that

390
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:09,519
target. And you can see across our

391
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,919
different locations um there was a wide

392
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:15,439
range of populations. We only had seven

393
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,520
cultivars uh that were were consistently

394
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,720
included in the trials over the those

395
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:24,240
years. Anka, CFX1,

396
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,439
uh Katani and X59 were all uh of

397
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,160
Canadian origin and the others were of

398
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,279
Eastern European uh origin of the of the

399
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,200
cultivars that we had. And in all of

400
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:38,359
these these next sets of of graphs,

401
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,600
you'll see those um those seven

402
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:43,599
cultivars, our locations are colorcoded.

403
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,439
Uh starting with kind of the dark purple

404
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,599
and going to a lighter purple and then

405
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,960
coming to a light green and going to a

406
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:53,359
darker green. That represents a north

407
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,919
south gradient with purple being the

408
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:59,038
northernmost and the dark green being

409
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,880
the southernmost of the locations. Uh

410
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,720
incidentally, we did have during this

411
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,400
same time frame, we had locations

412
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,919
attempted in uh in Alabama and

413
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,600
Louisiana, but um they never were were

414
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:16,640
able to get u enough uh enough stands or

415
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:19,279
enough yields at that time um to to be

416
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,840
put into the to the data set because of

417
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,678
some of the

418
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:26,798
challenges. If we look at grain yields,

419
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,559
um pretty low in in 2019. Everybody was

420
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:32,639
really just kind of in a in a learning

421
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:35,038
mode at that point. Uh 2020 2021 we did

422
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,759
a little bit better, but you you do

423
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,599
begin to kind of notice this north south

424
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,200
gradient

425
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,319
uh with some of the more northern

426
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,160
locations doing well. Uh in Kentucky

427
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:50,319
where these uh light green uh bars down

428
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,279
here at the bottom, we really struggled.

429
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:55,519
Uh in in 19 we did okay. We had some

430
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,279
decent yields there, but in 2020 and

431
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,079
2021,

432
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,798
um we were we were struggling with uh

433
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,279
with establishment. After 21, we made

434
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,679
some changes to our rotation and to our

435
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:12,000
planting methods and and things began to

436
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:15,120
to improve uh after that. Overall, uh,

437
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,119
X59 CFX1, uh, out of this group of

438
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,000
cultivars, you know, tended to be the

439
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,918
ones that that had the the best, uh,

440
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,960
grain yields, and those are indicated by

441
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,720
these solid black dots, uh, with the

442
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,400
with the error bars on them. That was

443
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,400
the the overall uh overall locations

444
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,080
means for for those

445
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,880
cultivars. our fiber or straw yield.

446
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,359
Again, very low in 2019, uh quite

447
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,039
variable in 2020. And you really uh with

448
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,879
fiber yields, you really start to see

449
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:49,200
this north south gradient in in yields

450
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,679
there. Um Anka and some of the Eastern

451
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,160
European cultivars generally uh on

452
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,919
average were a little bit better uh a

453
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:01,600
little bit more consistent for fiber

454
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:03,679
production uh than CFX and X59.

455
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:07,839
So, you know, we've learned a lot from

456
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,759
from those early uh early seasons uh

457
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,720
about which varieties are are better

458
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,640
suited to certain

459
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:18,079
uses. We're working on compiling the

460
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,600
2022 to 2024 uh data and hopefully we're

461
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,079
going to we're already beginning to work

462
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,918
on a on a publication for that. I'll

463
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,240
just give you a quick summary and

464
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,120
apologize I don't have a uh a nice

465
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,839
pretty graph uh put together yet for the

466
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:35,519
for the 2024 data. So, we've got

467
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:38,000
locations across the top here, cultivars

468
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,240
going down this way, and our cultivar

469
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,798
averages. Uh, this is for grain yield

470
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,279
across all locations over here on the

471
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:48,480
far right hand side um of the

472
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,798
table. You know, couple of things that

473
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,000
that I'll point out. You can see we we

474
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,480
have gotten a little bit better

475
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,839
certainly in our locations in Kentucky

476
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:02,079
going from some um you know sub 500

477
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:04,558
pound yields to uh over close

478
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,678
approaching 1500 pound yields in in this

479
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:10,158
trial. Um of course we'd all like to uh

480
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,080
figure out what Heather Darby up at the

481
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,880
University of Vermont is doing what her

482
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,879
secret sauce is for uh for getting these

483
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,080
kinds of yield sheet. She had a a really

484
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,679
good production year up there. Um, and

485
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,678
overall we're we're seeing, you know,

486
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:28,798
we've got some some cultivars like

487
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:32,320
Futura 83 um that are performing uh

488
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:34,960
fairly consistently across uh across a a

489
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,960
large number of locations. So, we're

490
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,919
definitely seeing some improvements in

491
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,120
that variety trial

492
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:44,960
program. When it comes to fiber

493
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:47,119
production, um similar sort of thing. Uh

494
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,079
here we've got Ursa Alulta which of

495
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:52,319
course is developed at at Cornell uh

496
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,240
being the the overall the best fiber

497
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,079
producer uh that we had in the

498
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,960
multi-state last year. Of course it

499
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:01,199
didn't produce much seed uh only we only

500
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,159
had seed at the our grain really at the

501
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,240
Kentucky location um but we harvested it

502
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,480
really late

503
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:13,120
there. So, you know, we're beginning to

504
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,319
amass uh a body of information uh about

505
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:18,599
at least some of these different

506
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:21,119
cultivars over a wide range of u of

507
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:23,279
conditions. And I wanted to put up this

508
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,359
up here because in addition to the

509
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,359
multi-state cultivars, which are these

510
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:31,199
here on the left hand side of of this

511
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:35,678
graph, and again, we've got our yields

512
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:39,679
now approaching uh 1,500 lb uh of grain

513
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,679
uh raw grain per acre.

514
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:44,639
Um, we had some additional cultivars

515
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,879
that aren't in the the multi-state trial

516
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,480
that we were just triing locally uh

517
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,120
where we're actually even getting better

518
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,880
yields than that. Um, and some of these

519
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:57,839
are are experimental uh cultur breeding

520
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,679
lines. Uh, some of them are hybrids. So,

521
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,918
we tested our first hybrid about two

522
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,798
years ago and we're we're getting more

523
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,880
and more hybrids in into the trials. So,

524
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:14,440
I'm I'm very uh optimistic uh about our

525
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:17,000
opportunities to to improve yields um

526
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,200
through through better cultivar

527
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,038
selection. And you know, I think it's

528
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,519
been just been a very short time over

529
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,279
the last four or five years and we're

530
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,879
already beginning to to see some pretty

531
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:30,599
significant improvements there. So, I'm

532
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,840
very optimistic about seeing that uh

533
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:36,719
continue. So future directions for our

534
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,480
cultivar trials or variety trials. Uh as

535
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:44,000
I said, we're working on publication of

536
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:47,200
the 22 to 2022 to 2024 data. Um we want

537
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,279
to continue to evaluate these u range of

538
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,120
cultivars across different environments.

539
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,158
And you know, one of the things we've

540
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:58,079
discussed as a as a goal for our group

541
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,000
is to work towards developing a a system

542
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,240
much like we have for soybean of

543
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
different maturity groups uh that would

544
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,599
help in the selection of hemp cultivars

545
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,798
for different

546
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,319
latitudes. Uh certainly we want to try

547
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,639
to get some of these new breeding lines

548
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,639
and improved hybrids and cultivars uh

549
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,038
into our trials. Continue to develop

550
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,200
best management practices.

551
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,200
um working on refining our measurements

552
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,840
and evaluations especially when it comes

553
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,919
to like flowering so we can can work on

554
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:29,359
developing this grouping system and

555
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:32,400
we're working with uh with Zach Stanzel

556
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:35,278
uh and the phenotyping guide uh that

557
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,240
that they've put together to try to to

558
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:40,960
work on our u on our methods for

559
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,798
evaluating this and also refining our

560
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,840
integrated pest management practices

561
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,079
with regards to to these different uh

562
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,439
cultivars.

563
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:51,759
cars. So, I want to switch gears a

564
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,960
little bit and start talking uh more

565
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:57,759
about some of our infield establishment

566
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:00,159
work. Uh going back to 2019, uh went

567
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,879
back and I, you know, got some seed size

568
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,080
information and germination information

569
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,919
on on the seed lots that we had and then

570
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,639
went back and looked at our population

571
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,360
counts that we had. And, you know, I I

572
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,480
thought we had really good stands in

573
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,158
2019. Um, but it was kind of

574
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,319
disappointing to look and see that we

575
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,840
still were were just kind of hovering

576
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:25,599
around 50% establishment. Meaning that

577
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:29,119
50% of the live seed that we planted

578
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:31,359
resulted in a a harvestable plant. Uh,

579
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,359
which agonomically speaking is just is

580
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,359
not not really acceptable for a

581
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,798
commodity crop. If you think about corn

582
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:41,639
or soybean or even wheat, um you know,

583
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:44,720
you you're certainly your expectation is

584
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,880
for better efficiency than that in terms

585
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,798
of of the amount of seed planted to the

586
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:54,159
number of plants that are are

587
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:56,960
harvested. So, uh Paul uh my my PhD

588
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,960
student has been taking a a closer look

589
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:04,159
at some of this establishment um and

590
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,759
looking at at population counts. Um and

591
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,960
what we had there was just counts that

592
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:12,079
were taken um sort of 14 days after we

593
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,720
after we planted. Um Paul did a little

594
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,558
more intensive counts uh starting at 3

595
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,839
days after planting and every two days

596
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:21,918
thereafter went out and counted the

597
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,079
number of plants uh for the first 23

598
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,440
days which we kind of considered that to

599
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:30,480
be our establishment period uh of what

600
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,440
was was going on um there. And he did

601
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,839
this for a selected group of cultivars

602
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,759
that were in our cultivar trials. And so

603
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:41,119
for example, this was in the fiber trial

604
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:44,240
in in 2023. Um you can see there our

605
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:47,839
best performing cultivar in terms of

606
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,200
establishment was Fedora 17. Uh and we

607
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:53,759
got you know close to to 90%

608
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,519
uh of the seed that was planted was

609
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,839
appeared to be established by the end of

610
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:00,400
the establishment period. And we had a

611
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:04,678
range, you know, down to about 70%

612
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:08,159
establishment for uh for the cultivar

613
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:10,159
Yuma. We also did our our typical uh

614
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,320
population counts at harvest right

615
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,480
before we harvested materials. And you

616
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,319
can see that in almost all cases, we we

617
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,640
lost a considerable number of plants

618
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,639
from the end of the establishment period

619
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,919
to the to the time of of harvest.

620
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,278
Um, so not only do we have the initial

621
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,360
establishment, we also have this loss of

622
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,880
plants that's that's occurring. And

623
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:34,519
that's been something that's been pretty

624
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,200
consistent uh throughout a lot of our

625
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:40,960
trials. Uh, for a dual purpose trial in

626
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:45,120
2023, um, lower lower target population

627
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,880
of 32 plants per per linear meter. Um,

628
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,719
and we didn't get quite as high a um

629
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,159
establishment rate as what we did in the

630
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,278
fiber trial, but still Fedora 17 here in

631
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:00,480
the purple um was our best uh our best

632
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:03,839
establishing cultivar in in both trials

633
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,000
um that that particular year did did

634
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,558
very well for both. But again, we see

635
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,038
that there was between the the end of

636
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:14,398
establishment and uh and the harvest

637
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,200
period, we are continuing to lose some

638
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,959
plants along the

639
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,840
way. Now, I'm going to go back to this

640
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,079
one, and you'll notice that this was in

641
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:28,558
2023. These cultivars, you know, we were

642
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:31,599
approaching uh 20 to maybe 25 plants per

643
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:36,079
linear meter uh relative to our target

644
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:39,439
of 32. uh 2024, same cultivars, same

645
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,439
planting system. Um planted about two

646
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,679
weeks later because we had had some some

647
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,240
wet weather and then we got uh fairly

648
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:50,000
hot and dry. And you can see our

649
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,120
establishment was was uh much less in

650
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,440
2024 uh under under those conditions.

651
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,439
And this was also we did have irrigation

652
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:03,278
that we were applying. So was wasn't

653
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,880
just a moisture um moisture deficit. Um

654
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:08,240
there was something going on with the

655
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,880
temperatures were warmer as well and uh

656
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,440
just conditions were were were different

657
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,520
in 2024. And so again we're we're having

658
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,679
this this issue with you know we got

659
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,558
good stand establishment in one year and

660
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,480
then not so good in the the next year.

661
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,480
Even with these lower populations, we're

662
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,640
still seeing some drop off in the

663
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,640
numbers of plants. By the time we get to

664
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,360
harvest, we've only got well, we've got

665
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,000
less than than 30%

666
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:37,319
uh of the live seed we planted,

667
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,079
resulting in a in a harvestable

668
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:42,558
plant. Now, another thing that that Paul

669
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:44,720
did in his counts was he didn't do this

670
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,879
with every count, but at least once a

671
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,159
week, he was counting the number of

672
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,080
nodes on each plant. And so this is a

673
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,080
representation of the number of plants

674
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,639
within each row that that had a certain

675
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,079
number of nodes on them. And so, you

676
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,360
know, you can see we start out with

677
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:04,158
with, you know, u one, two, three, and

678
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:06,240
four node plants. Then a week later,

679
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,120
we've got some five node plants, six

680
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,720
node plants that are are coming in. Um,

681
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,038
and you know, we don't have as many

682
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,600
small plants. The interesting thing and

683
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:19,119
we saw this on several occasions was

684
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:22,639
that three weeks after planting when it

685
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:24,398
came to count now we have you know we

686
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,880
all our plants had grown beyond the one

687
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:29,719
and new to two node stage but now we've

688
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,720
got more one and two node plants showing

689
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:36,880
up which is suggesting to us that we we

690
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,880
have secondary flushes of seed emergence

691
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,120
plant emergence that are are going on.

692
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,559
And so we've got this established canopy

693
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:46,000
and then these smaller plants coming in

694
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:47,759
underneath. And so while these might be

695
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,558
counted towards our establishment

696
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,079
period, uh they you know some of these

697
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:57,720
plants may or may not compete

698
00:30:52,079 --> 00:31:01,359
successfully to to uh become harvestable

699
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:04,159
plants. And Paul did observe uh you know

700
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:07,359
some some plant loss. Um you know we had

701
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:11,200
some um wilting of plants which we

702
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:14,558
presume uh is probably dampening off. Uh

703
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,200
we had predation by insects uh chewing

704
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:20,079
on plants both you know what we called

705
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,080
larger bivvery and smaller bivvery which

706
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,240
would be things more like flea beetle.

707
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,639
And then there were some some instances

708
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,839
of of just necrotic tissues that we

709
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,360
couldn't explain um from environmental

710
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:34,879
stressors that were happening in the in

711
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,038
the plant. So we did know that there

712
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,799
were some we were losing some plants

713
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:42,720
during that establishment period.

714
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,960
So what we've seen from this is that you

715
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,919
know these inadequate stands you know

716
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,000
may be a result of low initial emergence

717
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,240
seeds that that never emerge which is

718
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,480
what we saw seem to see a lot of in in

719
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,640
2024. Seedling death that occurs during

720
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,440
the establishment phase itself while the

721
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,519
plants are still young. And then we've

722
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,519
got this loss of established plants

723
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,798
occurring through the growing season.

724
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,200
And these are all areas that we need

725
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,519
additional research on in order to to

726
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,080
really understand what's going on with

727
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,640
our population dynamics uh through the

728
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:23,119
season with uh grain and fiber

729
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:26,080
hemp. So one area of study that we have

730
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,079
have worked on in my lab is looking at

731
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:30,000
seed

732
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:32,558
quality. Initially our seed lots were

733
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,679
were pretty poor. Uh a lot of the seed

734
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:37,440
lots we were getting. you know, we would

735
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,798
have seed lots with 60 or uh 70% uh

736
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,720
germination rates and these were

737
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,960
standard germination in a growth

738
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,480
chamber, not not what we were get seeing

739
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,079
in the in the field.

740
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,319
Um, hemp presents a challenge I think

741
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:53,359
for seed producers because of the way it

742
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:55,038
matures um and the fact that at any time

743
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,158
that they harvest there's going to be a

744
00:32:55,038 --> 00:33:00,480
certain proportion of immature seed. Uh

745
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,559
also, you know, hemp seed apparently

746
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,880
does not store well, particularly at

747
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,240
high temperatures. Uh and certainly if

748
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,000
you have high moisture and high

749
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,278
temperatures, um then those those seeds

750
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,440
won't won't store as well. But um you

751
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,919
know, we've been doing cold storage for

752
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,080
the last several years and having much

753
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,960
better luck with preserving our our seed

754
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:24,639
lots that we've got and also I think uh

755
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,840
the germination of seed lots has

756
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,840
improved. Um, we do adjust all of our

757
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,639
seeding rates, as I said, based on a

758
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:35,439
target seeding rate for with germination

759
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,960
and seed size. So, we correct everything

760
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,720
uh to make sure we're putting out the

761
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,919
same number of seeds for for each uh

762
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,480
cultivar. So, as I mentioned, I think

763
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,559
that that uh seed lots have improved in

764
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,360
germination. The green bars represent

765
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:54,798
the germination for our seed lots that

766
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,479
we received last year for the uh for the

767
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:59,440
multi-state variety trial and you can

768
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,759
see a lot of these are are at 90% or

769
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,880
above. There's a few that are closer to

770
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,398
to 80 particularly for some of the newer

771
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,079
cultivars. Um but in my experience even

772
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,559
with tobacco it's not uncommon for a

773
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,720
newer cultivar to to have lower

774
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,639
germination rates while they're in the

775
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,439
process of trying to increase the the

776
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,679
seed for production. And then the purple

777
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,119
bars uh were those same seed lots that

778
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:27,358
we had stored for a year at 4C

779
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,039
um and four degrees C. And um looking at

780
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,039
germination and you can see for the most

781
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,119
part our germination is pretty well

782
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,440
preserved. Again, we had one seed lot

783
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,519
that looks like it it may have gone down

784
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,639
a little bit more than than

785
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:43,679
others. In addition to doing the

786
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,079
germination work, um Andrea is also uh

787
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,320
looking at we we've acquired a vibe seed

788
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,960
analyzer and among other things that

789
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,639
allows us to sort seeds based on um

790
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,358
various parameters. In this case, we're

791
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,760
sorting based on color. So we have brown

792
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:00,239
seeds, which are presumably uh seeds

793
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,839
that were mature at the time of harvest,

794
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,679
white seeds, which were approaching u

795
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:08,559
maturity, and green seeds, which we

796
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:10,159
presume to be relatively immature seeds.

797
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,599
And we've got them separated. She's got

798
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,838
them separated here just for the

799
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,079
purposes of of this picture to to show

800
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:20,719
the differences. But with this machine,

801
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:23,599
we can put a a you know a sample of seed

802
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,759
in there and it will come back and give

803
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,480
us the proportions of brown, white, and

804
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,800
green

805
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,400
seeds. Looking at seed sizes on those,

806
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,720
um you know, we've generally found that

807
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,240
the green seeds do tend to to weigh a

808
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:40,239
bit less, be a bit smaller. white seeds

809
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:41,759
uh sometimes are weigh less, sometimes

810
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,479
they're pretty similar to the brown

811
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,200
seeds in in

812
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,760
weight. And when she puts those in a in

813
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,519
a standard germination test, you know,

814
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,599
blue is so blue is our our original

815
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:58,480
seed. Um and we see from that, you know,

816
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,359
about 80% germination. Brown seeds

817
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,960
germinate at a higher rate. White seeds

818
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,598
kind of at a similar rate to the

819
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,400
original seed lot. And in some cases,

820
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,039
green seeds can be quite a bit lower uh

821
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,240
in in

822
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:14,320
germination. And so the you know the

823
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,838
overall germination rate of that seed

824
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,480
lot uh is

825
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:22,480
um depends on the on the proportion of

826
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,800
these lower germinating seeds that are

827
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,280
that are in there. But uh really

828
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,440
interested uh to to try to continue this

829
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,119
work. Um like I said, this is just

830
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,358
standard germination. We also want to

831
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,838
look at whether or not these green seeds

832
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:38,078
perhaps have lower viability as well.

833
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:41,279
So, not only may they germinate at a at

834
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,400
a lower rate, those that do germinate

835
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,560
potentially may have uh lower seedling

836
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:51,200
by uh vigor and not be able to establish

837
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:53,519
as well. So that's a an ongoing area of

838
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:56,879
research within our lab to to try to

839
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:59,320
better understand um the role of of seed

840
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,039
quality in in seed

841
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:06,480
vigor. Um uh Paul has also done some

842
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:09,519
work um looking at root vigor and root

843
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,519
growth in hemp plants. And he's done

844
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,960
this by growing uh growing hemp

845
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:17,519
seedlings in clear cylinders in a gel

846
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,039
material uh that's meant to simulate a

847
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:24,000
root growing environment or soil. But we

848
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:27,199
can come in and periodically

849
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,760
um take pictures uh of this. And then

850
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:33,598
Paul is using a u software to extract

851
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,280
information out about the root length

852
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,119
density uh rooting depth, root angles,

853
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,960
all kinds of information that we can

854
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,838
relate back then to the to the

855
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,838
performance of these uh varieties in

856
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:49,039
their establishment.

857
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:53,838
And so this is just an example over time

858
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:58,079
uh of the variety X59 at 6 days old, 9,

859
00:37:53,838 --> 00:38:00,480
13, 15, and 21 days. Um the same same

860
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,280
root system, how it's developed over

861
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,838
over time and rooting depth. And just an

862
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,400
example of of what we we're trying to do

863
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:12,400
with this, we took the the rooting depth

864
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,760
at 21 days and the population counts

865
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,960
that we had u from our field studies. So

866
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,320
this is a relative stand establishment

867
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,880
here. Um which basically is the stand

868
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:26,720
establishment percentage of the of the

869
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,039
cultivar compared to the average for

870
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,719
that year in trial because remember we

871
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,800
had a big difference in the in the in

872
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,480
the two different years there. So we

873
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,039
kind of had to correct for that. So this

874
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,440
is this is how each variety performed

875
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,679
relative to

876
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,240
uh the average of that particular trial

877
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:46,159
and and year. And we've correlated that

878
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,319
with the rooting depth that Paul

879
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:51,118
measured in the gel and we get a pretty

880
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,160
good positive correlation there. Um R

881
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,240
squared is not real high but point4. Um

882
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,119
and you know Paul's going to continue

883
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:59,639
with this work to

884
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:02,960
[Music]

885
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:04,879
um to to try to to relate more of these

886
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,320
rooting characteristics to the

887
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,640
performance that we're seeing in the

888
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,960
field and hopefully come out out of that

889
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:14,118
with some some breeding targets that we

890
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,800
might go after. um for

891
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:19,039
that. So I've talked a lot about trying

892
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,079
to reach the the target populations

893
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:24,159
which brings up the question of what is

894
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,000
the target population? What what should

895
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:29,679
we be shooting for? So this is a trial

896
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,039
that we did. This is with a variety

897
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,598
called Orion 33. It's a monicious type

898
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:38,960
uh of of

899
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:43,119
hemp. and we planted it at um target

900
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:46,199
seeding rates of 100,000 up to 1 million

901
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,400
seeds per acre in 100,000 seed

902
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:53,118
increments. And then again, this is our

903
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,200
our count of uh of plants at harvest.

904
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,119
We've got healthy plants in the blue and

905
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,879
then the gray represents what we call

906
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,800
diseased heads. Those that were showing

907
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,519
obvious symptoms of of um some sort of

908
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,960
of disease uh that was affecting that

909
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,800
that uh floral structure. And the

910
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,760
interesting thing, you know, I thought

911
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,519
we would have

912
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,200
um, you know, where we would would see

913
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:19,039
better establishment maybe at some of

914
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:20,960
the lower rates and less of the thinning

915
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,719
effect, but what we found was that

916
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,240
across all the planting rates, we

917
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:28,559
roughly got about 20 to 25% of the live

918
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:32,118
seed we planted turned into a

919
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:35,519
harvestable plant. So, you know, at

920
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:39,760
100,000 planted seeds, we got 20,000. at

921
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:41,000
a million planted seeds, we got 200,000

922
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,000
uh

923
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,039
seeds. Okay, so we didn't get anywhere

924
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,119
near our target, but surely this big

925
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,320
difference in population will make a

926
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,400
difference in grain

927
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:57,200
yield. At least that's what I

928
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,480
hypothesized would happen. Uh, but he

929
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:02,519
pimp is a very plastic plant and so even

930
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,960
at lower populations we got more

931
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:07,920
branching and we found that our grain

932
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,679
yields really didn't change that much

933
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,800
across all of those different

934
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:17,199
populations. So, similar thing we did in

935
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,440
2024. Um, you know, same sort of thing.

936
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:22,559
We only got about 20% of our plants. We

937
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,240
did increase up to 1.2 2 million uh

938
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,920
seeds per acre, but we still didn't

939
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:30,479
didn't get much over 200,000 plants per

940
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,240
acre at at harvest. And again, our

941
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,960
yields were a little more variable in

942
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:40,159
2024, but still no consistent pattern um

943
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,000
related to plant population. And you

944
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,799
know what we get at a lower population

945
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,960
as I said is fewer individuals but

946
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,200
highly branched versus single stalks uh

947
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,639
and and larger numbers of of single

948
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:58,439
stalks per uh per unit of

949
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:00,799
area. So you

950
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,280
know this doesn't mean the population

951
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,359
isn't important. We we still I think

952
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,319
need to achieve higher density

953
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:12,400
populations for some practical reasons

954
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:15,199
of harvest and um certainly for fiber we

955
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,880
need to be trying to to achieve you know

956
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:20,318
some of these higher higher plant

957
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,160
populations but um certainly we have

958
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:24,039
more work to do to understand what's

959
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:26,639
going on with our our

960
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:29,440
seeds. Mention our planting methods just

961
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:30,960
very briefly. Um when we started out we

962
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,599
were using the old planter in

963
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,079
conventional ground very heavily worked

964
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:41,359
tilled

965
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:43,839
soil. Um in 2020 and 2021 uh we did not

966
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:46,318
have good results with this method. So

967
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:48,639
beginning in 2022 we shifted to a no

968
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,559
tail planting in our system uh where we

969
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:53,598
were going into a wheat cover crop that

970
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,920
had been sprayed um to to kill that

971
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,160
down. We also went from a planting depth

972
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:04,079
of about uh a quarter

973
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:07,358
inch deep or um about three/4ers of a of

974
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:12,240
a centimeter. We went to uh to about uh

975
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:15,759
2 cm deep or or 3/4 of an inch um deep

976
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:17,279
in in this this planting method. And you

977
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,520
know, one of the reasons for that is

978
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,839
that with where we do the tillage and we

979
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,960
have that very fine seedbed, we had a

980
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:27,199
lot of issues with soil crusting and our

981
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:31,599
plants not being able to to break

982
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:34,960
through that that crust uh very easily.

983
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:38,160
Whereas with our noill system, um you

984
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,838
know, this was our 2024 stands here. you

985
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:41,838
know, we're we're getting better better

986
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,759
establishment out of that no till

987
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,599
system, although we still have, you

988
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,359
know, some rather large gaps in some of

989
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,559
our rows when we we're still not

990
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,838
achieving our our target population

991
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:55,279
goals even with

992
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:57,759
that. I'm going to just very briefly

993
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,440
mention um some work that we did with

994
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,680
planting dates uh trying to to establish

995
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,000
the impact of planting date and planting

996
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:08,159
depth uh with with two different

997
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,199
cultivars. Again, our our target

998
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:15,639
population in this case was

999
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:18,879
680,000 pure live seeds uh per acre.

1000
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:21,199
Um Tara uh Kaitton, who was my field

1001
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,720
manager at the time, uh kind of was was

1002
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,639
over a lot of this work. And you know,

1003
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:29,118
about the only consistent thing that we

1004
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:32,480
saw was that generally we did get better

1005
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:36,160
stands with with deeper planting. um the

1006
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,400
the planting date variable tended to to

1007
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:40,480
be more impacted by what happened

1008
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,039
immediately after that planting date. We

1009
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,199
didn't see a consistent trend from early

1010
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,119
to late with with planting date, but we

1011
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:50,559
did tend to see better results out of

1012
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:54,720
our our deeper planting. Uh same with

1013
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:57,358
our our 2022 um thing. We did see in

1014
00:44:54,719 --> 00:45:00,358
this trial the light green bar was was

1015
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:03,000
our populations at the end of

1016
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:06,239
establishment and the blue

1017
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,760
bars were at harvest. And so like we

1018
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,838
were seeing in a lot of our earlier

1019
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,400
studies, well a lot of our later studies

1020
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,920
as well, but um like we've seen in a lot

1021
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,760
of these studies, we're we're we're

1022
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,318
losing a lot of plants throughout the

1023
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:22,760
season um to to various losses there.

1024
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:25,199
grain yield um in

1025
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,640
2021. Very little impact of planting

1026
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:31,838
depth um at the early planting dates. As

1027
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:33,239
we got later, uh deeper planting date

1028
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,239
was was more

1029
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:38,479
advantageous. Then in 2022, it was kind

1030
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,559
of the opposite. In the early planting

1031
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,599
dates, we had an advantage for deeper

1032
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,400
planting um than we did in the in the

1033
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,318
middle dates. And then at the late date,

1034
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:52,400
again, an advantage for deeper planting.

1035
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:54,719
So overall, um, just quickly summarize

1036
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,639
the the yield results on this. You know,

1037
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:59,759
we did find that we tended to get better

1038
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:01,519
yields with deeper planting. So that's

1039
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,440
the the direction that we've moved in.

1040
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:06,559
We've now gone ahead and and even moved

1041
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,838
a little bit deeper. We're more uh like

1042
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:12,159
now between uh an inch deep, so about

1043
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:13,920
two to two and a half centimeters on

1044
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:18,239
average is is what we're shooting for

1045
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,720
now with our our planting uh depth.

1046
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:23,919
So just to kind of wrap up um there are

1047
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:28,318
some remaining challenges. Um we do have

1048
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:30,000
a a herbicide um sonin or ethyluralin is

1049
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:33,440
the active ingredient in that has

1050
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,119
recently been um labeled for use on

1051
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,280
hemp. We've used it the last couple of

1052
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:41,358
years in our variety trials. But there

1053
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:44,160
are certain weeds like the um uh yellow

1054
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:46,559
nuts edge uh that's in this picture that

1055
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,719
are not controlled by that. So, uh,

1056
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,000
there's still some some weed control

1057
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:53,439
issues that we're going to have to

1058
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,880
tackle, insect pests and diseases like

1059
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,400
fucerium head blight. Um, the most

1060
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,039
prevalent one that we have here in

1061
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,119
Kentucky. Uh, and the most prevalent

1062
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:06,400
insect pest that we've got on our grain

1063
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,880
uh grain crops, hemp crops is corn

1064
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,800
earworm. And this integrated pest

1065
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,000
management is something that uh

1066
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,480
Magdalina has been working on uh in my

1067
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,358
uh in my

1068
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:21,199
program. Some other challenges uh that

1069
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:23,199
we're we're facing and that I think our

1070
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,919
growers will be facing if we if we

1071
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:27,919
commercialize production in grain hemp

1072
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,519
um is when to harvest. You know,

1073
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:35,440
officially our target is at 50 to 75%

1074
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:37,719
brown seeds. Um but is this true across

1075
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,599
all locations? Is this true for all

1076
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:41,519
cultivars? You know, these are things

1077
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,240
that we need to to work out. Plus, it's

1078
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,000
just hard to know. You know, even when

1079
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:47,679
you're out there looking at them, it can

1080
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,280
be really difficult to assess when

1081
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:53,919
you're at this this point of 50 to 75%.

1082
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,680
If we harvest too early, we get a high

1083
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,599
too high of a proportion of immature

1084
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,598
seed. They're high moisture and cause

1085
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,000
problems for drying down. You know, if

1086
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:05,359
we're too late in harvesting, uh then

1087
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,920
we've lost seed. we we've had losses to

1088
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:10,559
to birds, you know, that continues to to

1089
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,280
be a problem as well. So, those are

1090
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,880
things to be worked out. Plus, you know,

1091
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,519
if we move to commercialization, we've

1092
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,000
got a lot of of logistics uh in harvest

1093
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:24,239
to work out. And and uh this is a

1094
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,239
picture from um 2023. I'm not sure why

1095
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:28,159
Paul Paul is smiling in this this

1096
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:31,039
picture because he's just climbed out of

1097
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,799
the back of that combine uh from about

1098
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,039
30 minutes of trying to clean out this

1099
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,880
massive water of fiber that was tangled

1100
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:40,400
up in our our um straw beater in there.

1101
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,079
And you know, this was a common

1102
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,519
occurrence. We'd have to do this several

1103
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:48,079
times a day uh to to clean out that that

1104
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:50,960
machine. And so, um, you know, this is

1105
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:54,160
this is definitely a challenge for, uh,

1106
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:57,679
moving forward with with grain hemp for

1107
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:58,960
us. Um, with that, uh, went I know I

1108
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:00,879
went through a few things a little bit

1109
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,599
fast there, but I'm going to stop at

1110
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,599
that point and see if we have any

1111
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,599
questions.

1112
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:11,838
Thank you,

1113
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:13,599
Bob. I might I might read the first

1114
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:16,799
questions. We have a couple minutes

1115
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:19,039
left. Yeah. Um, thank you for sharing

1116
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,519
and explaining, Bob. What do you think

1117
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:24,558
are the main factors for Kentucky not

1118
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:28,719
doing as well as, for example, New York,

1119
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:31,200
Vermont, or even Montana for grain and

1120
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:34,239
fiber? Is it the latitude versus the

1121
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:38,399
source of the seeds or is it moist

1122
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:40,239
moisture or rain or something else?

1123
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,519
Well, I think part of it we don't know.

1124
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:43,118
It's I don't believe it's the seeds

1125
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:45,039
because we're all using the same source

1126
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:49,440
of seeds in the in that multi-state

1127
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:53,920
trial. Um I I think the latitude has a

1128
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:57,280
lot to do with it. Um and you know maybe

1129
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,519
soil temperatures u playing something of

1130
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,040
a of a role in that. But that's that's

1131
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:04,880
something that I think we're we're

1132
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:08,639
striving to to try to figure out um a

1133
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,400
little bit better. Um, but I I think a

1134
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:13,358
lot of it does have to do with with just

1135
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,880
the the latitude. And if you look at,

1136
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,400
you know, a lot of the the early

1137
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,920
cultivars that we had,

1138
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,000
um, they came from they were developed

1139
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,559
at northern latitudes and then we're

1140
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,239
trying to adapt them to the south. Some

1141
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,240
of the the newer ones that we have

1142
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:31,358
coming along that have been adapted

1143
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:34,239
specifically for southern latitudes um,

1144
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:37,119
are are performing more consistently in

1145
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,118
our area.

1146
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,880
That is good to know. All right. So, the

1147
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:45,439
next question um is whether or not we

1148
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,400
evaluate uh fiber quality as part of the

1149
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,200
dual crop trials. Um we're not really

1150
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,519
looking at

1151
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:56,239
um you know specific fiber quality like

1152
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:58,239
the tensil strength or anything like

1153
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,759
that. About as far as we go with that,

1154
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:02,799
we we are doing uh a simple

1155
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:05,760
decordication. So, we're looking at the

1156
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,920
ratio of bass to herd. uh with that, but

1157
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:12,599
we're we're not uh we're not

1158
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:17,079
specifically looking at the at the fiber

1159
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:19,760
um fiber quality parameters right

1160
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:21,440
now. All right. Uh next question is in

1161
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,960
Kentucky, how many acres are being grown

1162
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,639
and how many farmers are growing the

1163
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,920
varieties that we're studying? Well, um,

1164
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:31,279
this year we're probably going to

1165
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,720
have I'm going to guess I haven't seen

1166
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,000
the numbers yet for sure, but we're

1167
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:37,039
probably going to have about five or six

1168
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,440
thousand acres grown in Kentucky. The

1169
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:42,400
vast majority of that is going to be

1170
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:45,039
canabonoid hemp still. Um, that market

1171
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:49,920
has come back a little bit in Kentucky.

1172
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:52,880
Um and so um there's only probably going

1173
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,760
to be less than well maybe about 100 to

1174
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,920
200 acres of fiber hemp that are grown.

1175
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,119
And yes, they are growing a variety that

1176
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:05,119
we have recommended from our our trials.

1177
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:08,079
Um and maybe 30 or 40 acres of grain

1178
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,920
hemp that I know of u in the state. So

1179
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,920
so most of what's being grown currently

1180
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:16,000
is not grain or or fiber, but we're

1181
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,000
working to to change that.

1182
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:23,919
Um say the please explain the

1183
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,559
differences between live seeds versus

1184
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,159
the total number of seeds and then seed

1185
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,880
quality with germination rate. For

1186
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:35,039
example, 66% germination rate is for all

1187
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:38,800
seeds. Yes. when we when so when when I

1188
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:40,759
say a 60% 66% germination rate that's

1189
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,680
basically taking the seed that we've

1190
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:46,040
received the whole sample out of the bag

1191
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:50,399
and testing it in a standard germination

1192
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:54,079
test. Um so that's of that's of all all

1193
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:56,400
the seed that that's there. And when we

1194
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,920
make that correction and we say we are

1195
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:02,079
planting

1196
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:05,200
um pure live seed, we're assuming that

1197
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:07,119
if it if it if we have germination in a

1198
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:11,759
standard germination test, then it is a

1199
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:14,318
live seed. Um, and so what we do then is

1200
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,400
is, you know, we we correct we we

1201
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,159
determine our total number of seeds per

1202
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,440
acre or plants per acre that we're

1203
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:25,838
targeting and then back calculate from

1204
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:28,720
that to to only plant uh live seeds. And

1205
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:31,519
then we also make an adjustment for the

1206
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:35,118
seed size uh because there's quite a

1207
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:38,280
range of seed size uh in in there and

1208
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:41,358
make an adjustment for that. And for a

1209
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:43,359
grower, um, as we move towards seed

1210
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:45,679
certification, that information will

1211
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:48,078
typically be on the on the seed tag that

1212
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:52,199
a grower can use, germination, and the

1213
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:55,359
and the the number of seeds per

1214
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:58,960
pound. Um, bird predation is another

1215
00:53:55,358 --> 00:54:00,960
major factor. Did Paul see any loss of

1216
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,358
seed due to bird predation? We should

1217
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,039
try some seed coatings. I agree. We we

1218
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:08,719
probably do need some seed coatings to

1219
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:12,079
deter um bird predation. Paul didn't

1220
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:14,239
specifically mention that. Um I will

1221
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,280
mention that with that old cedar that we

1222
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:19,759
had uh the the old red one that I that I

1223
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,359
showed um the first year we were doing

1224
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,200
it. I remember riding on that thing and

1225
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:25,039
and we had made a pass down the field

1226
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:27,759
with it and we were coming back up the

1227
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:30,400
next row and I looked over and there was

1228
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,559
a whole flock of morning doves on the

1229
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,519
plots that we had just planted and they

1230
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:37,519
were strangely walking in straight lines

1231
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,440
down the rows that that that we had

1232
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:42,559
planted. So, I agree. I think bird

1233
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:46,639
predation of seed is is potentially

1234
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:49,200
another another major issue.

1235
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:51,679
Um, what type of pre-emergent would you

1236
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,598
recommend for for fiber hemp? Well, the

1237
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:56,799
only one that that I know of that's

1238
00:54:53,599 --> 00:55:00,359
labeled is the the Sonolin uh which is

1239
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:03,039
ethylurelin from a company called Gowen.

1240
00:55:00,358 --> 00:55:05,920
Um, so that's that's the only one that's

1241
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:08,639
actually labeled. Um, we do use in our

1242
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:14,079
noail plantings, we are using glyphosate

1243
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:16,639
as a burndown. Um, and that's it's not

1244
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:20,000
technically labeled for that use yet.

1245
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:22,400
Um, but um, that is what we've we've

1246
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,400
been doing

1247
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:27,519
there. All

1248
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:30,880
right. What is the ideal pure live seed

1249
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:35,559
to plant for grain fine bast fiber herd

1250
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:38,480
production goals? I'm not

1251
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:42,720
sure Sarah what you mean by if you're

1252
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:45,838
asking about the uh uh what variety is

1253
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:48,078
best for each one of those or the the

1254
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:50,558
actual seed target numbers. If we're

1255
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,880
talking about seed target numbers, what

1256
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:56,079
we're currently planting for grain, uh,

1257
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,760
we're planting, uh, the 680,000 seeds

1258
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:00,640
per

1259
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:03,200
acre. And for fiber, we're shooting more

1260
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:06,000
for about a million seeds, pure live

1261
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:09,199
seeds per acre. Obviously, you see our

1262
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,880
results. We're not getting too close to

1263
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:15,358
too close to uh to that uh to those

1264
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:18,760
targets.

1265
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:21,838
Um follow-up question on the fiber

1266
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:24,160
quality. Do you know which university or

1267
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:27,920
research organization is looking at

1268
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:27,920
agronomic effects on fiber

1269
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:35,199
quality? I don't know. Um I think North

1270
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,559
Carolina State uh is doing some some

1271
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:42,239
work. They they have some

1272
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:44,798
u a some work going on with that. And uh

1273
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:47,679
I see James has just put into the to the

1274
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:51,039
chat there that uh the ARS unit in

1275
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:52,798
Louisiana uh is developing some some

1276
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:55,798
fiber standard or was going to be

1277
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:58,559
developing some fiber standards. But

1278
00:56:55,798 --> 00:57:01,400
um you know I I do think North Carolina

1279
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:04,079
is working with their textiles group as

1280
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:07,119
well. And James has indicated that they

1281
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:10,119
just sent some samples to the ARS in

1282
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,119
Louisiana.

1283
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:16,078
Um given that the grain yield does not

1284
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:18,239
change at different planting rates, what

1285
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,798
is the optimal planting rate for

1286
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:22,279
practical harvest with a combine

1287
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:25,280
avoiding the

1288
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:29,559
branchiness? Louise, I think we're still

1289
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:34,640
primarily at that 680,000

1290
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:36,480
um range. Um, so you know, I mean that

1291
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:38,960
if if we're planting that and getting a

1292
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,400
