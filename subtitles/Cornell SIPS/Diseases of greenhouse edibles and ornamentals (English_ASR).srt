1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,870
and it's hard enough to follow alan

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,859
Armitage but now I have to follow that

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:15,929
intro apologies everybody this was cool

6
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,160
thing that showed up on the web all

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,230
right they told me I was supposed to

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,000
talk about edible diseases well this is

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,990
edible flowers for starters there's our

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,079
cupcakes okay and I'm going to enjoy

11
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:30,089
taking you through some of the the

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,589
stories about edibles because that's

13
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:33,420
what I'm supposed to talk about it and

14
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,390
we'll see if all these little wires

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,579
start working oh cool okay because Betsy

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,948
and Neil who were putting the program

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,570
together asked me to talk about edibles

18
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:44,219
and I work on diseases so I'm going to

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,689
talk to you about edible diseases at

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,149
least at the beginning here for a little

21
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:50,338
while so here you have the first edible

22
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,890
disease some of you may have eaten this

23
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:55,829
one this is something we used to call

24
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,530
the sulfur shelf and it's bright orange

25
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,149
so my husband Robert will not touch it

26
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,850
because he says food should not be that

27
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,118
orange but it is quite delicious and

28
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,978
it's a very weak parasite of trees more

29
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,228
of a saprophyte but it can cause a week

30
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:12,328
rot of the tree and you'll get sort of a

31
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:13,858
brown heart rhyme in a tree so we can

32
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:15,779
never avenge on this particular disease

33
00:01:13,858 --> 00:01:18,868
by eating it so it's an edible disease

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,579
all right here's another one if you love

35
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:23,968
your turf you'll think of this as fairy

36
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:25,798
ring and that's a disease right you know

37
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,509
a fairy ring you might think of those as

38
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,759
places toads sit but it's better to

39
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,228
think about fairies dancing and however

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,989
you get close enough you can realize

41
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:36,030
that's also an edible disease because

42
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:38,188
you have chanterelles they're perfectly

43
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,019
edible perfectly wonderful and then

44
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:42,718
finally one that all the people who

45
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:46,228
watch trees perish in their landscapes

46
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:48,239
get to know our malaria melia which

47
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:51,060
causes our malaria root rot or the

48
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,629
shoestring root rot has an alter ego

49
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,670
it's known as the honey fungus because

50
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,978
it creates a mushroom when it fruits up

51
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,748
from the sick roots and we can eat that

52
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:03,989
mushroom it's a very delicious mushroom

53
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:05,728
with a Swedish kind of flavor to it so

54
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:09,750
here again you've got a plant disease

55
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:11,490
that is truly inedible but just one last

56
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,590
one because it's still before lunch you

57
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,239
think you can handle this we don't

58
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,979
always think of corn isn't ornamental

59
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,080
but there is an ornamental popcorn now

60
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:22,739
and back in

61
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:26,310
many years we've had a edible disease of

62
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,140
the corn plant how many of you ever seen

63
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,150
corn smut it's sort of a a very

64
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:33,479
interesting thing that will take the

65
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,450
kernels of the corn and turn them into

66
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,569
these big swollen white balls and those

67
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:41,219
balls are later on filled with white

68
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:44,340
smut spores because this is a smut

69
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:46,469
fungus and the amazing thing is that the

70
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,990
Mexicans in particular really value this

71
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:50,939
as an extremely valuable foodstuff and

72
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,760
when I got to travel down to Mexico

73
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,219
years ago we were able to get tacos that

74
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,319
had huitlacoche in there and it was very

75
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,520
exciting tastes like spinach a lot of a

76
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,129
lot of hype for something it tasted like

77
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,810
spinach but it's it's one of the

78
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:06,599
diseases we can have revenge on by

79
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,949
consuming them unfortunately this

80
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,840
doesn't apply to too many of our

81
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:12,569
ornamental plants and diseases are just

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,490
a pain but oh I wanted to know there is

83
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:18,239
a possibility for a little revenge on

84
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:21,270
the diseases that are ornamental these

85
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,480
the crops that I find growers getting

86
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,459
most aware of now Alan was absolutely

87
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,679
right when people say vegetables they

88
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,420
mean tomatoes and I think the greenhouse

89
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,219
growers who used to grow flowers all

90
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,049
understand that they're now growing

91
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:36,000
flowers + tomatoes if they're not

92
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,260
touching anything else and the other

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,870
thing they figured out quite a while ago

94
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,399
was that that also included herbs so

95
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,800
you'll see on my less basil and rosemary

96
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,180
because they are grown so widely by the

97
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,910
folks who used to think in terms of

98
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,219
geraniums and poinsettias and also

99
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:52,259
tomatoes peppers kale and the cucumber

100
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:54,389
and squash group the Q curve it's so

101
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:56,729
these are the topics I'll touch on today

102
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:58,469
and when we're doing a little disease

103
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,609
walk about this afternoon I can talk

104
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:01,769
about some of the other horrible

105
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,209
dreadful diseases like the ones that are

106
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,239
attacking begonias and attacking

107
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:08,810
impatience and what have you when it

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,039
comes to the diseases of edible crops

109
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,370
below ground it's pretty much all the

110
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,349
same as what you know the same fungi

111
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,540
things like Pythium and rhizoctonia and

112
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,459
phytophthora are going to be able to go

113
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,319
after the roots of your edibles just

114
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,019
like they go can go after the roots of

115
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,699
your flower crops the unfortunate thing

116
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,159
is you have a lot fewer things you can

117
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,629
do about them you can't put by the ban

118
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,090
rot to treat your edible play

119
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:34,680
so you need to be an even better grower

120
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:36,599
when you're producing the vegetables

121
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,090
because you need to have extremely good

122
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,680
sanitation so that you can pull these

123
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:43,079
crops through without using things

124
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,110
illegally and unsafely on the edible

125
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,209
crops here's another example

126
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,949
phytophthora on lavender a very common

127
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:51,689
disease problem because lavenders want

128
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:53,189
to be in a nice Mediterranean climate

129
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:54,360
and you put them in the greenhouse and

130
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:57,449
water them along with everything else

131
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,670
they get too wet so yes one problem is

132
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:02,069
the sanitation because the fight toppler

133
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,390
it can be there and pounce on them but

134
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,980
the more wetness you have the more

135
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:07,829
horrendous and epidemic you're going to

136
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,330
have in the greenhouse so let's start

137
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:11,479
out with basil I think this is the one

138
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:13,649
that drives the most people the craziest

139
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,170
here's a long list of the things that

140
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:18,269
can go wrong with basil will focus

141
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,160
mostly on the downy mildew because

142
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:21,959
that's certainly the ultimate problem on

143
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,090
that but you have an assortment of

144
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,759
difficulties for that crop potentially

145
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:29,399
you can have viruses like the insp and

146
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,289
the tswv up at the top you can have

147
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,259
various fungal problems like in track

148
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,210
noses or cercospora leaf spot you can

149
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:40,649
even have a systemic disease of fusarium

150
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:41,819
wilt disease root rot problems and then

151
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:43,889
in other parts of the world that even

152
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:45,599
have rusts and powdery mildews so if we

153
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:47,459
start importing basil from other places

154
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,530
we may get those diseases on top of the

155
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,569
ones that you have listed here upper

156
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:54,809
left there you'll see some modeling on

157
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:58,019
the foliage that's the look of tswv or I

158
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,600
nsv the two viruses are carried by

159
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:02,759
thrips that can affect basil I see this

160
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,500
a lot because the basil tends to be

161
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,750
grown right there along with the cutting

162
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,069
produced flowers and you're cutting

163
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,889
produce flowers are one of the ways

164
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:12,719
you're going to get tswv or I nsv going

165
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:14,879
in the greenhouse thrips can move it

166
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,650
from one plant to the next basil is one

167
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,969
of the susceptible plants so if that's

168
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:20,069
one of the many things you need to

169
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,380
protect your basil against and then at

170
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,899
the right is an image that I took up

171
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,310
here in Ithaca when I was visiting Neil

172
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,669
and I were doing some experiments with

173
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,040
basil and we got the fusarium wilt we

174
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,170
weren't expecting it but unfortunately

175
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,379
that particular disease is spread by

176
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:39,600
seed so again geez sometimes I think

177
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:41,939
these grafting ideas are good because if

178
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,740
we can get away from everyone working

179
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,050
with see the

180
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,759
has sort of unknown cleanliness we might

181
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,590
be able to get away from the possibility

182
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,860
of a fuse areum will obviously it can

183
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:53,779
kill the plan once in a rare while we'll

184
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,689
see an interac no sorcerer cost per leaf

185
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:58,638
spot when you see here and this is the

186
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:59,839
big one all right and this lighting it's

187
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,000
not too obvious but there's a little

188
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,709
yellowing on that basil and when you

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,598
turn the leap over you see a little dirt

190
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:07,638
on the underside it looks a little furry

191
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,550
and over the telephone people have told

192
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,500
me that looks like botrytis but they'll

193
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,819
mention that the leaf is still green so

194
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,050
that's the look of down emailed you

195
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,509
starting out on the underside of your

196
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,908
basil leaves we found last year when we

197
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:22,069
did some experiments with a slow release

198
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:24,019
fertilizer combined with a fungicide

199
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:25,400
that the more you fertilize the plant

200
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:27,469
the more impressive you can make the

201
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,598
down emailed you look you can get large

202
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,190
yellow window panes when the downy

203
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,259
mildew is going after basil under a high

204
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:35,959
fertilized situation and this is more

205
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:37,340
the field look okay a farmer initially

206
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,168
back when this was not a well-known

207
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:41,508
disease would look at this and think he

208
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:43,008
needed to add more nitrogen but it

209
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:44,389
certainly changed now to where people

210
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:47,629
are really watching all the time for

211
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:49,550
down yelled you to come in this is a

212
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:52,519
contrast here between the downy mildew

213
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,829
on the basil and the downy mildew on

214
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:57,019
coleus initially we thought they might

215
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:59,359
be the same organism but it turns that

216
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,859
they really aren't the same they look

217
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,479
the same under the microscope when they

218
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,280
make their spores the spores are pretty

219
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,899
much the same but this is a lesson

220
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,668
nitpicking here just for those of you

221
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:09,859
who think people at University shall

222
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:11,329
little geeky and worry about details the

223
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,830
way we can tell them apart is because

224
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:18,288
one of them is sort of a 1.2 four

225
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:20,300
lengths to breath ratio versus a 1.2

226
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:22,968
nine lengths to breath ratio and they

227
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,360
call this broadly ellipsoidal versus egg

228
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:28,250
shape now is that picayune or what so

229
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,870
they're really close in size but you can

230
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:33,229
measure the difference if you have a lot

231
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,060
of time and then even better yet now we

232
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,919
have DNA analysis where we can really

233
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,509
compare one organism to the other and

234
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:40,639
there are a lot of base pairs different

235
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:42,408
in those two organisms so you end up

236
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,990
with the coleus not really being named

237
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:48,169
yet and the the disease on the basil is

238
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,028
Perenara Bell berea so basically this is

239
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:52,039
important to you as a garden center or

240
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:54,139
whatever because you don't have to worry

241
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,778
about the downy mildew on your coleus

242
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:56,458
moving in

243
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:58,860
your basil and that's important because

244
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:02,099
we do have a coleus problem with a very

245
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,649
similar downy mildew getting back to the

246
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,870
basil this story is not terribly long

247
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,448
because we haven't had this disease in

248
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:12,749
the United States or in north america

249
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:14,849
until 2007 so it is new to us that's why

250
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:17,819
basil used to grow so well and now it

251
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,740
doesn't it's a new disease it's one of

252
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:21,599
these things that we run into because we

253
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,959
have global distribution of plants now

254
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,058
and it's been quite a problem since it

255
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,068
showed up in Florida in 2007 it was

256
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:30,509
about probably only about a year after

257
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,269
we started having trouble with the

258
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:35,129
coleus you get that furry growth of the

259
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,209
spores on the underside of the leaf and

260
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:37,949
this is what it looks like under the

261
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,479
microscope make sort of a little tree

262
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:41,039
and you get these little footballs

263
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,749
hanging from the ends of the branches

264
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,469
that you can only see with the

265
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:48,209
microscope the curious thing about this

266
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,910
disease is that it actually was known

267
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:55,528
first in Africa it was seen in a ganda

268
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:57,719
in 1933 and then people were not paying

269
00:09:55,528 --> 00:10:00,299
a whole lot of attention to it but there

270
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,399
was an outbreak in 1994 where it started

271
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,318
moving into Switzerland and then started

272
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,698
moving around Europe and it wasn't too

273
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:08,490
long after that that we saw it in

274
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:10,708
Florida so now it's a worldwide problem

275
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,659
all the little yellow spots show you

276
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,849
places where this disease has has

277
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:17,759
appeared now pretty much all the places

278
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,680
where anyone would ever grow basil one

279
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,740
curious slant is that it shows up in

280
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,958
microgreens also talk about a way to

281
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,278
devastate a crop there's a lot of yellow

282
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,289
modeling that shows when you have better

283
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:30,149
lighting on the image here at the left

284
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:32,159
and you can see the dirtiness on the

285
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:33,929
underside of the the cotyledons of those

286
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,938
little basil seedlings if you were a

287
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:37,229
microgreen producer you just have to

288
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:39,058
hang it up when you see this you're not

289
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,620
going to get your crop through it's

290
00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:42,000
impossible and then you can't really get

291
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,589
the other crops through that might be

292
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,839
just behind it you have to really clear

293
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,179
everything out and start over again once

294
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,860
the spores have died there really a

295
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:52,019
devastating problem and it's quite

296
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,409
obvious in this situation that you have

297
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,360
a seed boring problem okay it definitely

298
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:59,188
can get started from the seed so no

299
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,889
matter how early your plant has started

300
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:04,528
you might have a problem with it and

301
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:06,839
then a few years ago we had a company

302
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:08,070
that got interested in doing grafted

303
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,960
basil but

304
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,750
without proper respect for the downy

305
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,280
mildew and it became a problem in some

306
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,720
of the production these were great

307
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,289
plants how much did you sell these for

308
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,910
mark you didn't have those you're smart

309
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:23,009
and they were selling for you know

310
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:24,299
somewhere between 25 and fifty dollars

311
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:27,990
apiece this was in Greenwich Connecticut

312
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:30,179
I knew it was $25 or so a lot to sell a

313
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,129
basil plant for mind you but they did

314
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:33,959
also in some cases come with some downy

315
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:35,820
mildew so there's plants were complete

316
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,470
lawsuits so you paid a lot for your

317
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,260
initial grafted plant and then you could

318
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,940
not sell it later on so as we get into

319
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:43,500
these special new crops we really all

320
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,680
look for their Achilles heels and plan

321
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,659
for them meg McGrath who works in

322
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,889
vegetable plant pathology with me down

323
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:52,649
at the Long Island horticultural

324
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:53,939
research and Extension Center had put

325
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:56,399
together some interesting data

326
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,590
collection on the subject of basil downy

327
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,689
mildew by using the web to get people to

328
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,460
tell her what was happening where and so

329
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,620
she's got some interesting stats on it

330
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,750
we've known about the disease in New

331
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,279
York and Florida for now it'd be more

332
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,960
like 10 years because the slides a few

333
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,370
years old but you can see New York's

334
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,680
always at the epicenter of everything

335
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,950
and then here's some more look up here

336
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,659
74 reports New York up till 2014 that's

337
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,800
because we were going around given talks

338
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:21,959
about it and everybody was saying oh

339
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,669
yeah we've got it it's not really worse

340
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,440
in New York but don't for one moment

341
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:27,389
think that we don't have to deal with it

342
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,040
it's not a southern person's disease

343
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:31,110
it's it's a disease of the entire

344
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,969
industry and it's certainly disease of

345
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,399
the green s industry as well as the

346
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,500
outdoor industry so you as greenhouse

347
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,240
industry people want to make sure you're

348
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,830
not sharing that disease with farmers

349
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,970
and your vicinity any earlier than

350
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,330
they're going to have to cope with it

351
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:47,310
for other reasons there also is a real

352
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,759
global aspect to this it's it's showing

353
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:54,379
up in places you know Argentina is

354
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:58,559
having to fight basil downy mildew now

355
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:59,700
what the important effort on this is the

356
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,909
same one that we're going to see with

357
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:05,129
other diseases we've looked into the

358
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:07,439
types of basil and how susceptible they

359
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:09,990
are and there are now at least two major

360
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,550
breeding programs run at Rutgers and one

361
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,710
at the University of Florida where

362
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:15,269
they're looking to get us something

363
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,220
that's not as susceptible as the

364
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:18,929
standard awesome imbecilic amor however

365
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,490
that should be pronounced because your

366
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:22,109
basic Genovese basil is

367
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,009
highly susceptible to down emailed you

368
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,720
so they notice that if you had the

369
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:29,610
American own species that you would have

370
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,950
a much less highly susceptible plant so

371
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,470
their efforts to breed those genetics

372
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,240
into the plant that we're selling that

373
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,759
will ultimately become pesto or or a

374
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,250
caprese salad or what have you and there

375
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,889
has been some success along those lines

376
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,269
but we're not quite there yet at this

377
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:47,159
point some of you've probably grown the

378
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:48,958
eleonora which is a sweet basil that has

379
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,458
a little bit of resistance in it it's

380
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,588
not that it won't get the disease but it

381
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,299
will get a little slower so that's on

382
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:59,459
the market at the moment probably one of

383
00:13:54,299 --> 00:14:01,469
the better options there is a reason why

384
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:03,059
we're finding the seed transmission and

385
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,720
that's because the downy mildew makes a

386
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:08,099
special kind of spore that allows it to

387
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,980
reside within the seed make it through

388
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,860
that winter period and we know it's

389
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,110
there we could treat the seed to get rid

390
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,300
of the problem except for the fact that

391
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,970
basil seeds are really goopy when you

392
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:22,799
get them in hot water so there's only

393
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,620
one company in Europe at this point that

394
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,389
is treating seed to get rid of the downy

395
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,370
mildew and that they're using a steam

396
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:31,620
treatment method that somehow avoids the

397
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,419
glop eNOS so if you can get some of that

398
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,019
European heat-treated material out of

399
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:38,519
Germany then you'll be better off and

400
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:40,949
gloppy is not a botanical term but it

401
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:45,509
works great who didn't understand that

402
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:49,440
term will define worry and the the

403
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:51,328
amount of basil that gets basil seed

404
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,310
that has the problem is pretty high and

405
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:55,049
these are European figures here when

406
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,369
they did one survey they found that it

407
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:58,439
was virtually and everything and that

408
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,450
when you planted it out a pretty high

409
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,040
percentage of those seed we're going to

410
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,079
see lots we're going to give them

411
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,578
disease so if you've been feeling like

412
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,289
it's just you and there's something

413
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:09,719
really torturing you it's not there's

414
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:14,578
their seed contamination and it's very

415
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,500
hard to avoid it yes when the plant is

416
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:19,528
contaminated when that plan is being

417
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,720
grown as a seed parent there is

418
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:24,179
infection of the entire plant

419
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,528
systemically it's a systemic disease so

420
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:30,328
it can come from inside it survives

421
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:31,740
along the plants survive long enough to

422
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:33,088
produce seed right it would have to be a

423
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,899
later infection for just that reason

424
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,850
yeah

425
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,879
and then and then it gets inside and

426
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:43,149
stays inside as OS force yeah it's it's

427
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:45,220
too bad isn't yeah okay there's one

428
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:47,199
really interesting little thing which

429
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,970
I'm hoping this industry can be clever

430
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,040
enough to capitalize on some of the

431
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,500
research and Israel has shown that light

432
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,329
really impedes the spore production of

433
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,159
the basil down emailed you it doesn't

434
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,530
stop infection I wish it stopped

435
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:01,029
infection that would be even better but

436
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,939
if you can keep the leaves directly in

437
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:05,889
contact with light you can stop spore

438
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,360
production that's really stops your

439
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:09,399
epidemic or at least slows it down a

440
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,220
great deal so they've done things they

441
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,449
produce their basil in fields at and in

442
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,460
the night they're just stringing lights

443
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:18,160
over them and providing light and

444
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,139
they're getting something like 18 days a

445
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,669
product protection on a plant the

446
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:23,049
thicker the canopy gets the more you

447
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:24,909
have parts of the plant that aren't

448
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,769
directly exposed to the light so your

449
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:28,240
effectiveness goes down but if you're

450
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:30,100
growing something like microgreens you

451
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,139
could really make use of light and this

452
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,850
will illustrate the idea for you there's

453
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:36,819
blue things on the left or test tube

454
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:39,490
caps and after these plants were sprayed

455
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:43,390
with sporangia of downy mildew the test

456
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:45,759
tube camps were placed on and then given

457
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:47,169
a little time all right and the only

458
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,509
places where you got spore production

459
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:51,339
three days later we're over at the right

460
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,980
where you see the darkness the places

461
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,560
where the test tubes kept the light off

462
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,600
okay really nifty and you know you can

463
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,979
you can use this to your betterment

464
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,720
whether you can make it go away

465
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,329
completely that way I would doubt but

466
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,799
you could probably make things better by

467
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,079
supplying light during your basal

468
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:09,759
production so these are the kind of

469
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,019
things you want to think about if you're

470
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,129
trying to get basil through without

471
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:17,950
downy mildew if you can buy clean seed

472
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,300
that has been treated with steam try to

473
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,830
go with your less susceptible varieties

474
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:22,809
and this will be getting better all the

475
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:24,909
time I think in four years or so we'll

476
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:27,789
have plants we can buy that won't get

477
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,050
this disease anymore check if you're

478
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:31,389
bringing in transplants look them over

479
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,889
really hard if you see any yellow me on

480
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,020
the leaves put them in a plastic bag

481
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,460
with a wet paper towel overnight and see

482
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:37,599
if they're furry underneath the next

483
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,690
morning you can look for the downy

484
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,490
mildew do a lot of scouting and you can

485
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,640
apply treatments and you do need to

486
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,430
apply treatments the phosphorus acids

487
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,930
rivas and ran manner

488
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,450
options for chemical control in the

489
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,070
greenhouse keep your humidity down play

490
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,960
with the light experimentally see what

491
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:55,460
you can do with that and if you have a

492
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,019
problem just get rid of everything and

493
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,269
then start over again that's really all

494
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:01,220
you can do we're also suggesting that

495
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:03,200
you try to grow basil earlier in the

496
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,970
season because the further you get into

497
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,100
summer the more likely you are to run

498
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,690
into some sort of inoculum coming in

499
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:10,879
from outside the greenhouse getting into

500
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,070
your production so early your production

501
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,450
is safer than later production but even

502
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:16,490
early production you might get in

503
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:19,539
trouble because of seed transmission not

504
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:21,529
all seeds contaminated but some is um

505
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:23,180
okay I mentioned these here your

506
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:25,609
products that are phosphorous assets on

507
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,259
the top row just some examples of ones

508
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:29,949
that are labeled for use on basil things

509
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:32,690
like k fight or phosphate or Rambert

510
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:35,600
they're in a group that's called the

511
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,900
frack group 33 that have phosphorous

512
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,250
acid as their active ingredient and

513
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,320
revis and ran man are the things people

514
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,420
would be using on outdoor crops but they

515
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,149
have labels that do not prohibit using

516
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,940
green ounces so that's an option for you

517
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:52,460
too it's perfectly okay to use that

518
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,930
group 33 over and over again if you want

519
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,120
to it's not prone to resistance

520
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,350
development and most growers are doing

521
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:02,000
that but it's only going to last for

522
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:04,429
about a week okay next plant rosemary um

523
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,380
it's a plant without a lot of problems

524
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:09,019
but it has a few and my job is to tell

525
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,550
you what they are primarily you're going

526
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:12,799
to have to battle powdery mildew on

527
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,990
rosemary and this last year was a bad

528
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,629
year for powdery mildew on rosemary it

529
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,039
was in the trade for whatever reason so

530
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,540
many of you discovered it for the first

531
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,559
time and we're wondering why your plants

532
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:23,240
look white when you were supposed to

533
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:24,679
look green they're supposed to have a

534
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,799
little bit of a waxy bloom but not that

535
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,799
much waxy bloom you get this kind of a

536
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,970
look okay looks like it's been dusted

537
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:34,069
ideally you should be scouting for this

538
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,720
and the minute you see any of it really

539
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:37,129
go right in there and start a program

540
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,259
where you're working with something that

541
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,580
will stop powder and noting because once

542
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:42,200
it begins in the greenhouse you have

543
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,490
high enough humidity that it's going to

544
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,640
keep happening in the greenhouse all

545
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:49,339
season long this is a similar-looking

546
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,740
plant but it looks worse this particular

547
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:53,929
case is down email to you and I've only

548
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,519
seen this once but because we're having

549
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,110
such a bad time with down emailed users

550
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,789
on so many other plants I just want to

551
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:59,548
warn you about it so if you see

552
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:01,378
something that

553
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:03,829
is making the plants look really unhappy

554
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:06,178
but you don't see the powdery mildew on

555
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:07,439
keep this in mind is one possible

556
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,999
explanation you can just throw it away

557
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,070
if you see it it's hopefully not going

558
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,690
to be a big deal for powdery mildew

559
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:14,819
maintenance which is a more standard

560
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,389
thing this experiment might give you a

561
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:19,589
few ideas we work with ultra fine oil

562
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:22,109
now you would probably be using some oil

563
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:24,599
X and we work with Mills stop and cease

564
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:25,949
and we tried them alone and you can see

565
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,109
that the mills stop and the oil work

566
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,840
most powerfully to reduce the powdery

567
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:32,069
mildew we also tried alternations which

568
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:33,959
is much more of what you would be likely

569
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:35,579
to do in the greenhouse and by using

570
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,528
three of those ingredients together or

571
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:40,138
alternating two of them it worked really

572
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:41,759
easily so probably mill stop with one of

573
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,498
the others would be your best program to

574
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,220
use to keep your powder email you

575
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:48,960
managed on rosemary and the greenness

576
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,909
tomato diseases okay this is the one

577
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,079
vegetable and this is the main one I

578
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:56,100
really want to speak to you about

579
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,569
because homeowners all want this but not

580
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:59,368
all of you are used to growing

581
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:01,138
vegetables you started out in the flower

582
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:02,668
industry in many cases so you don't know

583
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:04,618
the standard things that any tomato

584
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:07,440
grower would know and you need to know

585
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:09,329
these things the disease there that's at

586
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,179
the end of the list by top there infest

587
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:13,888
hands is a scary disease it brought us

588
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:15,509
all the Irish over from Ireland because

589
00:21:13,888 --> 00:21:17,219
they were starving to death because of

590
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:19,618
the effects of that disease on the

591
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,210
potato crop and then somewhere along the

592
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:24,089
lines the organism learned to switch

593
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,499
over and also attack tomatoes so now we

594
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:27,599
have something that's a really serious

595
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:29,249
disease that we might end up harboring

596
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,408
in our greenhouse industry and we don't

597
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:32,879
want to be doing that and then there are

598
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:34,528
a few other things there that are every

599
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:36,748
day for a farmer that you might not know

600
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:39,960
about one of the ones you do know about

601
00:21:36,749 --> 00:21:41,819
is this a couple years ago just your

602
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,879
season before this we had a real scare

603
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:47,368
about tmb tobacco mosaic virus on

604
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:48,808
between us and the greenhouse and if you

605
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:50,128
carry the crop all the way through you

606
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,499
might see symptoms like these where you

607
00:21:50,128 --> 00:21:55,709
get a verra Gatien or modeling in the

608
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:58,889
flowers of the plant early season many

609
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:01,590
growers also saw strap-like leaves or

610
00:21:58,888 --> 00:22:04,618
stunting or dead leaves because of the

611
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:06,628
effects of tmv on petunia that comes

612
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:09,148
from an error up at the source of your

613
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:11,069
cuttings and the company that had that

614
00:22:09,148 --> 00:22:12,518
problem worked bent over backwards to

615
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:14,829
clean it all up and have a good year

616
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:17,409
this year and it worked so I'm glad to

617
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:20,708
see that extra sanitation will defend us

618
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:23,769
against this problem but many people did

619
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:25,899
learn that it was scary because they

620
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:28,388
learned that petunias could be a source

621
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:31,208
of trouble for tomatoes in particular

622
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:32,498
and it also has a huge host range the

623
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:33,788
biggest danger would be heirloom

624
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:36,098
tomatoes because they don't have any

625
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:38,588
natural resistance built into them so if

626
00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:39,759
you're growing petunias particularly if

627
00:22:38,588 --> 00:22:42,700
you're bringing them in as cuttings from

628
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,378
offshore I really try to keep your

629
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,328
tomatoes away from them that's one of

630
00:22:44,378 --> 00:22:47,528
the smartest things you can do this is

631
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:49,298
the kind of thing you can do to a tomato

632
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:50,588
fruit it's not pretty you can do a lot

633
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:53,440
of other ugly things you might not even

634
00:22:50,588 --> 00:22:56,138
get to fruit we learned that nonfat dry

635
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,179
milk is one of our most useful control

636
00:22:56,138 --> 00:23:00,338
materials when you're dealing with tmv

637
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:02,709
and the green is so if you do find that

638
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:05,858
you have it respond with an excellent

639
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:09,729
sanitation disposal and a lot of use of

640
00:23:05,858 --> 00:23:11,468
dried milk solution okay back to your

641
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:13,808
leaf spots one of the many things that

642
00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:15,278
we have to worry about on tomatoes we've

643
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:17,078
seen this you know seven or eight times

644
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:18,608
this year down on Long Island it's a

645
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:21,668
pretty common disease on tomatoes you

646
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:23,828
probably all have it at home not easy to

647
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:26,528
tell which one is which but there are

648
00:23:23,828 --> 00:23:28,749
three bacterial leaf problems that can

649
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:30,190
occur in tomatoes bacterial spots the

650
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:32,288
most common which is a xanthomonas

651
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,989
bacterium but there's also bacterial

652
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:36,878
canker and bacterial spec and there's a

653
00:23:34,989 --> 00:23:38,019
fungal leaf spot that you're probably

654
00:23:36,878 --> 00:23:39,939
not going to be able to tell the

655
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:41,259
difference from which is the one here at

656
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,190
the lower right that's a septoria leaf

657
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:47,108
spot it's also pretty common on tomato

658
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,479
to work against that the farmers have

659
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:50,648
learned to use treated seed I don't know

660
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:52,389
that you folks are always getting

661
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:54,548
treated see but maybe you want to look

662
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:56,398
into that because hot water treatment

663
00:23:54,548 --> 00:24:00,519
will eliminate some of these problems

664
00:23:56,398 --> 00:24:04,148
you can use copper and agri meissen type

665
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:06,338
fungicides on tomato and pepper in the

666
00:24:04,148 --> 00:24:07,958
greenhouse but not necessarily on any of

667
00:24:06,338 --> 00:24:11,019
your other crops because they're labeled

668
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:13,089
for specific vegetables you want to

669
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:14,649
reduce your leaf wetness and splashing

670
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:17,200
because that can move bacteria from

671
00:24:14,648 --> 00:24:18,878
place to place and really inspect your

672
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,159
plants and throw away problems while

673
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:22,898
they're still small you may not want to

674
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,549
do a lot of treatment but just an

675
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:25,689
occasional copper maintenance spray may

676
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:27,190
help you stay I

677
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:31,240
of a big problem with this kind of leaf

678
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:33,250
spawning another spotter on tomato is

679
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,839
tomato spotted wilt virus you heard a

680
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,548
lot about this virus as ornamental

681
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:38,199
producers before you ever grew a tomato

682
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:39,970
but there's a reason why it's called

683
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,090
tomato spotted wilt it can make spots on

684
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,950
tomato alright and it looks a little

685
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:46,509
different each time just as it looks

686
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,889
different on each of your flower crops

687
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:50,649
it can look different on each tomato

688
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:52,418
cultivars that you might grow and it can

689
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:53,829
be ugly so it's another one of the

690
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:56,769
things you don't want to get into your

691
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:58,750
vegetable crops this virus isn't on seed

692
00:24:56,769 --> 00:25:01,960
so if you can keep your cutting grown

693
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:04,089
crops and your thrips away from tomatoes

694
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,919
that you're producing from seed that'll

695
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:07,750
do a great deal of good to keeping

696
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,330
tensed up you be away from them you get

697
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,849
fruit symptoms as well as spots when you

698
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:14,168
have tswv in tomatoes and one of the

699
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:16,689
things that helps you identify it are

700
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:19,210
these blackish streaks that are down the

701
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:22,389
middle of the leaf there that's quite

702
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,829
typical of tswv on a tomato and then

703
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:26,048
really ugly things can happen to the

704
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:30,308
tomatoes your customers won't like TSW

705
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:32,200
be on their tomatoes keeping the flowers

706
00:25:30,308 --> 00:25:34,298
and the vegetables apart would be great

707
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,580
for this it's not possible for some of

708
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:38,440
you but it's a goal alright I think it

709
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:40,778
will help our future production because

710
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,419
we don't like being in a situation where

711
00:25:40,778 --> 00:25:45,398
we have for example a material that you

712
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:46,960
can spray on one plant but it's illegal

713
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:49,000
to spray on the one beside it it's not a

714
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,319
good situation to be in so I think

715
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,690
keeping things separate will really help

716
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,859
us in the future and definitely watching

717
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,288
them and knowing what the symptoms are

718
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:58,658
so that you can pick up on them just as

719
00:25:56,288 --> 00:26:01,569
they're starting up and then finally the

720
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:03,580
late blight late bite will cause large

721
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:05,710
debt areas in the leaves and it can look

722
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:07,509
a lot like botrytis we work with a

723
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,069
grower a couple years ago who was

724
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:10,720
treating for botrytis because he thought

725
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:12,808
he had botrytis and his tomatoes because

726
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,220
he was a flower grower he knew botrytis

727
00:26:12,808 --> 00:26:17,470
but he didn't know about late blight

728
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,629
which causes large lesions with maybe a

729
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,370
pale rim around them and then it can

730
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:22,509
also cause stem lesions hopefully you

731
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:24,518
can make out these are a little bit

732
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:26,349
frosty and that's because you get a lot

733
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,899
of the sporangia produced on the surface

734
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:30,969
it's almost like a down emailed you the

735
00:26:28,898 --> 00:26:33,969
fight topler infestans that causes this

736
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:36,100
late blight disease is truly genetically

737
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:38,870
very similar to a downy mildew and it's

738
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:41,029
airborne so it can move great distances

739
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:43,189
and it's really a pernicious threat this

740
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:45,500
is kind of thing it does to a tomato all

741
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:47,480
right not a good thing all right and it

742
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,390
can do this to a tomato also not a good

743
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,089
thing we do know it can go to petunias

744
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:54,890
it's very rare that goes to petunias but

745
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:57,019
this is one of Margo bechtel slides who

746
00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:00,050
got her PhD here at Cornell a number of

747
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:02,029
years ago she caused this particular

748
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:03,529
infection but this is a picture from a

749
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:05,329
box that was shipped into me sometime

750
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:08,269
that incubated on route got real fuzzy

751
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:10,970
on the way you really can occasionally

752
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:12,529
have that disease in petunia so watch

753
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,779
for that let me know if you see anything

754
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:17,928
remotely like it this is a picture from

755
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:19,490
the botrytis like late light infection

756
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:20,960
that occurred a couple of years ago we

757
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,370
still have no idea what the source was

758
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,410
and we're thinking it might have been

759
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:26,209
some solanaceous ornamental light of

760
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,070
Central America that was growing in the

761
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,019
same greenhouse we have no idea the

762
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:32,509
strain was tested here at Cornell and we

763
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:33,799
know it's not the standard strains this

764
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:35,690
is a listing that you don't need to pay

765
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:39,049
a whole lot of attention to other than

766
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:41,210
to see that the string called us 23 is

767
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:43,609
sensitive to methanol sim which is in

768
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:45,558
subdue max and that one affects potato

769
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:47,359
and tomato and it's the dominant one

770
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:49,670
that we've been seeing in New York for

771
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,500
the past several years good in some ways

772
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,450
bad and others and this is one of meg's

773
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,549
maps that gives you a sense if you

774
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,769
follow the dates of how the late blight

775
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:59,299
disease would ordinarily start down in

776
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:01,429
Florida and move its way up the coast

777
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:04,279
and get to us late which is why it's

778
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:05,900
called late blight but guess what our

779
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:08,899
greenhouse industry ships plants all

780
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:11,120
over creation so in 2009 there was

781
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,070
enough shipping of contaminated tomatoes

782
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,449
from the south that got all over the

783
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:16,909
Northeast and it was a really early

784
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,679
epidemic problem for all the farmers in

785
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,179
the Northeast so we don't want to be

786
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:21,830
part of that we need to inspect our

787
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:25,040
crops to make sure we're not moving late

788
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:27,710
blight around this repeats everything I

789
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,299
just said I think definitely watch for

790
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,610
this one it's not going to be common but

791
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:33,470
it's bad if you get it and I wanted to

792
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:36,229
give you some hope here there's

793
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:39,230
information now on some cultivars that

794
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:41,000
are resistant to late blight and as an

795
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,339
industry particularly if you're a garden

796
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,200
center you can really help people by

797
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:47,569
offering and promoting the late blight

798
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,640
resistant cultivars so here we're going

799
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:52,049
to have the same control at the right

800
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,390
hand side for each of these images now

801
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:56,970
fresh plus obviously is susceptible to

802
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,350
the disease it's blighted right over at

803
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,660
the left you see Mountain merit which

804
00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:02,009
looks pretty good and up at the top it's

805
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,830
got a little notation there it tells you

806
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:06,990
it as two different genes for resistance

807
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:09,839
but if we go to Iron Lady nice name huh

808
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:12,480
looks good the mountain fresh plus of

809
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,980
course looks really dead and here you

810
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,839
have mountain magic which is probably

811
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,480
gotten the most promotion has anybody

812
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,519
sold mountain magic good it's good to

813
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,329
see the hands all right good good idea

814
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:27,569
and here we got Jasper Jespers a cherry

815
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:29,579
tomato and really very very good

816
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:31,289
resistance that's what the tomatoes look

817
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:33,210
like at the upper right that's Meg's

818
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:35,250
husband and Sandy menasha our vegetable

819
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,079
agent down to the right Jasper's are

820
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,269
really high performing cherry tomato

821
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,250
resistant to the late blight and this

822
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:43,829
information is all on the web meg has an

823
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:46,230
excellent website that you can get to

824
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:50,039
that's a vegetable md site that said

825
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:51,960
Cornell the resistance is coming from a

826
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:54,839
wild relative of the tomato this

827
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,220
selenium Pepin Ella folium is where

828
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:58,199
there's genes are coming from and thank

829
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,150
goodness for them because that will with

830
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,880
time breathe is out of this problem make

831
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:05,940
everything wonderful again I have a nap

832
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,190
too meg and I work together on one with

833
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,320
the plant pathology society that's

834
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,539
available it's the notes are in your

835
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,269
handout sheet if you look under either

836
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:18,659
plant health or tomato md with a space

837
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:21,359
between tomato and md it's not as pretty

838
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,650
sound zap I'm sorry it has all sick

839
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,299
plants in it I don't think there's a

840
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,880
single healthy plant in the entire app

841
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:28,109
but if you want to have one for

842
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,730
reference when you're talking to

843
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:32,669
gardeners at your garden center or you

844
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,230
have tomatoes at home it has 350 or so

845
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:37,610
pictures of sick tomatoes in it that's

846
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,610
pretty cool right yes

847
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:46,130
yes that's a very good question it's

848
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:48,470
very true unfortunately certain ones

849
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,230
that are selenium okay we'll definitely

850
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,900
Harbor late light the biggest Harbor is

851
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:56,630
however potato because you'll get potato

852
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,430
volunteers you know the next year it

853
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:01,310
doesn't over winter and tomato per se

854
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:02,779
but potato is a very bad carryover so if

855
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:04,730
you alternate between potato and tomato

856
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:07,220
and your fields and you have potatoes

857
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,839
coming up coming up among the tomatoes

858
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,120
the disease will come right along with

859
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:14,869
it and you know weed control doesn't

860
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:17,509
hurt either absolutely okay just a

861
00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:19,669
couple things on pepper the ornamental

862
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:22,039
pepper is prone to bacterial leaf spots

863
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:24,110
and also the non ornamental pepper is

864
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:26,440
from to bacterial leaf spots so again

865
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:30,799
copper might be useful to you there

866
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,240
we've also seen I nsv on peppers and all

867
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,799
sorts of interesting different spots

868
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,079
pale spots brown spots the insp really

869
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,759
moves in on those and then even a zigzag

870
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:42,289
line you might see that symptom this

871
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:44,509
could only be caused by virus there's

872
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:47,659
nothing else that can give you that kind

873
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:50,000
of a pattern in a plant and one other

874
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:52,220
whole disease curiosity that you might

875
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,930
be aware of and might not the powdery

876
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,569
mildew we're used to seeing on verbenas

877
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:59,690
also goes to cucurbits so if you're

878
00:31:56,569 --> 00:32:01,309
growing verbenas is flowers and also hey

879
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,960
new one this year we started having a

880
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:05,929
lot of trouble with caliber colas with

881
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,000
powdery mildew that's also the same one

882
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:10,549
so you can have movement from the curb

883
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,470
it back and forth to the verbena and

884
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:14,149
it's good to know those are good things

885
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:16,460
to keep apart and be aware of that if

886
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:19,040
you've seen pumpkins looking white in

887
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,170
the fall that's from powdery mildew it's

888
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,759
very damaging to the fruits and tends to

889
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,590
create sun-scorched when they've got the

890
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:26,210
powdery mildew but those spores can grow

891
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:27,859
and blow into the greenhouse if you were

892
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,269
thinking of keeping verbena over and

893
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:31,639
then you can keep the powdery mildew

894
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:33,950
over on the verbena and I wouldn't say

895
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,330
this except I've seen people do it so

896
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,559
they'll keep verbena in the back and

897
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,759
then they wonder why they're zucchini

898
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,740
you're looking funny the next spring

899
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,569
well this is why they manage to keep the

900
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,370
inoculum over and we will see the same

901
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:45,639
disease on petunias particularly in the

902
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:48,109
field in the at the end of the year

903
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,480
there is a lot of variation from one

904
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:52,669
verbena to the next and that problem has

905
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,339
gone way down the industry really got

906
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,080
rid of the cult

907
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,129
hours that were highly susceptible so I

908
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:58,169
don't think it's a common problem

909
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:00,420
anymore but maybe the caliber coma

910
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:02,039
problem is on the way up so watch them

911
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,810
and keep the powdery mildew under

912
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:05,789
control because you don't want to cause

913
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:07,559
the farmers in your area to have extra

914
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:09,210
trouble with early epidemics because

915
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:12,599
you're growing that same disease on your

916
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:14,460
flower crops bacterial things are

917
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:17,819
bothering air kale and ornamental

918
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:19,799
cabbage growers now and and the the

919
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:21,059
farmers know this disease you might not

920
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,279
if you're coming in from the ornamental

921
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:25,349
side of things here's an ornamental kale

922
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,759
with yellow wedges and the leaves

923
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:29,429
starting on the lower leaves and

924
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:31,890
climbing up the plant the disease is

925
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:33,810
called black rot and it's a xanthomonas

926
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:37,320
not the same one that goes to geraniums

927
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:40,109
it's just a cousin and its seed born aha

928
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:42,419
another problem and as the the kale got

929
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:43,889
more popular the past few years I think

930
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,300
it lowered the seed quality because

931
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:47,070
everybody was scrambling to get enough

932
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,409
seed so particularly the red boar

933
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:52,169
cultivar of kale has been a real problem

934
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:54,090
for our growers in recent years it is a

935
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,980
systemic disease so you can see in a

936
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:57,750
cross-section of the stem little black

937
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,269
areas where the vascular system is

938
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,890
infected and you can put under the

939
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:03,690
microscope and over at the right maybe

940
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,400
you can envision there's a pulsing out

941
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:09,389
of lots of little bacterial cells in

942
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:11,369
water from a cut vein really an easily

943
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:13,049
spread disease so it's good for you to

944
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:15,329
be aware of it so that you will be able

945
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:17,010
to recognize it and rogue out the plants

946
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:19,440
that have that problem and go on to grow

947
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:22,770
the rest with the help of some copper

948
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,780
sprays these things are all handleable

949
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:26,400
if you're not ignorant of them so just

950
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,019
being aware of what the problems are

951
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,579
that can affect your edible crops that

952
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:31,380
you're growing in the green s will help

953
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:34,409
you a great deal and hopefully

954
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,809
everything can just be hunky-dory in

955
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:38,849
your production I don't want to take any

956
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:40,139
questions just because of our time

957
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:42,000
situation because one should have a

958
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,319
break but thanks for your attention and

959
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,610
you'll all have a chance to ask me

960
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,720
questions this afternoon when we're

961
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,720
going around thanks

962
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:57,559
this has been a production of Cornell
