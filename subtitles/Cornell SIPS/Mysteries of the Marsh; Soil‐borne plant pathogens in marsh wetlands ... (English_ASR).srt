1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,439
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,439
university

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,559
uh thanks for coming can you hear me can

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,599
the people in the back hear me okay

5
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:14,558
great

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,800
um

7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:19,439
so as eric mentioned today i'll be

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,679
talking about my dissertation research

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,160
and focused on this topic of the

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,879
mysteries of the marsh looking at soil

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,960
borne plant pathogens and marsh wetlands

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,640
and their impact on invasive and native

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,160
plant species

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,840
and

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,519
through my dissertation research i've

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,079
been really trying to answer the

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,719
question of whether soil pathogens are

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,558
contributing to the success of invasive

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,480
plants and marsh wetlands

20
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,718
and a lot of the work that i've done is

21
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,038
displaying the groundwork to answer this

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,160
question so today's seminar i'm going to

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,399
be focusing on presenting to you

24
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,799
a few experiments that are answering

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,759
questions i think really enable us to

26
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:02,718
start to answer that question and that

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,359
is do invasive plants change soil in a

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,439
way that decreases seedling survival and

29
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,000
if so how

30
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,359
which omi seeds and fungi are present in

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,079
marshwell and soils and are these omi

32
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:20,400
seeds and fungi pathogens of marsh

33
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,400
plants and if so how virulent are they

34
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,640
so in this picture you can see two

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
fields right here where i work at the

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,400
north end of cayuga lake in the

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,759
mountains in the wetlands complex here

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,079
on the left you have something that

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,439
perhaps is a little more familiar to

40
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,519
those of us in this room and in this

41
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,679
department this is a wheat field and on

42
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,359
the right this is a marsh wetland so you

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,560
can see a lot of differences right off

44
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:45,359
the bat between these two areas but

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,799
i think the biggest difference and kind

46
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,519
of relatively the biggest difference

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,118
between agricultural areas

48
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,319
which are highly managed and less

49
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,920
managed more natural areas is diversity

50
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,000
so this diversity

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,920
is both the richness and evenness of

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,399
species so the richness being the number

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,478
of species that are there their evenness

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,040
being their abundance relative to each

55
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,280
other and it also happens on both a

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,760
genotypic and a spatial scale so if you

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,479
think of in this cornfield there's

58
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,479
probably just one genotype there one

59
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,598
species but also one genotype here

60
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,359
you're going to have a lot of different

61
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,679
species a lot of different phenotypes

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,879
within each species and the spatial

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,040
heterogeneity is much larger

64
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,759
so

65
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,719
one exception to the rule that natural

66
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:35,598
areas tend to be really highly diverse

67
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,519
are invasive plants and

68
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,598
by invasive plants i mean that these are

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,080
non-native plant species so they've

70
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,878
evolved somewhere else they've come to a

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,239
new place they're rapidly expanding

72
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,639
their range

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,840
and for the most part they have some

74
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,238
negative consequence either on humans

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,519
economically or on some ecosystem

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,039
services

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,719
like animal habitat or biodiversity of

78
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,759
plant species so in this picture you can

79
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,080
see two invasive plants dominating this

80
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,318
marsh wetland in the foreground here is

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,959
falaris or indonesia it's reed canary

82
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,919
grass in the background is phagmites

83
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,840
astralis phragmites are commonly and you

84
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,679
can see that they're both growing in

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,598
really dense

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,879
excluding the growth of other plant

87
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,039
species

88
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,039
so

89
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,120
if most natural areas are highly diverse

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,039
how are invasive plant species able to

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,080
do this able to grow so densely

92
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,479
and

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,560
a lot of uh ecological research has

94
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,479
looked into plant traits of these plants

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,759
so the fact that they're able to grow

96
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:47,359
really fast they can grow taller shade

97
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,878
out other plant species but increasingly

98
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,040
people are looking at the effect that

99
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,199
they're having on the soil

100
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,719
many invasive plants change soil

101
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:59,359
properties abiotic antibiotic in ways

102
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,519
that put them at an advantage in other

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,159
competitors at a disadvantage this is

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,438
called soil conditioning

105
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,919
and

106
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,840
i'm interested in how that's happening

107
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,438
with invasive plants and marsh wetlands

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,759
and is that different from what native

109
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,919
plants are doing

110
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,319
so just a little background on what's

111
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,839
happening in most kind of

112
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,399
native plants

113
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,719
natural systems you have density

114
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,399
dependent recruitment of seedlings which

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
contributes to the high diversity that

116
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,439
you see

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,280
so if you imagine the probability that a

118
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,478
seedling will survive

119
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,159
and the density of that particular plant

120
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,839
species in the soil

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,160
there's going to be

122
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,279
higher survival when that plant species

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,360
of low density and lowers survival when

124
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,079
that plant species is at high density

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,120
and the way that people found this out

126
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:54,560
was in the 1970s two ecologists jansen

127
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,680
mcconnell saw that in tropical forests

128
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,040
if there's a parent tree species uh it's

129
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,639
seedlings there's going to be a lot of

130
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,319
species near the parent and that's kind

131
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,960
of what i'm considering a high density

132
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,399
of that particular plant species

133
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,038
they're going to be a few seedlings that

134
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,719
are further away at low density of that

135
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,639
plant species

136
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
and that the seafoods near the parent

137
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,079
tree

138
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,560
die or do very poorly and those that are

139
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,439
further away at a low density have a

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,038
much higher probability of survival and

141
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,959
eventually fitness

142
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,879
so when they first

143
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,799
found this they thought that it was

144
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,560
probably mammals some kind of seed

145
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,639
predators

146
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,120
but increasingly people have found that

147
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,879
no it's plant pathogens in the soil that

148
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,840
are causing these effects

149
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,560
so related to that i wanted to know

150
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,000
what's going on with invasive plants if

151
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,478
they can avoid

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,038
those density dependent effects in the

153
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,839
soil so in this picture i really like

154
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,478
this because this is

155
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,038
phragmites

156
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,560
beautiful tall grass and right in the

157
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,159
background you have another beautiful

158
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,079
tall grass corn

159
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,720
and so a lot of the fields that i work

160
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:06,478
in are right next to agricultural fields

161
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,880
both of these are monocultures of very

162
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,318
dominant very tall grass species and so

163
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,478
those of you who work in agriculture

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,039
know it's really hard to get corn to

165
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,199
grow like this it doesn't naturally want

166
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,639
to not have weeds

167
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,199
if you didn't manage it if you didn't

168
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,879
rotate crops you have

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,360
big problems both with weeds and

170
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,879
diseases so how are invasive plant

171
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,479
species and this plant species in

172
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,279
particular how are they able to do this

173
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,279
with no inputs

174
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,399
and what people are finding is plants

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,720
have different pathogen interactions and

176
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,560
they're native and invaded ranges so if

177
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,199
you think back to those

178
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,519
density dependent soil effects and the

179
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,840
role of soil pathogens that they are

180
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,918
playing a role in the success of many

181
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,079
invasive plant species

182
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,159
so one example of this

183
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,079
why we think this is happening

184
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,600
is that if you grow the same plant

185
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,598
species for the most part in the same

186
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,759
soil year after year it's going to do

187
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,519
more poorly each time those of you in

188
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,840
agriculture know that this is the case

189
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,598
you have to rotate your crops

190
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,198
the same happens with native plants so

191
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:13,759
if you look at plant soil feedback

192
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,160
and over time it will be

193
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,000
lower and lower plant soil feedback

194
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,000
being the term for how much the soil

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,279
kind of feeds back to those plants

196
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,680
survival and success so native plants do

197
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,839
worse and basic plants don't and so

198
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
people have found that they

199
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,638
are neutral when grown in the same soil

200
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,079
or maybe even benefit from it and so

201
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,478
they're having some kind of different

202
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,318
interactions there for native plants

203
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,360
and what we think is happening one

204
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,919
hypothesis is called enemy release and

205
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,360
that is that when invasive plants come

206
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,120
they leave behind

207
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,560
pathogens from their

208
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,280
native range

209
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,879
and it takes time for them to accumulate

210
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,119
and acquire them

211
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,839
when they invade so if you imagine this

212
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,360
invasive plant in its native range it's

213
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,079
going to have a diverse group of

214
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,680
pathogens including some soil pathogens

215
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,758
i've illustrated here

216
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,639
when it leaves those behind in an

217
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,319
embedded range it can sometimes do

218
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,000
better because it's not experiencing

219
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,039
those density dependent magnetic

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,918
feedbacks so one classic example of this

221
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:22,079
was with prunus serotonin our black

222
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:24,719
cherry is invasive in europe and

223
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,680
it's able to grow in really dense stands

224
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,840
unlike here and the reason for that is

225
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,080
that it's encountering less virulent

226
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,278
soil pathogens particularly genus

227
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,278
pythium

228
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,958
that don't have the same density

229
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,559
dependent effects on seedlings so

230
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,478
seedlings are able to survive to

231
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,199
adulthood and that's why it can grown

232
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,519
system stands

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,680
so if that were happening in

234
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,759
a marsh wetlands you'd expect to see

235
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,319
invasive plant species less susceptible

236
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,480
to pathogens in the invaded range than

237
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,640
native plants and you'd expect that

238
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,720
native plants would accumulate more

239
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,720
virulent pathogens than invasives

240
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,080
another hypothesis for how invasive

241
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,760
plants are interacting with pathogens in

242
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,160
a way that puts them at an

243
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,639
advantage is that they're somehow

244
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,039
changing the pathogen population when

245
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,679
they invade uh in a way that puts native

246
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,679
plants at a disadvantage so this could

247
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,278
be them bringing in

248
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,199
pathogens with them

249
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,679
that would then spread into a native

250
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,080
community or it could be just something

251
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,159
about their arrival changes the pathogen

252
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,440
community in such a way that native

253
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:36,399
plants have higher disease and decay

254
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,240
survival so here we've got a plant

255
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,159
coming into a

256
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,200
mixed plant community an invasive plant

257
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,439
and it's bringing with it some pathogens

258
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,839
that would then spread into

259
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,399
the native plant community this

260
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,839
hypothesis is called spill back or spill

261
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,080
over and a few examples are with

262
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,279
invasive grasses in the western united

263
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,120
states

264
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,519
several are known to bring with them

265
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,159
viruses that will then spread into a

266
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,399
native plant population and increase the

267
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,879
disease that they're experiencing

268
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,799
another example that doesn't involve a

269
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,720
plant bringing in anything with it but

270
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,278
just changing the existing pathogen

271
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,600
community is with cheap grass also in

272
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,919
the western united states so cheap grass

273
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,159
is a prolific seed producer

274
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,838
after its arrival there's a lot more

275
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,159
seeds in the soil

276
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,240
the abundance of those seed pathogens

277
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,278
really increases and the native plants

278
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,600
have a hard time out competing

279
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,360
sheepgrass

280
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,000
so if that were happening you'd expect

281
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,639
to see a pathogen community changing

282
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,159
after an invasive plant colonizes

283
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,480
and you'd expect

284
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,838
maybe increased abundance or virulence

285
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,839
of pathogens after invasion

286
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,639
so here are a few different hypotheses

287
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,879
for how pathogens could be driving the

288
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,600
success of invasive plants

289
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,000
both because invasives escape pathogens

290
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,680
from their native range it takes time

291
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,120
for them to accumulate them in an

292
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,958
invaded range

293
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,679
and they might be able to change the

294
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,679
pathogen community when they invade so i

295
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:13,479
want to know how important these are for

296
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,479
invasive plant species

297
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,480
and particularly i want to know what's

298
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,879
going on in marsh wetlands so most of

299
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,519
the studies i just described take place

300
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,519
in forest and grassland systems but

301
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,440
marshes are really important for

302
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,679
understanding invasive success for a

303
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,399
number of reasons first off they're

304
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,679
highly invaded systems so if you think

305
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,600
about the

306
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,599
kind of most important invasive plants

307
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,759
in north america phragmites astralis

308
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,560
three canary grass purple blue stripe a

309
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,319
lot of those are in marshall islands

310
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,838
so understanding what's going on there i

311
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,079
think would be key

312
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,360
second march wetlands provide important

313
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,639
ecosystem services water quality

314
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,399
habitat

315
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,159
in this area a lot of the migratory

316
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,559
birds pass through where i work at the

317
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:02,159
north end of canada lake so

318
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,159
they need that habitat

319
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,160
there's also the issue of the kind of

320
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,920
different plants that are there these

321
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,360
invasive plants are preventing them from

322
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,559
growing

323
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,560
so the biodiversity

324
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,278
also there are lots of omi seats and

325
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,480
fungi in marsh soils when people have

326
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,480
looked so in europe they also have marsh

327
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,639
wetlands in fact some of our invasives

328
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,399
are needed there and so when people have

329
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,720
looked they found really abundant

330
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,639
communities so i want to know if that's

331
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,040
happening here

332
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,879
see bank establishment and seedling

333
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,039
establishment are really key for the

334
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,799
success of a lot of these plant species

335
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,599
so paired with the fact that there are a

336
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,159
lot of soil omi seeds and fungi

337
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,079
i think it's probable that there's some

338
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,000
interaction going on where pathogens

339
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,679
could be determining what the plant

340
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,320
communities look like

341
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,479
and then finally some of the pathogens

342
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,680
that are known to affect

343
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,159
the dieback or kind of death of a lot of

344
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,078
the root species in europe

345
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,958
are omyseeks

346
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,879
similar to what i think we find here so

347
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:10,879
i want to know if they're also playing

348
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,838
an important role in our marsh wetlands

349
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,519
so

350
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,959
before i begin i just want to introduce

351
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,600
you to a few of the plants i'll be

352
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,679
talking about first fragment is astralis

353
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,120
i've mentioned it before

354
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,120
it's non-native uh it's european and i

355
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,839
think it came here in the late 1800s and

356
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,679
since it's been replacing a lot of

357
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,839
native plant species you've probably

358
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,919
seen it on the roadsides it's kind of

359
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,480
lining a lot of the highways but it's

360
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,399
also important in wetlands and it forms

361
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,959
these large clonal patches like you can

362
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,919
see here extremely dense and quite tall

363
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,359
and can get up to 13 feet

364
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,360
and one of the interesting things about

365
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,360
pharmacies is that they're both native

366
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,879
and non-native genotypes here in north

367
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,399
america so that's a good species for us

368
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,879
to be looking at because it gives us a

369
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,120
closely related pair of native and

370
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,278
invasive

371
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,919
i'll also be talking about a couple

372
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,679
other bases palaris or indonesia green

373
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,919
canary grass

374
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,479
and lithuanic area purple blue stripe

375
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,479
you've also probably seen these around i

376
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,199
think this one is particularly beautiful

377
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,278
even though it isn't invasive

378
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,679
and i'll be mentioning a few native

379
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,120
plant species um

380
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,078
uh

381
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,039
epilobium glandulosum as a herbaceous

382
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:29,278
native plant palmer grasses candidances

383
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,120
grass species and the experiments i'll

384
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,958
be talking about i'll be using just a

385
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,839
wide variety of different native plant

386
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,359
species as kind of a proxy for what's

387
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,920
going on

388
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,440
in that community with less attention to

389
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:45,838
what particular hosts or plants are are

390
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,839
experiencing

391
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,000
so the first question i think

392
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,919
for determining if

393
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,759
plant pathogens and soil pathogens in

394
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,240
particular are playing a role in the

395
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,639
success of invasive plant species is

396
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,720
seeing does the invasive plant change

397
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,879
the soil in a way that decreases

398
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,120
seedling survival

399
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,120
so

400
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,480
i want to note phragmites australis that

401
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,159
invasive plant i mentioned initially

402
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,120
is changing the soil

403
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,719
and this could be abiotic or biotic some

404
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,639
invasive plants

405
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,040
exude allelopathic chemicals that are

406
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,198
toxic to other plant species

407
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,958
but i'm particularly interested in the

408
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,799
pathogens so i want to know

409
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,198
is it reducing seedling survival of

410
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:34,639
other plants and is this caused by soil

411
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,639
fungi and neuromyces

412
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,000
and so to get at this question

413
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,680
there are a couple different experiments

414
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,839
i'll mention right now

415
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,958
first i planted seedlings of eight

416
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,880
native plant species at four sites so

417
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,758
here you can see me

418
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,000
carefully of measuring some seedlings at

419
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,560
each side i cleared plots within and

420
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,879
outside of the stand of the front lines

421
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:02,078
so this you can see the dense sprague

422
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,399
bodies around me and the reason i

423
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,319
cleared those sites is that i wanted to

424
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,159
exclude factors like shading and

425
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,399
crowding that people typically think are

426
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,198
why fried vines is so successful and

427
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,879
just look in the field at the soil

428
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,319
so after a month i assess ceiling

429
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,159
survival

430
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,480
and here's a plot outside of the

431
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,919
fragments so you can see i've drawn a

432
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,320
square here just so you can see where

433
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,799
the plot is and the kind of much more

434
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,519
diverse vegetation outside of the

435
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,439
faculty is relative to inside of it and

436
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,799
you can see some little patches of green

437
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,480
here and what those are are the

438
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,879
seedlings that i transplanted this is

439
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,480
one of them the grass

440
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,639
and

441
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,920
what happened was that there was overall

442
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,799
lower survival in phragmite stands so

443
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,120
this is a portion of seedlings surviving

444
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,278
this is plant species transplanted so a

445
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,440
number of different plant species here

446
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:56,799
the yellow is inside and the green is

447
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,680
outside so overall there's a clear trend

448
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,758
that things did better outside of the

449
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,758
stands and inside there were some

450
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,798
site-specific effects so i think you

451
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,959
know these these soil changes take time

452
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,279
to accumulate so one of my sites was a

453
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,798
more recent invasion and it didn't have

454
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,639
those differences and because of that

455
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,838
it's only significant to a couple plant

456
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,400
species

457
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,159
but overall there's a clear trend that

458
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
pharyngeal seems to be doing something

459
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,000
to the soil that decreases the survival

460
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,079
of other plants but what is that so to

461
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,119
answer what exactly is happening in the

462
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:30,480
soil

463
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,959
i did a

464
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,640
secondary study with uh my collaborator

465
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,759
laura martin and some members of erin

466
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,919
glossy's lab um looking at

467
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,119
seasoned survival in a more controlled

468
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:46,000
container setting so i took soil or we

469
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,038
took soil from these fragments common

470
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,880
gardens

471
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,839
that had been conditioned grown with

472
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,320
phragmites and then planted 10 different

473
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,399
marsh wetland plant species in the soil

474
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,839
and half of these containers were

475
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,759
treated with broad spectrum

476
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,759
chlorothalofungicide

477
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,480
that should be somewhat effective

478
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,640
against both fungi and omi seeds to see

479
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,880
if you exclude those from the soil do

480
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,720
you still see fragments having a

481
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,960
negative effect on the survival of these

482
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,960
plant

483
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,480
and so as you can species there were

484
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,320
many containers

485
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,319
um and what we found is similar to uh in

486
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,720
the previous study for some species but

487
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:28,399
not all phragmites did have a negative

488
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,279
effect on ceiling survival so the brown

489
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,759
is potting mix the yellow is a fragments

490
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,759
conditioned soil and the green is that

491
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,640
soil with fungicide added

492
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:41,200
so the asterisks represent a significant

493
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,679
interaction or a contribution

494
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,759
of that factor to the proportion of

495
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,120
seedlings surviving so you can see that

496
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,879
for a few of these species

497
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,439
there was a significant decrease when

498
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,280
they were grown in the fragmented soil

499
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,720
but for pretty much all of them the

500
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,759
fungicide

501
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,759
increased survival and in many cases it

502
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,079
brought survival kind of back up to a

503
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,440
level that it would be in potting mix so

504
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:10,558
if you see right here and here

505
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,440
the fungicide is able to take away those

506
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,440
soil effects

507
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,960
so to answer that question does

508
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,720
phragmites

509
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,720
soil conditioning or the changes that it

510
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,960
makes to the soil affect seedling

511
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,839
survival and how

512
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,160
we did find that it decreases survival

513
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,879
of some plant species but not all

514
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,558
and that this was caused by soil and

515
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,280
fungi or soil or license and fungi for

516
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:40,160
some plant species

517
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,480
so we know that these fungi and almighty

518
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,360
seats are playing a role but we don't

519
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,000
know which species these are so my next

520
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,558
question was trying to identify

521
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,400
which omi seats and fungi are present

522
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,359
and my hypotheses were that they'd be

523
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,519
diverse and abundant um

524
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,000
both for fungi and omics just based on

525
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,279
what people have found in other systems

526
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,919
but that there would be different

527
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,399
pathogens or actually not pathogens

528
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,559
fungi or mystics seeds associated with

529
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,519
different plant species

530
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:14,160
the pathogen part will come later

531
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,960
so for the lmi seeds we sampled field

532
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,960
soil at four sites both phragmites

533
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,679
invaded and non-invaded

534
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,240
and we isolated on my seats using a leaf

535
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,000
bait method so here you can see uh

536
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
there's the soil at the bottom of this

537
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,599
tube it's filled with water and then

538
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,279
there are leaves at the top and that

539
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,678
selects foreign lysines because it

540
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:36,079
requires swirling zoospores to reach an

541
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,840
effect the leaves and then we used a

542
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,798
word selected media

543
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,798
and

544
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,798
after isolating

545
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,839
we extracted dna from the isolites and

546
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,480
sequenced

547
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,000
the its one and two region of the rrna

548
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,279
opera

549
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,480
and so

550
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,240
we've got about 500 isolates and as you

551
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,319
can see they're really dominated by

552
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,798
python species so some phytopythia and

553
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,798
some sacrolitemia but mostly pythium

554
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,840
and if you divide this up by which

555
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,919
pythium species were we seeing

556
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,399
uh pythium and platinum pithium

557
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,280
dissimile pithium heterothalcom and a

558
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,480
trantheridium and aquatile angus todd

559
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,678
and those are kind of the dominant

560
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,919
species but it's worth noting that a

561
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,640
really large percentage about 20

562
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,000
were species that only have less than 10

563
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,360
isolates so not only um

564
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,200
are we seeing

565
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,879
a lot so we're seeing a lot of different

566
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,360
species we're seeing some dominant

567
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,400
species but a lot of minor ones that

568
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,399
still might play a role

569
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,919
so

570
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,799
if you compare how frequently these

571
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,120
species were isolated from bragmani's

572
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,440
invaded and non-invaded soils you do see

573
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,359
some differences some species this is

574
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,240
the difference in isolation frequency

575
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,759
right here so a zero would mean that

576
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,159
there is no difference in how frequently

577
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,480
they are isolated from two soils

578
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,919
these are more common in non-infected

579
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,079
and these are more common in the

580
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,320
pragmatism dated soils

581
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,480
so you can see that some species pythium

582
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,038
irregularity and theophragmitis are more

583
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,279
common in the non-invaded soils while

584
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,679
others like pythium torilosum and

585
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,960
picking their anomalies were more common

586
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,960
in the invaded slaves

587
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,000
so to look at fungi we took a little

588
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,079
different approach

589
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,038
you can see my fantastic field assistant

590
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,759
here

591
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,679
planting containers containers in

592
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:33,279
january

593
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,280
and we buried seed baits at 10 sites

594
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,639
using seeds of nine different plant

595
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,879
species

596
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,640
and these seeds overwintered in the

597
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,480
field and in the spring we collected

598
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,159
them extracted the seeds from each

599
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,679
container

600
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,760
and then we isolated fungi

601
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,600
as you can kind of see this is a seed

602
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,319
from one of those containers and there's

603
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,480
some piping growing out so it took the

604
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:59,519
hypothesis for each

605
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,440
of isolate growing and

606
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,200
repeatedly transferred it so we can make

607
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,440
sure we have pure culture and then we

608
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,120
identified these isolates

609
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,558
sequencing them the same way and so far

610
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,279
i have a

611
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:16,558
larger culture collection of around a

612
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,960
thousand but so far we've sequenced

613
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,918
about

614
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,319
266 isolates and we're seeing a lot of

615
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,759
different fungal species so here's

616
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,599
alternaria boma epicoconum and fusarium

617
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:30,879
seem to be the dominant

618
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,678
genera

619
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,120
but there are a lot of others especially

620
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,440
in this group

621
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,439
general was left with one isolate

622
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,480
and so if we look at this

623
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,480
by plant species so remember we have

624
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,200
those nine different plant species that

625
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,599
we're isolating this fungi from you can

626
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,400
see different fungi are associated with

627
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:57,279
the seeds of different plant species

628
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,200
so each of these circles is a rough

629
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,319
roughly the number of isolates that we

630
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,038
have from each of those plant species so

631
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,720
this is calories and arundelia uh the

632
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,240
invasive that i mentioned with canary

633
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,278
grass so that has a pretty even mix of

634
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,079
different

635
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:16,798
genuses of fungi

636
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,839
but for phragmites uh it's very

637
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:22,798
dominated by foma also some alternaria

638
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,319
and carrick sprinkier which is a native

639
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,679
sedge

640
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,599
the dominant genus is alternaria that

641
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,000
we're finding associated with the seeds

642
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:34,079
and again i did surface to sterilize the

643
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,839
seeds before putting them into these

644
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,519
field sites but it's possible that some

645
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,599
of these

646
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,480
fungi are coming in with the seeds

647
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:46,678
rather than being acquired from the soil

648
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,679
but still some clear differences

649
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,200
uh which fungi and only seeds are

650
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,240
present in marshwell and soils

651
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,200
we did indeed find diverse and abundant

652
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,000
uh omisettes and fungi so for my seeds

653
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,600
the dominant genus was pithium for fungi

654
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
the dominant general were alternaria

655
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,158
foma and epicocom

656
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,120
and there did seem to be different

657
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:12,000
species associated with different plant

658
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,439
species so some fungi or mice it's more

659
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,679
common with

660
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,880
plant species

661
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,080
so

662
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,640
next

663
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,720
i want to know sure we know what's there

664
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,400
but what are they actually doing

665
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,440
so are these

666
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,200
pathogens of marsh plants and if so how

667
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,440
virulent are they

668
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,880
so my hypotheses going into this just

669
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,038
based on

670
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,679
the types of

671
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,519
genera that we were seeing pithium

672
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,519
in particular is that we find a lot of

673
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,960
generalist pathogens

674
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,440
but thinking back to some of those

675
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,919
hypotheses for why invasive plants are

676
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,159
so successful i expected that native

677
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,880
plants would be more susceptible

678
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,640
and that isolates from the native

679
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,720
species would be more virulent

680
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,799
so to test this we

681
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,519
set up bioassays

682
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:05,679
for both fungi and omi seats and here's

683
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:08,879
the structure of that

684
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,440
i added a crew isolates of each on an

685
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,960
auger plate and wait until the mycelia

686
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,440
had grown out

687
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,319
far enough and then added seeds

688
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,640
of different plant species to the cells

689
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,240
so this is a pretty artificial assay

690
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,880
it's definitely not what's going on in

691
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,359
the field but it at least gives us some

692
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,760
idea of whether or not

693
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:32,959
if given all of the opportunities

694
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:36,720
these isolates can be pathogenic

695
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,480
so by pathogenic i mean they decrease

696
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,960
seedling survival

697
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,360
when inoculated relative to a control

698
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,919
that's uninoculated and then for

699
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:48,558
virulence i'm defining that as the

700
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,440
degree of that decrease

701
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:53,119
so in this top frame you can see

702
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,200
a control

703
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,439
an inoculated plate growing with seeds

704
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,798
of fragmented strawless

705
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,640
in this one you can see a

706
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:05,599
non-pathogenic isolate so all of those

707
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,720
seedlings are doing great um here is a

708
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:11,359
low virulence isolate so one that does

709
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,519
decrease the survival of these seedlings

710
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,918
relative to a control but that they're

711
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,918
still pretty high seedling survival and

712
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,960
then in this bottom frame are some high

713
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,440
virulence isolates so few with any of

714
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,319
those seedlings are still surviving

715
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,320
so

716
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,480
we measured seedlings right about the

717
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,639
end of three weeks

718
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,839
and this is for the omi seeds i'll show

719
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,759
them first and then the fungi second so

720
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:38,480
think of this as a heat map with a

721
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,319
different pithium species here

722
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,079
in order of their relative abundance so

723
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,158
how frequently we isolated them from the

724
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,879
soil and here are the plant species that

725
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,240
we tested so these ones in green are

726
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,720
native these ones in yellow are mason

727
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,359
and what you can see is that some plant

728
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,798
species are highly susceptible so the

729
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:01,038
darker the red the kind of bigger impact

730
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,480
the more virulent those

731
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:03,200
pathogens are

732
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,278
and

733
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,159
those with a significant decrease from

734
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,398
the control so those i do pathogenic are

735
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,159
shaded in any shade of rent so those

736
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,719
that are white did not appear

737
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,278
significantly decrease ceiling survival

738
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,278
so the really dark red you can see here

739
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,119
epilobium glandulosa one of the native

740
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,278
plant species was the most susceptible

741
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,479
to these pathogens um and i think this

742
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,960
invasive lithium salicaria was kind of

743
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,360
also extremely susceptible um and you

744
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,558
can see when it inoculated it had very

745
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,558
low ceiling survival

746
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,558
the least was phalaris amnesia an

747
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,720
invasive plant species you can see none

748
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,678
of the isolates we looked at

749
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,960
significantly decreased ceiling survival

750
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,120
some of these

751
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,278
isolates were species were highly

752
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,759
virulent so pythium voludum pythium

753
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,919
phragmitis you can see that pretty much

754
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,398
across the board they decreased seedling

755
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,919
survival to around zero for the plants

756
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,798
that we tested

757
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,278
whereas others were

758
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,278
occasional pathogens or maybe very

759
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:10,480
weakly virulent pathogens such as

760
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:14,798
lithium citrinum right here

761
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:18,079
as well as lithium aqua tile

762
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:19,759
so another way to look at that same beta

763
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,319
would be spreading it out just looking

764
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,079
at two plant species this is a native

765
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:26,319
plant epilibium glandulosa the one that

766
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,000
i mentioned is really susceptible to

767
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,798
these pathogens and this isn't the

768
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,798
invasive crack bodies in yellow and

769
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,398
proportion seedling survival pythian

770
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:38,000
species tested

771
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:39,599
with asterisks for the significant

772
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,159
those that significantly decrease

773
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,240
ceiling survival relative to control so

774
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,480
what you see are a lot of asterisks so a

775
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,599
lot of these interactions are pathogenic

776
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,720
those species do significantly decrease

777
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:54,798
survival but the range of that is really

778
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,880
broad so

779
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:59,200
some of these are just acting as a

780
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,360
pathogen so this is pythium in gestatum

781
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,360
you can see that the survival for

782
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:06,079
equilibrium is pretty much zero when

783
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,678
inoculated whereas for fragments it's

784
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,639
very high

785
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,559
so those are having a that's picking

786
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,960
species having a really different effect

787
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,278
on those two um whereas other technium

788
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,840
dissimile is very similar

789
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:22,159
but some although it's a pathogen for

790
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,558
both it's a far more virulent pathogen

791
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,520
for one relative rather than the other

792
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,480
so if you look at pythagorean

793
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:30,879
accumulative here you can see that

794
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,440
epilipium glandular someone inoculated

795
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,000
has pretty much zero sequence survival

796
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,159
whereas phragmites despite the fact that

797
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,359
it's significantly reduced relatively

798
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,760
controlled

799
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,759
it's not that burial in the package

800
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,678
so if we

801
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,278
divide this up by where these plant

802
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,880
species are coming from and look at the

803
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:54,558
effect of all of the pivotal species

804
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,919
green being native and yellow being

805
00:30:54,558 --> 00:31:00,158
invasive you can see that

806
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,759
the proportion seedling survival it

807
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,000
isn't clearly

808
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,519
higher for the invasive plant species so

809
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,519
if you think back to immune release it

810
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,720
would say that these invasive plants are

811
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,480
going to be less susceptible to

812
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,399
pathogens and we're not seeing that

813
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,480
across the board one of the most

814
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,398
susceptible plant species lithium

815
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,319
salicaria is invasive

816
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,038
but at the same time the most uh

817
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:23,439
resistant of phalaris aminesia is

818
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:25,599
invasive too so they're not clear-cut

819
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,278
divisions between native and invasive

820
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,439
species

821
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,880
we can take this one step further

822
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,360
and look

823
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,720
at individual isolates of a given

824
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,759
species

825
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,079
that are

826
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,558
taken from either the pharmacies invaded

827
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:43,359
or non-invaded soils to see if something

828
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,599
about fragments being there

829
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,359
makes this more virulent community and

830
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,959
so we did this for i think eight

831
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,879
different species

832
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,519
i'm just showing one here pythium and

833
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,440
transuridium but took isolates from both

834
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,798
the phragmites invaded

835
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,798
and non-invaded range and tested their

836
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,639
pathogenicity and virulence to a number

837
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,240
of plant species

838
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,000
which are different colors here and the

839
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,759
green are native

840
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and the yellow is of the invasive

841
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:13,359
bronchitis so what you can see is that

842
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,278
there's not any big difference between

843
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,119
the isolates from the fragments invaded

844
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,480
and the vomit they respond really

845
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,479
similarly

846
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,919
for both for all the plant species we

847
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,880
looked at

848
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,440
so we're not seeing drag mites cultivate

849
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,000
an extremely virulent pathogen community

850
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,320
at least within species

851
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,839
so for the fungi here's another

852
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:37,759
heat map with the isolate source plant

853
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,918
the plant that were

854
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,919
the seeds that we're getting these fungi

855
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,880
from and then the plant species we

856
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,720
tested along here and you can again see

857
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,640
that epilobium glandulosum that

858
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,440
herbaceous native species is the most

859
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,000
susceptible with the darkest

860
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,840
and most red here the biggest decrease

861
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,919
in ceiling

862
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:01,038
um and the least is mule and very

863
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,759
inclinerata which is a native grass

864
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,759
these two invasives here of phragmites

865
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,278
and water and salicaria are kind of in

866
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:10,079
the middle

867
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:12,720
and isolates from some plant species

868
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:16,558
might be slightly more virulent than

869
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,558
others but it's really a mixed bag

870
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,359
so if we again divide this up in the

871
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:24,558
same way as the previous

872
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:27,519
group with online seats and look at

873
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:29,678
those individual fungal species

874
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,038
by these two plant species epiloguian

875
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,559
glandulosum and crackmardes

876
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:38,480
we see similar things that

877
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:41,200
a lot of these significantly reduce

878
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,919
survival relative to the control

879
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,919
but there's a big difference in the

880
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,880
virulence so the degree to which that

881
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,519
negative effect is happening

882
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,840
the most feral and pathogens are these

883
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,359
fusarium species no surprises there for

884
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,879
those of us in the planet college

885
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:59,519
department as well as some of these

886
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,000
alternate areas

887
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,720
but it's not necessarily a kind of

888
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,440
uniform across species so this

889
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,039
alternaria species it significantly

890
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,960
reduces ceiling survival for both

891
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,800
epilogue and glandularism and fragmities

892
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,039
but that's having a bigger effect on the

893
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,039
bowl

894
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,358
so we do the same thing and look at the

895
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,320
kind of sum of all of those fungal

896
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,559
species by plant species and by plant

897
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,119
species origin with the native species

898
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,719
in green and the invasive and yellow you

899
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,919
can see that again you're not seeing

900
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,759
clear cut

901
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,480
differences between the native and

902
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,760
invasive species some of these invasives

903
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,440
are very susceptible and others are not

904
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,520
and in this case the most susceptible is

905
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,280
still the thrombosalicaria

906
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:47,679
and the least is pharmacistalis so

907
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,560
right minds

908
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,200
so

909
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:53,759
getting back to our initial question are

910
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,678
these omysees and fungi pathogens of

911
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,480
marsh plants and so how virulent are

912
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,559
they

913
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,280
um we did find a lot of generalist

914
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:04,159
pathogens so they decreased seedling

915
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,160
survival of a range of plant species but

916
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,440
there were differences in their

917
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:08,559
virulence

918
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,079
and

919
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,759
when looking at whether native plant

920
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,519
species were more susceptible than

921
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,359
invasives this didn't seem to be true

922
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,199
for some

923
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:20,319
invasive plant species but not for all

924
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:23,598
so uh phthalates or indonesia was pretty

925
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,240
resistant to those um fungicides but

926
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,000
lithium salicaria another invasive was

927
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:30,399
highly susceptible

928
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,880
and similarly the pathogens from the

929
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,559
native species weren't more virulent

930
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,559
than those from the invasive

931
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,640
so to summarize

932
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,760
we found that phragmites changes the

933
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,199
soil in some way that decreases seedling

934
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,040
survival

935
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,319
and when we looked at that further we

936
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,759
found that

937
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,920
that was because of only seeds and fungi

938
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,359
in phragmites conditioned soil that were

939
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:02,320
increasing sealant survival

940
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:05,679
we found diverse and abundant omi seeds

941
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,200
and fungi in these marsh wetland soils

942
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,000
and the dominant

943
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:12,879
genera of these were pickium alternaria

944
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,639
foma and epicalcum

945
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,119
and we found different pathogens

946
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:21,279
associated with different plant species

947
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,920
so how do these fit into those

948
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,640
hypotheses i mentioned initially about

949
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,800
how invasive plant species might be

950
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:31,039
interacting with pathogens

951
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,359
so if we think back to enemy release

952
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,960
where part of the reason why an invasive

953
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,358
plant would be successful is because

954
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,320
it's leaving behind pathogens in its

955
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:42,880
native range and it's not acquiring them

956
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,039
in its invaded range

957
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,800
we would have expected to have seen that

958
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,800
invasive species were less susceptible

959
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,160
to pathogens in the invaded range than

960
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,440
native plants

961
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,440
and that the native plants were

962
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,920
accumulating more virulent pathogens

963
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,920
than the invasive plant species so did

964
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,480
we see this

965
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,760
we did for some invasive plant species

966
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,358
but not all so it's not a clear rule for

967
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,040
these marsh wetlands that invasive

968
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,039
plants are acting one way and maybe the

969
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,880
species are acting another way so it

970
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,199
does seem to be the case that alarmist

971
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,119
amnesia is less susceptible to these

972
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,759
pathogens

973
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,838
but for feminism and within salicaria it

974
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,839
doesn't seem to be

975
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,759
so this also doesn't get into the

976
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,078
question of we're just looking in its

977
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,640
invaded range so this doesn't tell us

978
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,640
what's happening in the native ranges of

979
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,480
these invasive species and what those

980
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,319
pathogen communities look like but at

981
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,400
least it gives us a little window on to

982
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,160
what's happening

983
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,320
and then thinking back to the other

984
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,239
hypothesis i mentioned that something

985
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,800
about the addition of this new plant

986
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:47,358
species this invasive plant is changing

987
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,160
the pathogen community in such a way

988
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:51,920
that it would decrease the success of

989
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,000
native plants

990
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,680
spill over or spill back

991
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,239
with that we would have expected that

992
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,078
the pathogen community changes after

993
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,639
invasives colonize

994
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,240
and that it increases the abundance or

995
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:08,400
virulence of pathogens after invasion

996
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,239
so did we see that

997
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,559
we did see that the pathogens seemed to

998
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,399
be different

999
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,880
if we looked at the omycin fellow

1000
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,639
communities of different plant species

1001
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,640
they were different but

1002
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:23,199
we don't know if they're necessarily

1003
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,960
more abundant or more virulent or what's

1004
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,559
happening with that and what effects

1005
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,679
those would have

1006
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,000
on

1007
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,960
the planet

1008
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,358
so

1009
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,920
i think that you know this research lays

1010
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:38,239
the groundwork for more work into what's

1011
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,358
actually happening in marsh wetlands we

1012
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:42,479
now know

1013
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:45,279
uh ritual my seats and flanders there

1014
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,358
we have some idea of their host ranges

1015
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,119
and their virulence

1016
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,199
but i think one of the things that

1017
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,440
definitely comes out is that marsh

1018
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,199
wetlands are

1019
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,440
a little different from the forest and

1020
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,838
grassland systems where other people

1021
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,000
have looked at

1022
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:03,920
pathogen uh basic plant interactions and

1023
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,838
i think that there might be a few

1024
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,760
reasons for that so when people looked

1025
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,599
at invasive plants and grassland and

1026
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,920
marsh systems they tend to find a really

1027
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,240
clear divide between the native plants

1028
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,000
which behave one way and the invasives

1029
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,759
that are different

1030
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and here we're finding that's not the

1031
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,920
case that each plant species kind of

1032
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
does the same thing and i think that

1033
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,440
could be because marsh wetlands are just

1034
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,760
different from those other two systems

1035
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,280
marshes are even the native species tend

1036
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,680
to be quick colonizers they tend to grow

1037
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,040
in clonal stands

1038
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,440
and they're just

1039
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:42,159
different from those species and forest

1040
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,079
grassland systems in addition i think

1041
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:45,279
that we found a lot of generalist

1042
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,320
pathogens

1043
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,720
in these soils which might be uh

1044
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,240
making it so that there's less

1045
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:54,559
post-specific interactions and pathogen

1046
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,639
interactions and more swellings but more

1047
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,799
likely i think that if people

1048
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,639
looked at a broader set of invasive

1049
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,200
species in

1050
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,199
other systems forest grassland systems

1051
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,439
they'd probably find the same thing that

1052
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,358
different invasive plants are

1053
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,599
benefiting from different

1054
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,759
interactions so some may be doing so

1055
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,599
well because they're growing really fast

1056
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,680
others may be interacting with soil

1057
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,079
pathogen communities and that you can't

1058
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,000
really make a blanket statement about

1059
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,800
how invasives are active and how native

1060
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,960
surrounding

1061
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,560
so with that i want to thank everyone

1062
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,559
who made this research possible um

1063
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:35,519
eric thank you so much for being such a

1064
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:37,519
fantastic advisor i really have grown up

1065
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,358
for your mentorship and this is where

1066
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:41,358
you have to sit sit with me because this

1067
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:43,679
is an exit center i'm just not a normal

1068
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:45,279
seminar so i get to thank everyone

1069
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:46,639
marianne

1070
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,000
right there i don't know what i'd do

1071
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:50,239
without you in the lab you're one of the

1072
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,838
few people who's as good in the lab as

1073
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:56,159
in the field and marianne really was

1074
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:57,838
essential for a lot of the it's

1075
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:01,039
particularly the sequencing molecular

1076
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:03,519
work behind this research

1077
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,920
justin lance of fame undergraduate

1078
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,239
assistant right there who is um

1079
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,800
co-writing one of the papers i'll be

1080
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,639
coming from my dissertation with me and

1081
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,640
has really been a great help my

1082
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,759
committee aaron blossie and allison

1083

power

1084
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,839
all of my many undergraduate assistants

1085
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,358
everyone from the glossy lab vicky nuzzo

1086
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,039
and andrea

1087
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:28,159
and then my funding from the atkinson

1088
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:30,000
center and the new york c grant and i

1089
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,159
also want to give thanks to all of my

1090
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,119
colleagues friends families

1091
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:37,519
family for your support and

1092
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,160
i know that's everything from helping me

1093
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:43,358
in the field to listening to my practice

1094
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:46,719
talk and hear my parents there my sister

1095
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:48,960
and they can tell you that i have been

1096
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:50,959
very into marshmallows ever since i was

1097
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,480
a little kid so here is me doing

1098
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,480
approximately what i'm still doing

1099
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,519
so not much has changed there but i do

1100
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,920
feel really grateful to have spent the

1101
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:07,599
past five and a half years surrounded by

1102
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,358
such a great group of

1103
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,000
kind of

1104
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,838
plant pathologists but also friends

1105
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,559
so with that i'll take questions and

1106
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:17,559
thank you all very much
