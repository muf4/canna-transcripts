1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,399
university

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,359
it's going to be an interesting ride

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:14,000
today uh

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:17,358
being 35 plus years at cornell and so

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,960
the title is is it just grass well maybe

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,359
it was working

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,439
okay now it's not all right we'll go

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,800
this way we were having that work or

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,879
maybe it's a little more and that's what

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,719
i want to i think that's my take home

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,198
message when i look at

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,719
turf and turf grass areas i see them

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,559
from a slightly different perspective

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,640
than maybe you might and so that's the

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,399
that's what i want to share today and

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,920
i'm not talking about this kind of grass

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,000
you know it was always the

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
the laughter in my family or i meet

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
somebody well what do you do i said well

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,120
i work with grass and so the snicker is

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,280
is this kind of grass i said no that's

23
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,359
not even a grass but

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,239
but at least it's more like this kind of

25
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:57,039
grass the deal with golf courses and

26
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,839
lawns and sod farms and athletic fields

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,760
and commercial grounds like campuses

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,478
like this

29
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,239
airport strips roadsides i mean anything

30
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,679
that's using grass species that are

31
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,920
routinely mowed

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,118
for all kinds of reasons and all kinds

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,040
of functions

34
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,840
and so what i'd like to go over today

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,240
are some of the kind of functions that

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,719
we use turf grasses and land and in

37
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,039
landscapes as well as part of landscapes

38
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,519
and so there's an aesthetic component a

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,360
financial component a recreational

40
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,359
component and the last one that i'll

41
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,719
actually show a bunch of data on is

42
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,879
ecosystem function uh services for

43
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,879
turf grass and landscapes

44
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,798
and so we can't deny that you have these

45
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,280
beautiful grassy

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,600
vistas that in this case on eastern long

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,519
island the golf course or our beautiful

48
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,039
sports field well maybe thus is not that

49
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,640
beautiful

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,520
i got this picture i'm there how do you

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,280
play soccer on that field you know

52
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,879
or you have a little sneak attack over

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,920
and those shrubs to the bottom left

54
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,519
there it's

55
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,200
and that would be an interesting one to

56
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,438
maintain as well as kind of play on that

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,520
would be a one to nothing kind of

58
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,158
facility but more like a sports field

59
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,679
like this like yankee stadium

60
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,118
that frank's not here today but frank

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,439
has been very instrumental in working

62
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,919
with yankee stadium over the years but

63
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,439
i'm from pittsburgh so the pnc park for

64
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,719
the pittsburgh pirates at least his team

65
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,759
have made the playoffs the last two

66
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,439
years unlike the yankees

67
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,280
yeah i know to kind of rub it in just a

68
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,520
little bit a little bit but a lot of

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,840
times we think about golf and sports

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,040
turf is is like the big thing of turf

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,200
and they are the visible things they're

72
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,199
on television you know articles written

73
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,799
about them and whatever but there are a

74
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,199
lot of

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,360
kind of other uses uh that we might see

76
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,318
so you can see grass is used at art form

77
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,239
and we know

78
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,280
marchand sheebly has done a lot of kind

79
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,360
of sod related projects for from an art

80
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,318
perspective and her students have done

81
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,000
some really cool things with grasses

82
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,958
but a lot of times we think more of the

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,439
traditional version of a landscape

84
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,360
that that we see in in suburban areas

85
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,439
where you have a green carpet adding to

86
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,280
the value of this landscape

87
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,919
that we see there and then so one it may

88
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,598
be a visual thing you may enjoy it um

89
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,439
but also there are some financial

90
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,679
implications and

91
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,759
um there have been a number of surveys

92
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,920
looking at the economic value of

93
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,399
landscapes uh to

94
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,318
to the property value itself and so

95
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,480
landscapes can add as much as seven to

96
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:25,679
fifteen percent to the to the value of a

97
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,518
home uh so poor landscape would uh would

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,080
get you less if you were trying to to

99
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,480
sell that property and so clemson did a

100
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,959
study of showing that homes with

101
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,878
excellent landscapes you can expect to

102
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,158
sell price to be six to seven percent

103
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,000
higher than

104
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,679
an equivalent good landscape and while

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,439
improving your landscape from average to

106
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,360
good you could even see a result of four

107
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,560
to five percent so there is an economic

108
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,560
value to

109
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,840
uh the the even though there is a visual

110
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,158
effect to the to these kind of

111
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,598
landscapes

112
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,919
now you may not have known so i'm going

113
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,719
to throw some facts out how large the

114
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,598
use of turf grasses are say in the us

115
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,280
and so a study done in 2005 estimated

116
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,199
there are over 30 million acres of

117
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,280
maintained turf in new york

118
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,958
in in the united states

119
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,598
and if we come a little bit closer to

120
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,759
home new york state has 30 million

121
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,959
land acres now if we added all the water

122
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,120
in whatever new york state is bigger

123
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,879
than but new york state has 30 million

124
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,720
land acres so all the turfis in the

125
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,639
united states is big of the land area of

126
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,960
new york state within new york state

127
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,319
they're over 3.4 million acres of turf

128
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,198
grass

129
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,879
accounting for from 2003 figures five

130
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,919
billion dollars per year in maintenance

131
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,680
costs

132
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,639
mostly on residential properties that's

133
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,199
about 70 percent of the land area uh

134
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,560
about 43 000 workers with an annual

135
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,478
payroll of at least 500 million dollars

136
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,720
done by the new york state ag statistics

137
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,240
service not an industry group as some

138
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,560
people always like to point out when you

139
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,319
have surveys done while you're just

140
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,839
inflating these figures this was done by

141
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,439
the new york state act statistics

142
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,039
service

143
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,959
but there are a lot of recreational

144
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,160
things if we get away from the beauty

145
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,638
the uh financial value there aren't too

146
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,759
many surfaces natural surfaces that we

147
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,079
have that you can recreate on constantly

148
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,360
and have it be left and frank we're here

149
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,439
his daughter's actually in this picture

150
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,560
that's why one of the reasons i like to

151
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,240
to use it

152
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,839
and it's from trumansburg too that's

153
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,000
some of our fields there

154
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,799
um so we look at this there really

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,680
aren't other natural surfaces that can

156
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
take

157
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,840
constant wear and traffic soil

158
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,160
compaction can be mowed closely those

159
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,519
golf course settings a putting green can

160
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,439
be as low as a tenth of an inch

161
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,839
harvested every day there aren't too

162
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,478
many agricultural systems we harvest

163
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,239
that low and that frequently and

164
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,079
hopefully something will grow

165
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,478
as part of that

166
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,038
but we do have some imposters

167
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:49,279
to this and and one of them we have an

168
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,519
example across the street this greenish

169
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,079
fakus that i'd like to call

170
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,240
is we have a synthetic turf across the

171
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,599
street and this was taken two weeks ago

172
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,439
they're out there irrigating the

173
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,439
synthetic turf across the street you

174
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,478
know it's kind of very ironic that you

175
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,199
would think

176
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,360
in late october we're out irrigating

177
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,680
well it's done to control the speed of

178
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,120
that surface for the ball roll that the

179
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
field hockey players the women's field

180
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,800
hockey field

181
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,959
so even with artificial surfaces you do

182
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,079
need to do some kind of maintenance

183
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,758
including irrigation to some degree but

184
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,359
what i'd really like to cover today is

185
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,600
to talk about

186
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,600
the ecosystem services you could get

187
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,919
from turf grasses and other

188
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,240
suburban landscapes

189
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,680
in that context

190
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,680
and so

191
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,918
there is this however if you're trying

192
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,639
to talk about positives having ecosystem

193
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:43,758
services are there negatives related to

194
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,519
these kind of land uses and so

195
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,800
uh there has been shown and i'm not

196
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,120
going to show data but there's been a

197
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,800
number of studies shown that uh water

198
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,639
quality in suburban areas can be

199
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,000
compromised and it's usually the two

200
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,000
things that are compromised is

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,478
phosphorus levels

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,199
tend to be high and if we were gonna

203
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,279
compare to uh an agricultural setting

204
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,840
those phosphorus levels may be higher in

205
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,079
surface waters than in agricultural

206
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,679
areas nitrogen levels are actually lower

207
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,918
and i'll show some data probably the

208
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,918
reason for that

209
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,918
and are also pesticides that are that

210
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,519
are used in landscapes in these suburban

211
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,799
areas that have compromised water

212
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,159
quality

213
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,038
so from that there have been

214
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
restrictions at both state and local

215
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:28,399
levels

216
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,199
either restricting the type and amount

217
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:34,159
and season of application for pesticides

218
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,319
and fertilizers mostly fertilizers and

219
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
banning pesticides if you

220
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,319
new york state has a

221
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,720
ban on school ground pesticide use

222
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,560
unless there are some very limited ones

223
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,880
you're able to use or you can get an

224
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,478
emergency exception to it and jenny

225
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,319
gowniff has been doing a lot of work

226
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,000
with that because many of the problems

227
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
we have on school grounds are weed

228
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,759
related and trying to manage weeds

229
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,318
without the traditional herbicide

230
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,160
approach becomes quite quite difficult

231
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,400
so that's been one of the parts of this

232
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,840
as we have seen regulations put in and

233
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,560
those of us i mean i work in the

234
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:10,318
political end and restrictions are made

235
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,639
by politicians not by scientists

236
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,000
and quite often i think if they really

237
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,079
understood

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,680
uh the science behind what they're

239
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,439
trying to regulate they might have done

240
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,959
something differently so as an example

241
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,839
new york state has a

242
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:27,038
ban on applying phosphorus to turf areas

243
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:29,279
uh except for a couple couple ways one

244
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,639
if you're establishing a turf area you

245
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,879
can put it down

246
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,320
or you or you take a soil test and

247
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,719
there's a need for it so those are the

248
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,399
kind of two exceptions to it the problem

249
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,479
is the first one

250
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,759
is and i'll we will show you data that

251
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,919
if you were going to be putting

252
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,278
phosphorus down the time establishment

253
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,600
you have very little plants there to

254
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,000
hold on to that those nutrients nitrogen

255
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600
and phosphorus and runoff and leaching

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,360
can be pretty significant a matter of

257
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,360
fact that's the worst time when we look

258
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,959
at all the studies done on the fader

259
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,519
fertilizers and turf that's the worst

260
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,119
time environmentally so the regulator

261
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,039
should have said do a soil test to see

262
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,480
if you need phosphorus and establishment

263
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,679
and even that be careful what you're

264
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,519
putting down but they just gave a

265
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,759
blanket exception because there was a

266
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,679
law passed in minnesota there was one in

267
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,120
wisconsin so new york legislators were

268
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
smart enough just to grab those and

269
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,159
probably not

270
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,399
take the advice of people like me who

271
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,240
wrote to them and asked them to consider

272
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,159
not putting that in there

273
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,919
we do need phosphorus and establishment

274
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,480
because the soil is already adequate and

275
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,958
it doesn't really do you very much good

276
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,759
and then so from that um are there

277
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,199
positives ecosystem wise uh i wouldn't

278
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,360
say to counteract but what are the

279
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,720
benefits we might see ecosystem function

280
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,320
benefits

281
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,600
and we need to i think we need to always

282
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,040
evaluate that in a in a landscape scale

283
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,120
setting

284
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:47,199
so this is this is one thing that epa

285
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,879
put up several years ago make sure you

286
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,720
keep your fertilizer on your lawn and i

287
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,639
think that's a great idea

288
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,160
and if you kind of go down there there

289
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,240
is some stuff that talks about how to

290
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,759
manage turf and we've i've done a lot of

291
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,278
research over the years and most of it

292
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,519
i'm not going to be

293
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,000
showing today that are used to try to

294
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,759
help improve

295
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,679
the management of turf to minimize

296
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,080
environmental impact and we've spent a

297
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,079
lot of time and effort trying to do that

298
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,600
but what i want to cover today is kind

299
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,519
of three parts of ecosystem services

300
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,040
that that we've had graduate students

301
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,639
and i'm mostly giving my own graduate

302
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,679
students data today

303
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,078
um

304
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,838
at looking at what you could from uh

305
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,159
from a turf landscape

306
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,160
uh get what benefits you might get and

307
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,600
one large one we've we have found and

308
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,919
other people who've been studying this

309
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,560
is that storm water amounts the runoff

310
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,078
amounts can be significantly lower in a

311
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,159
turf grass area and they can in other

312
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,319
types of landscapes but it's really

313
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,559
based on the landscape type and the

314
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,959
plant density and the some degree age of

315
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,039
that site

316
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,958
and the second one has to deal with soil

317
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,639
phosphorus and phosphorus runoff and you

318
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,679
might say what is what kind of ecosystem

319
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,199
services

320
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,639
uh is benefit from that and i'll tell

321
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,240
you later because that is one of the

322
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,919
sections and the last one will talk

323
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,919
about carbonate and nitrogen

324
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,799
sequestration which is a big thing these

325
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,719
days in in most ecosystems

326
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,958
and what do we know about turf and that

327
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,079
in that context

328
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,958
so the stormwater one and runoff

329
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,359
said

330
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,759
to talk about in relationship to to

331
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,919
loading rates based on landscape type

332
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,879
and plant density issues

333
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,439
and

334
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,958
i've been fortunate over the years

335
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,519
to have a number of great grad students

336
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,679
zach easton was did a master's and a phd

337
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,159
so this was his master's work he's

338
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,599
currently done at vpi and i just saw

339
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,039
that he won the outstanding assistant

340
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,000
professor in the college of engineering

341
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,439
so i didn't know i was training

342
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,440
engineers but

343
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,600
but zach went on to do very many great

344
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,279
things he was here as a postdoc

345
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,720
in biological environmental engineering

346
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,720
for a number of years and it took a

347
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,480
faculty position down there

348
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,160
it was a turf guy you know it's it's

349
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,278
amazing to see where some of your grad

350
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,838
students go

351
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,078
so what did he determine in his masters

352
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,640
and this is a slide showing plant

353
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,000
density on the bottom shoot density and

354
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,600
on the left you have the amount of

355
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,078
runoff and on the right is the

356
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,959
infiltration rate of that soil so as you

357
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,879
double the shoots going from 5 to 10

358
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,078
shoots per centimeter

359
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,120
you cut the amount of runoff by two

360
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,799
thirds

361
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,560
and the reason you do that is the

362
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,879
infiltration rate doubled over that

363
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,958
period of time and so this kind of tells

364
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,958
us several things if for some reason you

365
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,439
lose plant density or don't have a very

366
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,239
dense surface to begin with runoff can

367
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,639
be a major issue so this was doing this

368
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,399
was done during an establishment phase

369
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,159
the first three months

370
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,000
of when these plots were put in this

371
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,000
this graph was put together so this

372
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,078
helps explain why i have this concern

373
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,600
over when you're putting down fertilizer

374
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,199
and there's no plants there what do you

375
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,360
think is going to happen well the chance

376
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,920
for runoff can be quite significant one

377
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,360
the volume of runoff erosion and also

378
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,360
what might be in that runoff water

379
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,560
um so sites with low density including

380
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,159
established are

381
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,838
really have been shown in this study and

382
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,759
a number of other studies pose the

383
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,040
greatest risk to runoff once it's

384
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,639
established

385
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,240
as we'll see there isn't as much

386
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,159
difference

387
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,480
depending on the landscapes there long

388
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,039
as you can maintain density

389
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,720
so zach went on to do

390
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,319
a landscape scale and this is what

391
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,800
started to get him into the engineering

392
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,120
part environmental engineering

393
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,519
looking at landscape types in a suburban

394
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,278
area and the amount of runoff and its

395
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,440
effect on a perennial stream going

396
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,278
through there so i had two phd students

397
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,440
working with zach easton's ph.d and then

398
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,039
mark slavins

399
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,320
after that with looking at a slightly

400
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,278
different study

401
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,760
so zach's work was done um in the

402
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,000
northeast section of ithaca going from

403
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,799
convenient care on warren road

404
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,919
to

405
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,519
kendall on trip hammer that subdivision

406
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,000
in that area and that's what this this

407
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,799
illustration shows

408
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,559
and the upper this is the watershed that

409
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,838
that stream is affected by and the

410
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,638
watershed the head part of that

411
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,800
watershed is actually the orthology lab

412
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,680
and a lot of wooded areas up there and

413
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:04,319
so if we kind of look here

414
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,239
this is basically his study area down

415
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,720
but this perennial stream flows through

416
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,480
there and he had a gauge here kind of

417
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,160
looking at the inflow

418
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,920
from the area above and then the stream

419
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,319
gage below that measured what happened

420
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,519
during that area of suburbanization so

421
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,560
if you've ever driven through that it's

422
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,919
a it's a typical subdivision homes built

423
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:26,399
in the 50s 60s and 70s for the most part

424
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,198
it's a perennial stream and so he looked

425
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,799
at

426
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,120
at basically

427
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,120
three different landscape types and

428
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,039
there were three replicas in this study

429
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,399
so let me go back

430
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,039
uh he had the upper part of this

431
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,679
watershed the numbers will be one kind

432
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,198
of the mid part of this watershed two

433
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,958
and the ones with three behind it are

434
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,799
the lower part so this is higher

435
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,439
elevation lower elevation and there's a

436
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,439
big difference in that watershed

437
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,839
the location that watershed what might

438
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,279
happen with that so we looked at three

439
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,120
different types of residential

440
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,078
landscapes suburban landscape a high

441
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,519
maintenance lawn convenient care kendall

442
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:02,799
all commercially maintained we didn't

443
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,240
have any control over what they were

444
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,759
doing but we knew what they put on it

445
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,360
wasn't something we defined matter of

446
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,958
fact we probably

447
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,959
knowing after we did soil tests the

448
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,319
soils levels were adequate in phosphorus

449
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,159
they still put phosphorus on but we

450
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,680
didn't want to these are so we just want

451
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,159
to look at real landscapes these are

452
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,519
real sites not not research typical

453
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,519
research plots

454
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,839
he had low maintenance areas that were

455
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,839
primarily grasses mostly mode one of

456
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,000
them was not mood at all and the other

457
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,160
was comparing a suburban wooded area a

458
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,799
deciduous tree area and looking at at

459
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,278
runoff and what was in that runoff on

460
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,120
this site so zach had this was a

461
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,559
three-year study so this kind of shows

462
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,120
the three different areas a high

463
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,119
maintained turf runoff collecting area

464
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,600
the low maintenance area and a wooded

465
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,399
area primarily with deciduous trees with

466
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,480
the litter drop from those trees

467
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,240
anytime there was an event

468
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,879
a runoff end greater than a tenth of a

469
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,278
millimeter they were collected and on

470
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,600
some of the plots there were 127 runoff

471
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,600
events in three years and he measured

472
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,839
dissolve react to phosphorus nitrate

473
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,320
ammonium and then be able to calculate

474
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,480
mass loss knowing the volumes of of

475
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,399
those areas

476
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,000
and so the i just wanted to show this is

477
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,480
a summary mostly to tell you about

478
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,320
season and two things but first is

479
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,159
the amount of runoff in the first two

480
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,199
years in the highly maintained turf site

481
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,679
compared to the wooded and low

482
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,319
maintenance area were significantly less

483
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,638
a third on this area

484
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,480
compared to this low maintenance turf

485
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,399
and about

486
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,079
two times less with the

487
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,919
uh the high maintenance turf area

488
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,159
compared to the wooded area and the

489
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,919
reason is is that type of dense plant

490
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,838
vegetation

491
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,838
a tremendous amount of surface rooting

492
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,079
and root activity earthworm activity

493
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,000
high infiltration rates runoff is

494
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,159
significantly less now if i were a storm

495
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,759
water management person and i didn't put

496
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,278
labels on this and you showed me these

497
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,199
things it said well what landscape would

498
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,120
you want to reduce runoff in stormwater

499
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,879
management you definitely would want

500
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,879
something like that so this is a benefit

501
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,958
that we don't always think about

502
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,600
in these landscapes but it's a it's a

503
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,359
it's a very significant landscape effect

504
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,838
this is the creek that runs a little bit

505
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,519
to the south of

506
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,639
uh

507
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,240
it goes through kendall yeah it crosses

508
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,919
yep

509
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,679
yep

510
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,799
it's a small stream it's a perennial

511
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,519
stream

512
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,879
and uh very flashy which it reflects

513
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,199
runoff so if you get a little bit of

514
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,799
precipitation it'll be runoff and that's

515
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,880
so that stream is a very good stream to

516
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,440
study runoff because it does

517
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,440
it does quickly show

518
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,200
what can happen in that stream yeah it's

519
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,798
not a very big one it was an interesting

520
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,120
place though

521
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,400
okay this is a very busy table so i'm

522
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,000
going to try to

523
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,240
kind of walk you through it again we had

524
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,119
these three zones within that watershed

525
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,440
the threes were the lower end the ones

526
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,399
as we will see had the greatest amount

527
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,000
of runoff the most events runoff events

528
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,759
and the and the amount of runoff

529
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,839
occurring on this is an average amount

530
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,679
in each one of these runoff events this

531
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,759
middle section and then the and then

532
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,640
again on the upper end had the lowest

533
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,200
amount

534
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,720
of runoff events and the amount of

535
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,880
runoff occurring

536
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,880
so i highlighted the the ones that were

537
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,120
significantly different

538
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,120
so in runoff we had dissolved reactive

539
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,159
phosphorus either the concentration on

540
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,639
average this is the average

541
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,240
concentration coming out of those

542
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,240
those individual events and then the

543
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,200
total load of phosphorus coming from

544
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,038
that

545
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,720
so we could see in this lower part of

546
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,119
the watershed where there was the

547
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,600
greatest amount of significant amounts

548
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,079
of runoff we could see the fertilized

549
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,399
turf areas compared to the unfertilized

550
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,839
or forested area i really want to call

551
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,840
it a wooded area

552
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,319
we're significantly higher

553
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:45,199
and the total total phosphorus

554
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,839
concentration uh was also higher and the

555
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,319
load was just significantly higher than

556
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,279
than than only one of the two

557
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,798
if we look at the middle and upper parts

558
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,279
where the amount of runoff was

559
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:00,000
significantly less than those two areas

560
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,839
both in amount and on

561
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,440
and the number of events

562
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,959
we could see that

563
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,038
we could see less phosphorus runoff

564
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,519
in the the load of phosphorus runoff in

565
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:14,000
that area or at least it's relatively

566
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,000
equal in the upper end

567
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,440
the dissolved phosphorus ones we could

568
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,119
see there were no difference between

569
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,000
these landscapes or if there was in one

570
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,959
case it was slightly higher but the high

571
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,640
highly maintained turf was actually

572
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,000
less than that case

573
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,080
and what zack has

574
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,319
has concluded in this case that if we

575
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,558
kind of look at these

576
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,720
sites with low to moderate potential for

577
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,678
runoff and a watershed like that is

578
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,880
actually

579
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,880
a very uh

580
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,000
this is a very good kind of watershed to

581
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,760
study that uh high maintenance lawns had

582
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,599
the same or lower amount of dissolved

583
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,079
phosphorus total phosphorus runoff

584
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,319
compared to the unfertilized turf areas

585
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,558
or the wooded sites but the roof but the

586
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,879
issue was however when you get in these

587
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,480
high potential for runoff sites

588
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,919
we did see with the high maintenance

589
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,679
lawn there was an increase in the

590
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,400
loading rate of dissolved phosphorus

591
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,400
likely from fertilizing

592
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,160
but there was a quarter of them on the

593
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,559
particulate phosphorus loss because we

594
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,400
also measured in the sediment that came

595
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,918
off of those plots

596
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,320
so there was a reduction in that again

597
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,720
that reflects back the high density

598
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,240
area that increa that increases

599
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,079
infiltration rate

600
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,679
the amount of particulate or erosion was

601
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,599
significantly less

602
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,519
and then the same amount of total

603
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,279
phosphorus in the runoff compared

604
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,599
unfertilized and low maintenance areas

605
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,200
and wooded sites total p being slightly

606
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,079
different than the dissolved pea usually

607
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,279
dissolved phosphorus does relate back to

608
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:43,279
fertilization in many cases

609
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,879
so what happened in that stream over

610
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,359
this study it was kind of an interesting

611
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,760
thing you might think

612
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,918
that suburbanization is likely going to

613
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,000
do something it was shown that

614
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,240
suburbanization in that suburban part of

615
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,919
the water said that the outflow

616
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,159
uh the stream had the same level of

617
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,919
nitrates had higher ammonium levels

618
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,039
likely from the fertilization that was

619
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,280
occurring

620
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,960
uh more dissolved

621
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,759
phosphorus

622
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,038
during storm water storm events not

623
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:16,240
during kind of base flow of that stream

624
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,879
and higher particulate loss uh quote

625
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,880
erosion than the undeveloped section of

626
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,679
that watershed

627
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,520
so it is interesting to show that as as

628
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,759
as we kind of showed in the introduction

629
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:31,279
to this that you can see

630
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:34,558
suburban areas being a a source of

631
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,798
phosphorus uh and fertilized lawns

632
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:38,720
if you have a lard of that watershed

633
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,879
that's in in

634
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,038
in a higher risk are more likely to have

635
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,679
an impact if you have areas with really

636
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,759
moderate to to minimal runoff losses the

637
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,880
landscape itself has very little to do

638
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,319
with what

639
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,760
what might be coming off that area

640
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,599
okay

641
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,759
so the second student to kind of

642
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,879
followed on this was was

643
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:02,720
was mark slavin's uh he was looking at a

644
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,320
little different version of landscape

645
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,200
types

646
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,240
and runoff and actually unleashing uh

647
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,400
and

648
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,480
and and now mark is a vice president of

649
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,559
environmental affairs with with the

650
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,079
scots company and has been actually very

651
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,519
good at supporting us it's nice to have

652
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,000
somebody in these companies when you

653
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,079
need seed and fertilizer and they're

654
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,079
making some significant contributions to

655
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,519
some projects we've had

656
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:26,879
we'd like to get some research money on

657
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,639
them too but it's nice to actually get

658
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,600
some product too

659
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,799
so his objective in his his phd work was

660
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,158
trying to determine the relationship

661
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:39,279
between lawn density and composition

662
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:43,120
on nutrient and pesticide loading

663
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:46,240
and he had basically four

664
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,678
kind of grass type perennial grass type

665
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,038
lawn treatments

666
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,320
and four

667
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,798
uh

668
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:56,000
sometimes perennial but non-typical kind

669
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:58,639
of grass lawn types and so we had one

670
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,839
with kentucky bluegrass

671
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,679
and

672
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,519
what we did is basically had four of

673
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,080
these that were initially soldered with

674
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,679
kentucky bluegrass so you had nice plant

675
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,199
density to start with

676
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,080
one that after that point all it did

677
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,000
would get what was to get mowed one that

678
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,158
we added fertilizer to

679
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,480
fertilizers and pesticides fertilized

680
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,880
pesticides and irrigation so going from

681
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,200
intensity of minimal maintenance other

682
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,200
the mowing to the most intense one where

683
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,200
we're adding even irrigation into it

684
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,320
and so basically we put on as it turns

685
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,240
out a program very similar to what scots

686
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,839
would sell you in a four-step program

687
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,240
for your lawn so there were four

688
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,000
applications with fertilizer and these

689
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,038
were the pesticides were in those to

690
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,839
control

691
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:48,319
broadleaf weeds broadleaf weeds and

692
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,759
insect and annual grassy weeds

693
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,519
so that would be something if you went

694
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,000
to went down and bought a typical

695
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,000
program this is what you might see

696
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,519
for a typical lawn

697
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,599
high maintenance line

698
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,639
so the other set of treatments involved

699
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,119
having

700
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,840
either directly having other kinds of

701
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,719
weedy material in there

702
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:12,000
smooth crabgrass and smooth crabgrass

703
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,079
with half turf so we plugged out half of

704
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,640
this area and i say we i didn't do that

705
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,399
but mark and my technician jeff and

706
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,400
helpers did that

707
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,080
so that you had a 50 at least initially

708
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,679
50 turf grass 15 annual grass

709
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,240
and the annual ones these were just

710
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,159
seeded each year to to try to keep those

711
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,159
in there

712
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,080
a broadleaf wheatie one that had very

713
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,480
high broadleaf had high very high

714
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,480
density in it and then one again we

715
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,519
plugged in uh

716
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,480
kentucky bluegrass sod initially at one

717
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,720
one to one weed broadleaf weed to

718
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,278
um to grass and there were four

719
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,400
replicates of of these treatments

720
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:52,480
okay

721
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,120
so we wanted to do a typical kind of

722
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,919
residential suburban con

723
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,918
type installation so the bulldozer was

724
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,799
brought in removed all the soil brought

725
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,360
back

726
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,119
and and compacted with equipment like

727
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,879
this to simulate what you do when you

728
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:11,038
build a a new site and the top soil was

729
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,600
put back on it

730
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,359
we did two sets of types of collections

731
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,278
in this study

732
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,798
we had these

733
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,200
two by three foot

734
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,400
lysometers pushed in the ground pulled

735
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,960
out

736
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,400
a bottom pvc bottom put on and a drain

737
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,759
line coming out of those so all the

738
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,679
water that would be infiltrating through

739
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,759
the soil and leaching out would would be

740
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,720
collected those are on the upper surface

741
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,400
of these

742
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,880
of these plots

743
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,440
and at this the slope is about a nine to

744
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,840
twelve percent slope uh

745
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,679
we've put a

746
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:46,399
a gutter collecting system so that all

747
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,240
runoff events coming from those areas so

748
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,120
you can see this is

749
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,440
crab grass not very much there the the

750
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,439
perennial broadleaf weed area and then

751
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,720
the straight kentucky bluegrass next to

752
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,558
it this is what they look like at

753
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,558
establishing

754
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,319
so what did we find in from a leaching

755
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,000
perspective

756
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,399
we found that there were this is the

757
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,599
volume of of leaching occurring over a

758
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,080
two year period uh that except for one

759
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,519
kind of plot uh most of them had a

760
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,278
similar amount

761
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,000
uh over that period of time there were

762
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,519
about 1100 millimeters of of

763
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
precipitation

764
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,319
and we can see that we're seeing about

765
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,319
some of these ones about a third of what

766
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,918
the precipitation end up leaching

767
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,158
through the soil which is actually a

768
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,880
pretty high amount

769
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,200
as compared to some other studies

770
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,440
and so what did things like nitrate look

771
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,679
like concentration and a lot of times

772
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,960
and so this is the nitrate mass loss

773
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,440
over time

774
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,360
and if we kind of look up here this this

775
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,679
highest one up here

776
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,199
okay it's the one with one dash mark

777
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,480
made these slides i didn't i would have

778
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,759
probably made a little bit different

779
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,000
version so it may be a little bit easier

780
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,000
to read we can see and this is the these

781
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,278
are approximately

782
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,759
samples taken monthly bulk together

783
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,159
monthly and then been analyzed

784
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,640
we can see that the worst one in this

785
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,120
case happened to be the one that is at

786
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,520
least comparing the turf ones the one

787
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,119
that was turf with nothing else added to

788
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,119
it

789
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,479
and as we can see the one with the

790
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,798
highest

791
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,558
kind of after that tends to be the the

792
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,720
turf with fertilizer and a little bit

793
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,399
less with the other ones then after this

794
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,079
kind of establishment even though these

795
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,038
were sought after this establishment

796
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,918
year there were a couple peaks later on

797
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,519
and and it reflected

798
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,038
sometimes some treatment was slightly

799
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,278
higher than the others but there was

800
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,720
always a baseline amount coming out of

801
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:42,798
these

802
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,400
and and sometimes ones higher

803
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,839
especially with the irrigation and we'll

804
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,278
talk we'll certainly show that in in

805
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:51,278
runoff so that's what nitrate leaching

806
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:54,640
looked like

807
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:54,640
now at the other plots

808
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,240
okay

809
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,158
the ones mostly with weeds in it the

810
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,079
scale of these are the same

811
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,960
we saw before i'm not scared sometimes

812
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,798
you can

813
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,278
you can i wouldn't say skew diff those

814
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,960
things but the scale of the the of the

815
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:11,359
data is the same in these in these

816
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,120
curves so we can see

817
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,119
some of the worst ones

818
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,558
that we saw were similar to before was

819
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,558
this first year

820
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,879
peaking either

821
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,720
say the second

822
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,039
set of samples

823
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,319
time back to about the end of the

824
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,119
growing season if we were kind of

825
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,879
looking at periods of time

826
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,798
and we can see that crab grass and

827
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,559
crabgrass with turf grass in it

828
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,119
especially the crabgrass and turfgrass

829
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,759
one had losses similar to what we saw

830
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:42,079
with the ones with fertilizer fertilized

831
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:45,839
up these weren't fertilized at all uh

832
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,839
after after they were established

833
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,720
okay

834
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,440
so if we summarize the the kind of

835
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,640
losses in this

836
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,640
um and

837
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:02,798
okay if we look at that the the greatest

838
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,639
loss we saw very little ammonium loss

839
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:06,398
and this is typically we see in turf

840
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,399
studies that we don't see much ammonium

841
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,079
leaching even if you put ammonium-based

842
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,079
fertilizer gets converted to nitrate

843
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,000
pretty quickly the greatest loss was

844
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,918
with nitrate and a little bit of organic

845
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,119
nitrogen coming out

846
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,440
on an application basis uh the one that

847
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,678
we put on that had uh turf with

848
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,399
fertilizer it was equivalent to about

849
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,880
1.8 percent of the nitrogen it was

850
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,879
applied leach through that that system

851
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,640
um and it was the only one that was

852
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,960
significantly different than other

853
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,720
treatments was the broadleaf one it

854
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,600
started low it never really had anything

855
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,759
leaching out nothing was applied to it

856
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,519
and it didn't change over time and

857
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:44,720
actually these tend to stabilize over

858
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,519
time

859
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,440
so the the kind of take home message

860
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,000
tends to be

861
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,679
that a dense perennial system whether

862
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,720
it's with grasses or broadleaf weeds are

863
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,399
pretty good so this is phosphorus i mean

864
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,558
this is runoff and the total amount of

865
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,079
runoff that occurred on the over the two

866
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:04,000
year period

867
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,960
and again if we look at these numbers we

868
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,119
were seeing 400 millimeters with

869
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,200
leaching we're down to about a hundred

870
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,439
so only about a tenth of what came on as

871
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,919
precipitation

872
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,360
ran off these sites which is relatively

873
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,679
i would think is relatively low even

874
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,519
though it's very sloppy area

875
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,960
these are relatively low

876
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:28,000
we can see that areas with turf grass

877
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,079
with fertilization tend to get the

878
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,200
amount of runoffs less than some of the

879
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,038
other treatments especially if we

880
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,720
compare it to crabgrass which was the

881
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,798
worst

882
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,399
but when we put even though we put

883
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,000
fertilizer and pesticides when we

884
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,319
irrigated that we see the amount of

885
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,319
runoff jumped up pretty significantly

886
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,398
and the reason that occurs it wasn't the

887
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,639
irrigation itself creating runoff but it

888
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:51,038
keeps soil and seed moisture content

889
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,360
higher and then any precipitation can

890
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,278
more likely run off and so there has to

891
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,599
be a caution i think

892
00:30:55,278 --> 00:31:00,079
in areas with irrigation

893
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,519
you run the risk of keeping soils more

894
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,119
likely to be

895
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,278
produced runoff so that's just the

896
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,678
volume of runoff that occurred

897
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,278
so how about the amount of in this case

898
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,880
phosphorus

899
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,480
in the runoff as well as nitrogen and

900
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,080
ammonia there was a little bit of

901
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,319
ammonia not related to to treatment

902
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,798
there was some nitrate again hardly

903
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,960
relationship to to the treatment but

904
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,839
there was slightly higher amounts of

905
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,759
phosphorus in that runoff but relatively

906
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:31,038
small on the amount that was actually

907
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:34,319
applied so we could see going from turf

908
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:36,158
itself with fertilizer with pesticides

909
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:39,119
for some reason with pesticides saw

910
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,679
slightly higher amounts of of nitrogen

911
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,479
running off

912
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,759
and

913
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,480
with irrigation we didn't see we

914
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,440
saw slightly less than what we saw there

915
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,599
but

916
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,558
but again the the amounts are are

917
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:57,038
relatively small and that all landscapes

918
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,879
lose some and this is what

919
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:01,359
has always been my pet peeves people say

920
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,399
well let's just let's just let it go is

921
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,319
it going to be better for the

922
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,398
environment there's always some loss out

923
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,960
of these systems they're not 100 percent

924
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:11,038
at retaining retaining nutrients

925
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,600
so mark concluded from this regardless

926
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:16,158
of the plant type low plant density and

927
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,000
high in the seed moisture content

928
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,760
gave were the greatest factors affecting

929
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,880
runoff volumes

930
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,319
and so the need to maintain a dense

931
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,240
canopy

932
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,240
is very important perennial canopy is

933
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,000
very important an annual one you could

934
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,558
have crabgrass being very dense in

935
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,720
august and once the first frost comes in

936
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,319
in in september october november

937
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,798
whenever that might be you start losing

938
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:43,038
plant density and those areas become uh

939
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:45,038
quite leaky and likely to show problems

940
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:47,200
and he also concluded that the ammonium

941
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,200
and phosphorus losses in runoff were low

942
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,440
but increased with time they were they

943
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,159
were occurring their relative amounts

944
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,159
were relatively low

945
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,760
in overall nutrient loading runoff and

946
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,640
leachate were less than two percent of

947
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:03,599
the nnp that were applied

948
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:07,038
because i've seen laws written around

949
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:09,519
the fact that we see 25 percent loss of

950
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,679
fertilizer applied to turf areas

951
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,759
massachusetts is a very prominent one

952
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,080
likes to write land use laws around that

953
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:18,158
where there's no data to ever back it up

954
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,158
which again as a scientist you tend to

955
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,840
get

956
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,480
you get a little upset when you're

957
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:26,879
making laws that aren't based on facts

958
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,319
okay so the second one of the ecosystem

959
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,240
service stuff i want to talk about is

960
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,678
soil phosphorus and phosphorus runoff

961
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,599
and you might say what the heck does

962
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,440
this have to do with

963
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:38,959
with ecosystem functions well this was

964
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,278
done with doug saldat uh did his phd

965
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,600
he's currently an associate professor at

966
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:45,278
uh youth university of wisconsin in

967
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:48,639
madison and the department of soil

968
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:51,919
science went back to his home department

969
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,840
um so what's it have to do with

970
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,320
soil phosphorus and phosphorus runoff

971
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,759
from turf and an ecosystem service well

972
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,678
one of the things we

973
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,599
and actually i got grants to do this was

974
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,679
to look at turf grass sites as a

975
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,319
potential for

976
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,759
taking compost especially animal-based

977
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,960
compost

978
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,800
to remove

979
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,960
that from a farm that has excess

980
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,599
phosphorus because of importing all the

981
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,760
feed so they can reduce their surface

982
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,320
phosphorus water quality problems and

983
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,639
put on a large landscape like turf and

984
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,480
we also see there's a lot of interest in

985
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,599
using massive amount of yard waste

986
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,838
compost in turf and residential areas as

987
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,399
a way to to re you know get rid of those

988
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,480
as well as reuse those materials

989
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,559
so there could be if you can retain all

990
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,398
this phosphorus in that system that

991
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,239
might be a great ecosystem service you

992
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:43,440
don't then that this would not be a very

993
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,439
good system to do

994
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,240
so we looked at uh doug looked at first

995
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,239
taking some long-term

996
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,239
soil nutrient calibration sites we had

997
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,479
worked on putting phosphorus levels of

998
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,239
different amounts on and these were four

999
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,000
sites all across

1000
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,078
new york going from the adirondacks to

1001
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,639
long island that are fertilized at

1002
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,720
typical fertilizer rates not something

1003
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,239
that would not be typically done about

1004
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,399
twice as much of what the soil test

1005
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,239
would require but probably within more

1006
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,280
traditional range

1007
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:18,559
and so in these sites we had doug did

1008
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,359
two things one he removed the soil

1009
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:24,000
and removed the the turf that was on it

1010
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,000
and looked at the runoff that occurred

1011
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,760
from that so this is soil test level on

1012
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
these individual plots

1013
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,400
versus the amount of phosphorus in in

1014
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,159
runoff the concentration and runoff and

1015
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,119
so without turf there

1016
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:39,118
you see a pretty uh pretty consistent

1017
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,880
increase in as if you increase the soil

1018
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,960
phosphorus level you're going to see a

1019
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,480
corresponding increase in the amount of

1020
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,039
phosphorus and runoff

1021
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,039
and that's pretty typical of of kind of

1022
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,079
typical kind of bare or

1023
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:56,880
annual cropping systems where you can

1024
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,839
see a pretty uh consistent and a very

1025
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,358
useful tool then to to look at reducing

1026
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,119
phosphorus levels to make sure you don't

1027
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,358
have excess amount of phosphorus in the

1028
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,838
soil but there there was this kind of

1029
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:10,480
this relationship but what happens on

1030
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,078
the same plot with actually turf on it

1031
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,760
and the turf would be growing and see

1032
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,839
what that impact would be

1033
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,839
so in this case the exact same plots

1034
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,920
with with with the dense turf grass on

1035
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,559
them we see kind of no relationship

1036
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,480
between soil level uh at least in the

1037
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,920
range where we're raising phosphorus

1038
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,320
levels

1039
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,440
from typical applications and the amount

1040
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,480
of phosphorus that's in that runoff

1041
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,400
and so when you kind of look at this

1042
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,960
where again the new york state law and

1043
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,440
many other states they do a soil test

1044
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,519
and if there's adequate amounts on don't

1045
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,079
apply it well there's a pretty our

1046
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,239
recommendations are down here at four

1047
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,960
if you have four or more pounds of

1048
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,078
available phosphorus per acre

1049
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,679
that you

1050
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,680
you have sufficient you wouldn't need to

1051
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,838
put an application on but you can see

1052
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,799
that could be significantly higher than

1053
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:00,719
that

1054
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,800
and not really see any major

1055
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,439
environmental impact

1056
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,760
now are there situations however

1057
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,679
that we see soil levels get highly

1058
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,320
elevated from phosphorus

1059
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,960
and one of them is back to this question

1060
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,640
of using compost on

1061
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,039
turf and in landscapes and i want to

1062
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:21,598
kind of expand it to the landscape ones

1063
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:23,838
in turf areas we quite often if we're

1064
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,200
going to apply a compost as a soil

1065
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:26,880
amendment we're going to put a fair

1066
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,039
amount on a quarter or a half inch

1067
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,200
material in this case we did it with a

1068
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,358
dairy compost

1069
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,199
and and you and i'll show slide that you

1070
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,358
work it in and that's on established

1071
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,679
turf so this is a typical kind of rate

1072
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:41,358
that's used to try to improve organic

1073
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,598
matter in the soil

1074
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,199
a better turf overall

1075
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,880
but when we calculated how much

1076
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:49,279
phosphorus that was at available

1077
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,838
phosphorus that was actually putting on

1078
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,320
a quarter inch was about 300 pounds per

1079
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,480
acre of available phosphorus and double

1080
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,480
that if you put a half inch on

1081
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,000
we're again our typical fertilizer rates

1082
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,559
that are about

1083
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,400
a tenth of that so you might expect if

1084
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,078
we're putting on these extremely high

1085
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,599
loads of phosphorus

1086
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,000
that you would have you could have a

1087
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,000
potential for phosphorus runoff so this

1088
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,239
is what the actual plots look like and

1089
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,480
if we did the same kind of study

1090
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,799
that we showed earlier that doug did in

1091
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,280
this case with these are the ones we had

1092
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,359
that we didn't put any compost on they

1093
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,800
were down less than 50

1094
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:25,679
pounds per acre

1095
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,839
of

1096
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,838
of available phosphorus

1097
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,078
but once we start putting compost on you

1098
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,880
can see we could elevate these levels up

1099
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,119
to 500 pounds per acre and the amount of

1100
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,760
phosphorus in the runoff significantly

1101
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,280
went up and so there to me there is a

1102
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,160
big concern about taking using

1103
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,040
landscape areas

1104
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:50,000
that

1105
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:53,039
with high rates of compost applications

1106
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,199
especially if there are are uh

1107
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,279
are nutrient-rich ones which are

1108
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,960
typically dairy or poultry other

1109
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,560
animal-based ones

1110
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,119
and so there are two issues with that

1111
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:06,000
one that you can saturate the soils the

1112
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,760
soil's ability to to retain phosphorus

1113
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,239
and you increase that risk of phosphorus

1114
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,160
run up pretty significantly

1115
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,719
and the second part is there's another

1116
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:16,159
kind of ecosystem effect that that is is

1117
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,159
is going to be depressed is you're going

1118
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:20,639
to suppress the carbon nitrogen

1119
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:23,118
sequestration you would typically get an

1120
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,199
area with less less organic matter and

1121
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,119
so when we start loading up our

1122
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,439
landscapes with

1123
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,440
with compost two things could happen one

1124
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,960
if there are nutrients in those compost

1125
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,280
you could run the risk of a lot of

1126
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,280
phosphorus runoff or you're certainly

1127
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,200
going to reduce that site's ability to

1128
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,040
sequester both carbon and nitrogen if

1129
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,358
you have a tremendous amount of both

1130
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,679
those matter of fact they'll probably be

1131
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:47,759
losing those as that that compost

1132
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,838
degrades and mineralizes you're going to

1133
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,960
see carbon and nitrogen being released

1134
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,440
out of that system you're not going to

1135
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,039
really retain very much other than if

1136
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,838
you have above ground

1137
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:57,838
plant parts there

1138
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,000
so the last part i want to cover on on

1139
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,560
this ecosystem part is carbon carbon and

1140
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,800
nitrogen's equation sequestration and i

1141
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:10,880
worked with steve rossetti steve was a

1142
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,480
phd student over natural resources i

1143
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,760
happened to be on his committee because

1144
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,599
he was doing turf work so i thought that

1145
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,240
was kind of cool and now he's currently

1146
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,359
an assistant professor at hofstra

1147
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,719
uh i went to bu for a boston university

1148
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:24,559
that'd be you

1149
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,838
for a postdoc when he left here and then

1150
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:30,078
he has a university position so what did

1151
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,239
what did steve do well steve was working

1152
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,440
in the the

1153
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,078
baltimore

1154
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,960
ecosystem study long-term ecosystem

1155
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:42,000
study area and he took soil cores out of

1156
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,079
residential areas and forested areas

1157
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,838
there were 32 residential sites he

1158
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,079
worked with and eight forested sites

1159
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:52,559
again those forested sites were from the

1160
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,960
baltimore ecosystem their long

1161
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,400
term ecosystem research studies that

1162
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,760
that they've been doing this site for a

1163
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,599
number of years

1164
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,599
and these the

1165
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,079
ones coming from the residential areas

1166
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,920
were primarily lawns with cool season

1167
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,839
grasses in it and

1168
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,760
there were a few you know trees and

1169
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:11,358
shrubs in the area but but the primary

1170
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,839
landscape feature where he was sampling

1171
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:16,000
was from lawn areas

1172
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,000
and so he took one meter deep

1173
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,400
undisturbed cores broke them up into

1174
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,318
four zones it looked at total

1175
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,920
nitrogen and carbon

1176
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,759
in those samples

1177
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,680
and really by knowing the bulk density

1178
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,160
then can relate back to

1179
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:32,639
an amount on an area basis so what did

1180
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:35,279
steve find well he found comparing

1181
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,679
residential to forested that there was

1182
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,560
more carbon stored in those soils in

1183
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,078
both in residential and nitrogen than

1184
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,639
forested areas

1185
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,480
uh the amount of uh the carbon nitrogen

1186
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,559
ratios were similar in those but the

1187
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,800
absolute amount of carbon

1188
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:53,279
in the residential soils lawn soils

1189
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,720
compared to the forest areas on the same

1190
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,440
soil series

1191
00:41:54,719 --> 00:42:00,159
were significantly higher

1192
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,880
there's a time sequence in that

1193
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:05,598
he had sites that were as young as five

1194
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,358
years and the oldest one was about 45

1195
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:11,599
years and he saw this kind of linear of

1196
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,159
accumulation of carbon over time and

1197
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,000
nitrogen over time in those residential

1198
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,639
areas now it would have been nice if he

1199
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,199
would have been able to go out another

1200
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:23,838
40 years or so to see if this continues

1201
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:26,159
but there definitely was over time and

1202
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,400
a fair amount of sequestration of both

1203
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,719
carbon and nitrogen in these residential

1204
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,599
soils

1205
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,679
the difference occurred primarily

1206
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,800
primarily in the top 70 centimeters of

1207
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:40,960
the soil we can see with carbon

1208
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,359
the 10 to 70 centimeter zone this is

1209
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,519
where the the major increase significant

1210
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:48,159
increase occurred compared to the four

1211
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,838
soils in nitrogen it's the top 70

1212
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,759
centimeters even at the surface 10

1213
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:54,239
centimeters that had higher in the

1214
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,839
residential area than forested area

1215
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,239
and

1216
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,358
and the percent carbon uh was slightly

1217
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:00,959
higher

1218
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,279
again in the residential area than in

1219
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,318
the forested area at at most depths

1220
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,400
except for the deepest sample

1221
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:10,480
and so we did a mass balance in these

1222
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,280
areas and and

1223
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,119
and and kind of adding that up um he was

1224
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,240
able to conclude from this and i'll put

1225
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,240
his his concluding statement up here

1226
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,559
that these data suggest that soils in

1227
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:25,439
residential areas on formal agricultural

1228
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,759
land so these were suburbs that were

1229
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,240
taken farms over had a significant

1230
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,400
capacity to sequester nitrogen

1231
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:36,318
and carbon following development in this

1232
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,880
case for 40 they had data for 45 years

1233
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,358
given the the large area of these soils

1234
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,039
they are undoubtedly a significant

1235
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:44,799
significant regional

1236
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:49,440
carbon and nitrogen

1237
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,440
balances as a form of sequestration

1238
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:52,960
okay

1239
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,079
perfect

1240
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,679
final thoughts after 35 years

1241
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,318
being here plus

1242
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:03,679
this was my first seminar

1243
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:04,880
36 years ago in december and bill that's

1244
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:07,838
what i want to point out you see this

1245
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,760
rose i had a rose tie on when i came in

1246
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:11,440
the department i was in floriculture and

1247
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,119
ornamental horticulture a lot of rose

1248
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,480
guys so i think the reason i got this

1249
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,480
job is i had this tie on build

1250
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:20,078
geez

1251
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,480
most people have not seen me without a

1252
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,318
beard so this is pretty cool you know

1253
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,679
and here you know those are two good

1254
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:27,679
things

1255
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,440
so those of you young faculty that want

1256
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,759
to complain about startup costs this is

1257
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,920
what you got back in 1979 i got a five

1258
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,000
thousand dollar hatch grant with

1259
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,960
inflation is now seventeen thousand

1260
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,039
dollars

1261
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,880
the dean said two years ago the average

1262
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,679
startup uh

1263
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,160
package for a faculty member in cals is

1264
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:48,399
over eight hundred thousand dollars okay

1265
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:51,519
so you young faculty think you have it

1266
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,200
hard no technicians no post docs no grad

1267
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,639
students a whopping five thousand

1268
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:57,279
dollars a year and seventeen thousand

1269
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,118
dollars in in today's funds so just to

1270
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,359
just remind you people

1271
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,760
okay uh when i first came we had

1272
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:06,880
mainframes with punch cards there were

1273
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,880
no pcs

1274
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,280
smartphones we didn't even have i had a

1275
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,679
party line phone with two other faculty

1276
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,400
members and extension with a light on it

1277
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:15,679
so

1278
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,920
when that light was on somebody's

1279
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,358
talking on the phone so a guy george

1280
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,920
good who was a

1281
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:23,838
nursery landscape person more than 50

1282
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,400
extension i was 50 extension of bob

1283
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:28,480
kozlowski it was 100 extension it put

1284
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,920
three of us on the same line it was a it

1285
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,358
was a fight every time that light went

1286
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,318
off everybody was grabbing for their

1287
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:36,799
phone so technology has changed over my

1288
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:38,960
career

1289
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,119
but i want to thank people

1290
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,039
who i've worked with over the years my

1291
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,119
first technician was ron white some of

1292
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,800
you do know ron he was a phenomenal

1293
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,640
engineer he was a turf guy but he was

1294
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,800
probably the best engineer i knew

1295
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,639
john gowan chris sancherico howard

1296
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,318
piddick jeff barlow my current

1297
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,400
technician back there

1298
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,880
i left alexis

1299
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,519
heinz off this list

1300
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,039
she was a an asset for for a good asset

1301
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,039
for a couple of years

1302
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,880
then some of my previous colleagues norm

1303
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:09,279
hummel was here on the faculty and and

1304
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,519
joanne grutaderia who we still hire from

1305
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,119
time to time

1306
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,960
some more current ones and i don't have

1307
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,039
a picture of jenny and

1308
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,039
and kyle wicken but some of our people

1309
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,119
such as frank and jennifer grant in the

1310
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:22,719
middle here and field staff and other

1311
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,800
ipm people

1312
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,639
it's been kind of great

1313
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,318
you know working with everybody

1314
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:29,838
but the grad students are always the

1315
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,000
best and

1316
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:33,199
this is the list that i was able to work

1317
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,719
with over

1318
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:38,639
35 plus years they were good things so

1319
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:43,799
there's a just grass hopefully maybe a

1320
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:43,799
little more so with that thank you

1321
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,079
new jersey is the most recent one

1322
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,318
pennsylvania is right in the middle of i

1323
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,599
don't know where they've passed theirs

1324
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:57,920
new jersey

1325
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,240
is called the most restrictive but

1326
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,880
they're again they they all have that at

1327
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,799
least for phosphorus have that similar

1328
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,480
problem connecticut didn't do it there

1329
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,760
were kind of two things in these laws

1330
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,119
that were done

1331
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,200
one did they exempt organic fertilizers

1332
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,680
which

1333
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,519
or or fertilizers that come from compost

1334
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:18,879
that's one of the other kind of caveats

1335
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:20,880
and it's like

1336
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,559
excuse me

1337
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,000
eventually that phosphorus or nitrogen

1338
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,400
is going to be released out of those and

1339
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
so it's it was mostly that's that's the

1340
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,760
politics they're saying what we produce

1341
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,039
especially municipally produced all

1342
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,640
these compost what the heck we're going

1343
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,880
to do what if we ban it because they all

1344
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:38,239
would be banned under that under the

1345
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,160
definition so so they decided okay maybe

1346
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,399
there's not really that much used and it

1347
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:44,719
may not be a big problem but that uh but

1348
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,880
that but but new jersey i think their

1349
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:49,199
law is pretty good but it does have they

1350
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,280
all have a little bit of twist to it

1351
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,118
unfortunately that's why i wish frank

1352
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,920
were here actually frank has done some

1353
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,838
of those studies

1354
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,519
yeah his i mean his work and he was

1355
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,519
looking mostly from a golf course

1356
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,119
perspective which is probably the most

1357
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:06,079
one of the most intense ones because of

1358
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,240
mowing and and inputs and so there is

1359
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,079
net accumulation you know so that even

1360
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:11,358
though there is you do have to mow them

1361
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,519
and you have fertilizer you have

1362
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:15,920
irrigation all those all those you know

1363
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:17,920
those carbon versions they do get the

1364
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,440
the net accumulation is greater than

1365
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,519
those inputs

1366
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,159
so it's outweighed by those

1367
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:26,079
and um and and it's it's an area i think

1368
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:27,679
somebody should should do a lot more

1369
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,359
work in um

1370
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:31,199
but it it you know that when you had a

1371
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:33,199
look at the bigger picture but but frank

1372
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:35,039
had done a little bit of that work

1373
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,879
well it's a great question because the

1374
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,838
next study that was done we're just

1375
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,240
finishing we're finishing up did that we

1376
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:44,558
took well we kept the traditional high

1377
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,399
input kentucky bluegrass version we

1378
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,880
looked at low maintenance grasses tall

1379
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,280
fescue and fine fescue with and without

1380
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,599
clover in those and so that's the that

1381
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,440
was like the and and or only maintained

1382
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,838
organically with organic products so

1383
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,559
that's the the next generation of these

1384
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:02,639
things and and

1385
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,280
the the take-home is after a while they

1386
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:07,598
all perform very similarly the losses

1387
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,280
are they they end up being low

1388
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,640
uh because you you do have an

1389
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,240
establishment

1390
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,558
if you take that establishment period

1391
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,879
out once you get a once you get density

1392
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,200
with these things and actually

1393
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,640
in some of the years because we have a

1394
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:22,719
three years and i haven't seen the third

1395
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,639
year but in some of the years actually

1396
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:27,039
the low maintenance fine fescue with

1397
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:29,598
clover was the worst

1398
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,440
for for losses and i don't know whether

1399
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,079
that's just an aberration or that if

1400
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,559
that's real but if anything the the high

1401
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,240
maintenance one was not worse than those

1402
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,599
other landscapes but that's been the

1403
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:41,199
other a lot of times you'll see

1404
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,200
regulations kind of written around use

1405
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,879
low maintenance grasses and it's not

1406
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:46,639
always the maintenance that's that's the

1407
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,640
issue it's you know it's the it's the

1408
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:50,960
density and what it does

1409
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:53,199
to the really the hydrology of the

1410
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,119
system if it changes that it can

1411
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:57,358
outweigh some of the potential negative

1412
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,358
things and there is a period you get

1413
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:01,358
nitrogen i mean turf is a good nitrogen

1414
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,440
sink phosphorus it really depends what

1415
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:05,119
the soil levels are initially and if you

1416
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,880
put it on at a time when the soils are

1417
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,838
wet you could get a lot of phosphorus

1418
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:12,160
run off there i mean there's a

1419
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:13,440
management component to that for sure

1420
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:15,039
oh good

1421
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,318
so that's probably it i don't think i'm

1422
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:18,318
going to give another seminar dot

1423
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:21,039
thank you

1424
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,680
that is a more important one

1425
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,480
thank you this has been a production of

1426
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:33,480
cornell university on the web at

1427
