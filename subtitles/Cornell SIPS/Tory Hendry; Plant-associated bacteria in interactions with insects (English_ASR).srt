00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,878
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,039
University. Thank you. Thanks for the

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,320
introduction and uh thank you all for

4
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,719
inviting me to come and give your

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,719
seminar. Um I'm really happy to be here

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:21,439
and interact with more of you. I'm not a

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,960
plant pathologist, but as Melanie said,

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,518
a lot of the work that I've been doing

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,599
is focused on plant pathogens even on a

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:30,079
string day um in interactions with

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,879
insects. So it's it's nice to be able to

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,039
go over here and track all of

13
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:38,320
them. Um so work in the lab and my

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,640
interest in general is fairly broad. I'm

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,159
interested in the evolution and ecology

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,159
of bacteria interacting with hosts.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:54,719
Yeah. Is is the position that's up here?

18
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,960
Um, in particular, I'm interested in how

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,399
the bacterial genome content, gene

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,120
content connects to interactions with

21
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,840
different hosts or in different

22
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,959
environments. Um, and in

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,478
particular, this is interesting for

24
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,039
bacteria that interact with multiple

25
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,640
hosts or in multiple environments. And

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,200
so that might be in different abiotic

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,799
environments or bacteria that interact

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,960
with a host and then also in other

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,240
abiotic environments.

30
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,919
And as many of you know, uh, summon is a

31
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,759
really good example of that because it

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,799
does, um, inhabit a lot of different

33
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,560
environments. Of course, it's very well

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,840
studied as a plant pathogen for good

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,159
reason. It's a very common plant

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,000
pathogen, um, that likely infects

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,920
possibly every plant or nearly every

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,478
plant species.

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,519
is also a serious agricultural um

40
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,920
pathogen uh that can cause uh serious

41
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,399
agricultural losses such as in bacterial

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,240
speck of tomato or kiwi canker or

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,960
different um highly virulent strains

44
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,359
that affect plants.

45
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,839
But in addition to that aspect of the

46
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,840
bacterial ecology,

47
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,560
um sen or what we what we call saring is

48
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,159
a very diverse group of strains that um

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,920
none of a lot of which are not very

50
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,598
closely related to each other and can

51
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,839
inhabit a lot of different habitat. So

52
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,878
it can be more of uh what we think of as

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,878
an environmental

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,039
bacteria. Um they can be found in leaf

55
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,238
litter and particular in the water

56
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,679
cycle. So it can be present in lakes and

57
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,560
rivers and actually rises up into the

58
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,680
atmosphere via evaporation and

59
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,159
transpiration. Um and it's thought to be

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,239
a major nucleator in a biological

61
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,400
nucleator and clouds uh which forms

62
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,759
precipitation and it falls back down. So

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,920
it can be very common in those

64
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,079
environments. Um, ceramia can also be

65
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,679
common on plants without causing disease

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,680
either because it's on a plant that's

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,920
not a compatible host or because it's

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,519
simply epithetic on the surfaces of of

69
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,839
plants and we think it's in this context

70
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,920
where epithetic populations of bacteria

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,479
are on plant surfaces that it might be

72
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,639
interacting with plant associated

73
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,039
insects. So a couple of years before I

74
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,359
started my postto work on this um there

75
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,359
was one paper showing that some serene

76
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,239
strains could actually infect grow

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,760
within and then kill

78
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,599
a so kind of adding one additional

79
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,598
habitat to this already kind of

80
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,679
impressive list um that potentially

81
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,598
survey could be using aphids as an

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,200
additional uh additional

83
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:29,039
host and a lot of my postto work was

84
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,000
focused on these two questions kind of

85
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,719
defining what the effects of um the

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,878
bacteria on the insect hosts work and

87
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,919
also because of my interest in trying to

88
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,518
connect genomes to bacterial ecology to

89
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,679
figure out what the genomic basis for

90
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,439
these interactions actually is. Um, and

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,959
I'll be presenting mostly this work

92
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:51,039
today and getting in a little bit to the

93
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,840
direction that I'm going now um as we're

94
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,519
starting up work here in the lab just

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,280
putting this in a broader context and

96
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,120
understanding how these interactions

97
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,080
with insects could actually be um

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,080
impacting bacterial populations.

99
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,560
So most of the work that I've been doing

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,479
has been focusing on conctor insects uh

101
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,080
such as aphids and white flies. So these

102
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,079
are floam feeding insects. So they

103
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,680
insert their kind of straw-like mouth

104
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,160
parts into plants and feed our plants

105
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,560
out. Um they're also major agricultural

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,160
pests and they because they cause a lot

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,160
of crop damage. Um there's a lot of

108
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,880
interest in finding alternative control

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,479
strategies such as biological control or

110
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,120
bioactive compounds from different

111
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,439
sources that might um be able to control

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,319
those pests. Um so that's partly why

113
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,240
I've been focusing on hemiptrans. Um

114
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,360
I'll mostly talk about pet aphids today

115
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,918
but actually have found fairly similar

116
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,960
effects across different hemran species

117
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:52,240
which is interesting.

118
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,000
So this is showing survival of p aphids

119
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,759
and white flies that have been exposed

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,639
to two different strains of sudonus

121
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,240
suring. Um pathopar suring strain

122
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,240
B728a and path of our tomato strain

123
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,478
BC3000. I'm mostly going to be talking

124
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,478
about those strains today. So um you can

125
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,038
kind of keep this pattern in your mind a

126
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,199
little bit. Um so the dashed lines are

127
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,719
white flies and the solid lines are

128
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
aphids and it's showing the proportion

129
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,560
of individuals surviving over time. So,

130
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,879
these individuals have been exposed to

131
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,519
the bacteria in artificial diet. It's a

132
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,560
fake plant sap that they can feed off on

133
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,719
for up to a week without too much um too

134
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,240
much harm to the insect. Um and the

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,479
treatments either were controlled with

136
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,680
just buffer added or uh bacterial

137
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,399
treatments that had a bacterial

138
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,759
suspension added to the

139
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:40,478
diet. And as you can see, the apas and

140
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,919
the white flies have pretty similar uh

141
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:47,120
decreases in survival uh with both of

142
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:50,079
the strains. With B728A, you see a very

143
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,759
virulent response where the insects um

144
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,038
the survival goes down to almost zero

145
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,120
within just a few days. For DC000,

146
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,038
survival is significantly decreased

147
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,720
compared to the controls um but not at

148
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,719
the same rate. It's a lot a lot

149
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:08,560
lower. And I found this to be true not

150
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,478
just in uh p aids and white flies but

151
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,879
also in other hypocr species and other

152
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,879
aphid species. um you see the similar

153
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,439
highly virolent effect with uh with

154
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,600
highly viralent strains. Um and also I

155
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,560
found fairly broad effects across other

156
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,400
unrelated insects. Um so for instance uh

157
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
we did an experiment where we fed lady

158
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,560
beetle larvae with either infected or

159
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,520
uninfected aphids and the lady beetle

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,120
survival was uh decreased on infected

161
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:37,519
aphids and their rate of development was

162
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,280
slow. So it wasn't quite the same. They

163
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,038
weren't it wasn't as viralent as it is

164
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,439
for the winter insects where they were

165
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,079
all dying. Um but there was definitely

166
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,478
an effect. Um we also found an effect in

167
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,399
a lepodopran larvae. So a chewing

168
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,599
herbivore that was eating food that had

169
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,918
uh natural natural numbers of bacteria

170
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,680
in it um where the survival of the

171
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,560
larvae was decreased and development

172
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,720
time um was impaired. So it seems like

173
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,879
there could be fairly broad effects of

174
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,639
sering across different insects.

175
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,639
Although that probably varies depending

176
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,000
on what the insect is. The only insect

177
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,478
that actually haven't been able to find

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,319
an effect for is uh fruit flies.

179
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,439
Drosophila and melanagaster don't care

180
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,598
if you feed tons of suring to them. They

181
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,000
serate doesn't grow and and the flies do

182
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,439
just fine. Um but interestingly all of

183
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,199
these insects of course are things that

184
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,120
would actually be encountering serate on

185
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,680
leaves. So the fact that you see is kind

186
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,680
of significant effect. um is potentially

187
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,840
meaningful and in fact it might be a

188
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,598
fairly broad pattern across other plant

189
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,359
associated bacteria that we just haven't

190
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,360
found yet. Um so there have actually

191
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,319
been four plant pathogens that have been

192
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,840
found to also be pated pathogens. So um

193
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
these other three have very similar

194
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,758
effects to what we see where they grow

195
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,800
inside the insect and can be

196
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,639
highly. So, it's possible that these

197
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,520
plant associated bacteria are actually

198
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,879
common pathogens um to insects, but we

199
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,318
don't really have a handle on how

200
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,319
frequent these interactions actually

201
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:13,439
are. Um and this leads into this uh

202
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,879
broader question of how environmental

203
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:19,519
bacteria actually uh impact and insects.

204
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,039
So mostly insects like aphids are

205
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,639
studied for their intracellular

206
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,279
symbiotics which we know are incredibly

207
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,720
important for for the

208
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,318
insects. Uh but they have fairly limited

209
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,000
microbial communities other than that.

210
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,680
So if you take an aphid surface

211
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
sterilize it and then use culture

212
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,799
dependent or culture independent means

213
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,879
to see what kind of bacteria they have

214
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,199
in their gut. Um you don't find very

215
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,038
much. You find like a few taxa a few

216
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,200
cells typically things that are plant

217
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,958
associated. And people tend to think

218
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,160
that that is because they're feeding at

219
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,719
home. there's just not very much

220
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,000
bacteria there. And these like having a

221
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,160
gut community isn't something that's

222
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,519
important for the

223
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:55,360
insects. There also been few known

224
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,560
bacterial pathogens found other than the

225
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,278
ones that I that I showed you. Um, and

226
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,119
it's not entirely clear if that is

227
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,278
because this is an actual pattern that

228
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,440
these environmental bacteria aren't

229
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,519
interacting with insects that much or if

230
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,080
it's maybe an observation bias. So when

231
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,240
the aphids get infected by sering, they

232
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,920
don't have any obvious symptoms. So, um,

233
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,600
there's a lot of fungal pathogens of

234
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,199
aphids, and you can see when aphids get

235
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,800
infected with fungal pathogens, the

236
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,720
fungus grows out of the aphid, and it's

237
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,240
really obvious. Um, you don't see

238
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,200
anything when they die from bacteria,

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,200
they just kind of peel over and

240
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,040
die. Um, it's also potentially hard to

241
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,360
find the infection in nature, um,

242
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,799
because the aphids are dying so quickly.

243
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,320
So, you need to kind of catch in order

244
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,079
to sample an aphid that would be

245
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,480
infected, you need to catch it before

246
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,879
the bacteria grow too much and and that

247
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,320
aid dies. Um so it may actually be hard

248
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,799
to find if people haven't been

249
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
specifically looking for it. So to kind

250
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,079
of get a sense of how frequent these

251
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,159
interactions might be, we've done some

252
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,839
work in the lab. Um in particular

253
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:57,759
looking at infectivity of senate. So how

254
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,839
many cells does an a need to pick up in

255
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,360
order to become

256
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,440
infected? Um this was an experiment done

257
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,919
by Kelly Clark who was an undergraduate

258
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,600
researcher with me at the University of

259
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:10,079
Arizona. And for this uh this experiment

260
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,440
we used B728A. So we used a highly

261
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,920
viralent strain so that we would be sure

262
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,160
to get a strong effect. Um and we did

263
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,639
the infection in artificial diet so we

264
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:21,120
could control exactly how many bacteria

265
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,159
the aphids were being exposed to. And we

266
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,759
exposed them to varying

267
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,199
doses used second and third instar

268
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,159
aphids. So these are aphids that are

269
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,399
still developing. They're not

270
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,719
reproductive yet. Um so that means that

271
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,440
they aren't uh they're not getting the

272
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,519
added variable reproducing. They're not

273
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,519
playing with the results. Um, so we

274
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,440
infected them for 24 hours and then we

275
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,360
tracked them for an additional 5 days.

276
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,640
Uh, put them on sterile diet. So now

277
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,440
they they've been infected and they're

278
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:51,120
just on diet with sterile and we tracked

279
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,880
their survival. At the end we um we

280
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,720
tested to make sure that we knew exactly

281
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,480
what the bacterial dose was. So we

282
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,959
tested the the diet that they've been

283
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,480
feeding on and we also took a proportion

284
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,838
of some of the individuals and sampled

285
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
them for infection to find out what

286
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,880
proportion were actually infected.

287
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,920
And this was replicated three times with

288
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,639
uh 30 to 40 agents in each treatment at

289
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,919
each rep. It's a lot of a lot of dead

290
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,838
agents. Um and it turns out that

291
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,679
mortality is dose dependent which is

292
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,240
kind of what you would expect. Higher

293
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:26,679
doses lead to higher mortality. This is

294
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,839
the probability of survival and over

295
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,838
time and the likelihood of infection um

296
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,720
also increased with the bacterial dose.

297
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,600
So higher doses and this is a the log of

298
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,560
the bacterial dose um led to a higher

299
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,560
proportion of infected

300
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,160
individuals and the higher infection

301
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,480
likelihood led to decreased survival

302
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,639
significantly decreased survival. So

303
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,480
that means that the mortality is

304
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,399
actually correlated with the chance of

305
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,920
the likelihood of infection. So rather

306
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:58,958
than it's not the number of cells that

307
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,399
you're picking up that matters but

308
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,479
whether you become infected. If you

309
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,839
become infected, you will probably

310
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,600
die. And in fact, it seems that you can

311
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,399
become infected with a very low number

312
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,320
of cells. Um, so here we have the

313
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,360
proportion surviving again over the

314
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,480
proportion infected. And each point is

315
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,000
um a different dose and we calculated

316
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,240
the number of cells that these aphids

317
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,240
likely ingested based on how much they

318
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,480
were feeding and what the dose was. Um,

319
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,200
so the blue line is the control

320
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,680
survival. These are all doses that

321
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,079
didn't significantly alter the survival.

322
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,958
And the red dots are all doses that

323
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,399
significantly decrease survival of the

324
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:40,559
insects. Um, so in these two cases,

325
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,399
these two doses, the aphits were likely

326
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,958
only ingesting one to nine cells, but

327
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,958
yet had significant decreased survival.

328
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,359
Um, and this is actually in keeping with

329
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,199
what was found in another system in

330
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,120
Dikia, uh, where they used different

331
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
methods to figure out what the effective

332
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,120
the minimum effective dose was. And they

333
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,958
also found it to be about 10 cells. So

334
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,039
if the agents then get infected with

335
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,359
even a small number of bacteria, those

336
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,719
can grow and they die. And of course,

337
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,320
this is definitely in keeping with the

338
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,759
number of cells that you would like to

339
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,760
find on a leaf, which kind of puts this

340
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,240
in more of an eological context,

341
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,159
suggesting that this would be something

342
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,399
that's actually happening. Um, we've

343
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,120
also done experiments on plants uh

344
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,720
testing the same idea. So here the

345
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,879
plants themselves were sprayed with

346
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,560
different uh tigers and bacteria and

347
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,159
then the aphids were introduced onto the

348
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,919
plants that had been infected on the

349
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,519
plant. Um and at the end of the time we

350
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,958
counted the survival of the aphids at

351
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,399
the end of the time we quantified the

352
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:38,319
number of bacteria that were on the

353
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,958
leaves. So at the um when populations

354
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,720
were at 10^ the 4 or 10^ the 6 colony

355
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,679
forming units per leaflet this is on

356
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:50,600
lava plants um there was significantly

357
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:52,958
decreased survival of the a

358
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,079
um yeah so these are numbers these are

359
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,679
population numbers that you could

360
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,679
actually find on leaves in nature. This

361
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,879
is certainly some this was done in a

362
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,519
greenhouse but it's certainly something

363
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,600
that you could imagine happening in

364
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,839
nature and in fact we see um infection

365
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,920
rates on plants of about 10 to 30% of

366
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,199
aphids um becoming infected depending on

367
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,958
the conditions. So, it's somewhat a

368
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,479
significant effect here where a lot of

369
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,799
the aphids are potentially getting

370
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,440
infected, suggesting um that this could

371
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,679
be common in

372
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,600
nature. And it raises the question of if

373
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,719
there's these highly virulent pathogens

374
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,240
out there that they're encountering

375
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,519
frequently, what are the aphids doing to

376
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,519
defend themselves against this

377
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,120
infection? Uh we haven't done anything

378
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,199
with aphid immunity. Aphids are thought

379
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,278
to have a reduced immunity compared to a

380
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,278
lot of other insects. they have a lower

381
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,919
number of immune function genes in their

382
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,198
genomes and uh for a lot of pathogens

383
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,198
they don't really mount as much of

384
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,078
immune system compared to what we expect

385
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,439
to find based on other systems like um

386
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,638
so it's kind of thought that aphids

387
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,160
maybe don't respond imunologically um

388
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,639
it's thought that maybe they have more

389
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:04,360
varied non-immunological defenses and so

390
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,759
we've mostly focused on that and one um

391
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,440
possibility is symbi mediated immunity

392
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,120
so intracellular symbions can be

393
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,800
defensive against pathogens. They can

394
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,639
help the the insect um survive pathogen

395
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,278
infection and we found some evidence for

396
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,720
that actually in white

397
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:22,519
flies. Uh but another possibility that

398
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,040
we were interested in is fat

399
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,519
decompensation. So fat decompensation is

400
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:31,039
when there's a reproductive response to

401
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,879
to an infection. Um and in theory

402
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,198
individuals can invest in reproduction

403
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,519
over investing in immunity. Um and that

404
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,039
might be favored when a pathogen is

405
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,198
highly viralent. So, if you're not going

406
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,879
to survive an infection, um there might

407
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,719
be no point in trying to fight it off.

408
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,320
Um and maybe you should invest less of

409
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,720
your resources in just reproducing as

410
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,120
much as you can before you die. Um

411
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,000
particularly if you are an organism that

412
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,078
reproduce a lot. So, aphids are asexual

413
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,519
and have really high uh reproductive

414
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,599
ability. So, maybe it makes sense for

415
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,000
them to be able to to invest in defense

416
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,000
in that way.

417
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,959
Um so to test this we set up an

418
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,278
experiment uh similar to the one with

419
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:12,799
B728A that we described

420
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:14,879
before. Um except this time we used

421
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,399
DC3000 because it's a lower viralent

422
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:17,919
strain so it doesn't kill the insects as

423
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,240
quickly so we could actually follow them

424
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,278
long enough to wash them to reproduce.

425
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,440
Um so again the insects were infected in

426
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,078
artificial diet using different tighters

427
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,839
of bacteria. um except after they were

428
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,758
infected, we put them on plants so they

429
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,240
could kind of be happy as happy as an

430
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,079
infected acre can be. Um and we tracked

431
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,360
their survival, development time, and

432
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,399
reproductive rate over the course of a

433
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,159
week. And I'm just going to give you the

434
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,720
answer to what happens to survival and

435
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,719
development time. Um for survival, it

436
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,240
was dose dependent as we saw with the

437
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,800
other strains. So with higher doses,

438
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,639
more more aphids died. Um there was no

439
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,799
effect on development time. they reached

440
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,600
adulthood um equally fast if they were

441
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:00,078
infected or if there was a lower dose.

442
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,839
But we did see an interesting um effect

443
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:05,599
on reproductive

444
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,880
rate. So this is showing the number of

445
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:11,279
offspring per apid per day um and

446
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,839
bacterial concentration the log of the

447
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,160
bacterial concentration on the x-axis.

448
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,879
So, uh, each point is a different

449
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,480
replica, the name of the replica, and we

450
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,120
had three replicates, and these are the

451
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,959
control doses for all of those. They're

452
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,519
all kind of clustered up here. They're

453
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,640
fairly similar in reproduction. Um, the

454
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,558
extremely high doses are uh over here.

455
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,000
Mostly those aphids died before they got

456
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,960
a chance to reproduce. So, that's why

457
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,798
those numbers are so low. And with the

458
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,798
remaining points, you see a significant

459
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,480
positive correlation. So there's

460
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,119
actually a decrease in reproductive rate

461
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,038
with very low doses and then an increase

462
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,079
in reproductive rate with high doses.

463
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:53,359
And these rates are actually higher than

464
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,199
the control rates. So this suggests that

465
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,199
maybe there is some kind of cost to

466
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,000
infection. They might be lowering their

467
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,679
reproductive ability here. Um but

468
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,119
possibly they're then increasing that

469
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,519
reproductive rate to counter the

470
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,239
infection at or the cost of the

471
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:11,918
infection um as they go up as the dose

472
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,880
goes up. And when you look at that um if

473
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,559
you look at the means um of the

474
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,559
reproductive rate and you kind of break

475
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,240
the doses down into low, medium, high,

476
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:21,839
you can see that a little bit better.

477
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,359
None of these reproductive rates are

478
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,399
actually significantly different from

479
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,199
the control. Um but you can see the the

480
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,200
increase with the dose and also the fact

481
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,600
that the low dose actually has a

482
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,720
significantly different um reproductive

483
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,000
rate than the high dose. There's

484
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,319
definitely something different happening

485
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,319
with this low dose than the high dose.

486
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,360
And that's particularly striking when

487
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,880
you look at the survival of the aphids

488
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,240
um at the same time. So this is the

489
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,880
percent number of aphids that are

490
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,000
surviving um on day seven. So that's the

491
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,760
point when all of the aphids have

492
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,759
started reproducing. So at these high

493
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,279
doses, there's less than 20% aphids

494
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,798
actually surviving, but they're really

495
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,038
reproducing at a rate that's higher than

496
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:01,038
the

497
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,360
controls. And we think um that the

498
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,960
mechanism here might be that those

499
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,678
aphids that were exposed to the high

500
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,679
dose, so the the black circles are

501
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,840
reproducing faster than the than the

502
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,320
other a. So here they're uh there's a

503
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:19,439
peak of reproduction actually at day six

504
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,678
after infection. Um and then that starts

505
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,160
to go down whereas the control aphids

506
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,640
the uh the open circles are just kind of

507
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,038
starting to ramp up reproduction. So

508
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,720
they might be kind of increasing the

509
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,879
timing of that reproduction to counter

510
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,440
the infection once it starts to get

511
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,520
starts to get bad. So this is some

512
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,759
suggestion that aphids may actually be

513
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:45,400
reacting to uh to viral infection with

514
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:48,558
decompensation. Um we also have been

515
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,000
exploring another potential uh defense

516
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,119
which would be avoidance. So if there

517
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,480
are these strains out there that are

518
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,319
highly viralent it would make sense that

519
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,839
the aphids would um or insects in

520
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,839
general would evolve to avoid them.

521
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,960
So this was work that was actually done

522
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,640
by an REU student in the lab here,

523
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,319
Rachel Fay, an RU student for the

524
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,080
microbial friends and pro programs in

525
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,678
the summer. Um we're really excited

526
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,879
about how well this worked out. Rachel

527
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,320
was able to do three different

528
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,880
experiments um looking at how Singa

529
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,720
influenced a feeding. So in the first

530
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,440
experiment, she looked at feeding rates

531
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,839
on artificial diet uh with or without

532
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,759
different bacterial strains or control

533
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,918
and no choice. So in this case, the

534
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,319
apits were in um in a setup where all

535
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,720
they had access to was a feeding sache.

536
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,038
Um and it either was a control or had

537
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,960
bacterial suspensions in it and they

538
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,759
either had a choice to feed or not feed.

539
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,600
And she followed them for 24 hours,

540
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,240
checking every few hours to see how many

541
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,000
were eating. In a separate experiment,

542
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,480
she looked at feeding preference. So in

543
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,919
this setup, the aphids were given three

544
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,480
different choices. It was actually in a

545
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,919
96 well plate. So each well could be a

546
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,480
different a different choice, a

547
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,320
different bacterial strain or control.

548
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,120
And the aphids were free to roam around

549
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:02,798
and go wherever they were. Um and she

550
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,839
looked again at how many aphids were

551
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:07,038
feeding uh over

552
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,480
time. And of course what we're most

553
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,720
interested in is whether this actually

554
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,919
works on plants. Um so we also did an

555
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,000
experiment where they were given a

556
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,200
choice of feeding um they were on plants

557
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,038
and they're given a choice of feed on

558
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,759
leaves that had bacteria or didn't have

559
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,038
bacteria. And this has been done on fava

560
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,759
plants which are actually a really nice

561
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,919
setup for that because as the as the

562
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,440
leaves kind of unfurl uh each leaf is

563
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,400
composed of two leaflets that are about

564
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,880
the same size. So we painted one leaflet

565
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,038
with epithetic bacteria and the other we

566
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,559
painted with a control and let those dry

567
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,400
and then we introduced aphids onto the

568
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,079
plant and let them make their choice. Um

569
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,480
and we counted them over the course of

570
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,480
several days.

571
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,558
So we did find an effect of B728A on the

572
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,038
on aphid feeding. So this is the

573
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:55,359
proportion of aphids in each cup that

574
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,400
are that are feeding um either on

575
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:02,079
control diet diet with B728A or diet

576
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,880
with DC3000. Um the control and BC3000

577
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:08,480
were the same number of kids feeding but

578
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,880
B728A was significantly less. And you

579
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,640
can see that in the um in the control in

580
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,760
BC pretty much all of the aids are

581
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,080
feeding at any given time whereas B78A

582
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,599
only about 30 to 40% would be feeding at

583
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,639
any given observation

584
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,000
point. And this holds up when you

585
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,960
actually give them a choice between

586
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,558
different uh different treatments as

587
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:32,880
well. So and here there was less feeding

588
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,240
on DCU 2000 compared to the control

589
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,480
although it wasn't significantly

590
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,359
different. Um, and there was almost no

591
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,440
feeding at all on areas that had

592
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,879
B728A. You might notice that there's

593
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,960
kind of a lower there's definitely a

594
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,720
lower uh rate of feeding overall here

595
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,480
compared to what I just showed you where

596
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,759
almost all of the aphids are feeding.

597
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,319
Um, here only I think about 40% were

598
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,839
feeding at any given time. Um, it might

599
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,439
this might be a difference just in the

600
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,599
experimental setup. These were in a

601
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,759
different container um that was bigger.

602
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,359
It might also be because they have this

603
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,798
had more places that didn't actually

604
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,479
have food and so they had to like move

605
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,400
around and search for places that did

606
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,000
have food. So they may have just had

607
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,320
less time that they were able to spend

608
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,720
feeding. Um that might actually be an

609
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:19,079
effect of them being kind of being able

610
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,600
to experience both the control and the

611
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:23,359
bacteria. Potentially if they found the

612
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,879
spot initially that had bacteria in it

613
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,798
and then they didn't want to feed there,

614
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,400
they might move on and try to find other

615
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:31,918
places and just again spend more time

616
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,400
moving around less time feeding.

617
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,080
Um, we at the end of this experiment, we

618
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,240
also wanted to confirm that they that

619
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,319
these these results looked right by

620
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,839
testing to see how if the if they became

621
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,119
infected from from that feeding that

622
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:47,279
they were doing. Um, we found a low rate

623
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,959
of infection by BC3000 which matches

624
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,399
what we're seeing. And actually, Rachel

625
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,079
didn't find any aphits that were

626
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,400
infected with B720 a day. Um, I should

627
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,158
say that our ability to detect a very

628
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,600
low infection if there were just like a

629
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,880
few cells in the infant is pretty

630
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,639
limited because, you know, we grind it

631
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,919
up and plate it out and if there were

632
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,640
just a couple of cells, we could miss

633
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,240
those. Um, but I think this it's

634
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,520
striking in that it matches these

635
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,960
results really well. And it also

636
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,519
suggests that maybe the aphids are

637
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,600
actually actively avoiding the virulent

638
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,400
strain. um because it's not clear to me

639
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,038
necessarily if they might become

640
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,640
infected with B728A really quickly and

641
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,200
then stop feeding because they're

642
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,600
infected and kind of unhealthy or if

643
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,120
they're actually um they encounter B7 28

644
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,119
and then they try to avoid that food

645
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,679
altogether. And then um I'm going to

646
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,200
show the results of our um plant

647
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,798
experiment. Um this is kind of

648
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,120
preliminary. We've only done this once

649
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,558
and so I'm not I'm not saying that I

650
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,959
believe it necessarily at this point,

651
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:48,720
but it is in keeping with what we have

652
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,679
found um in that the um there were at

653
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,278
least twice as many aphids feeding on

654
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,440
leaves without bacteria compared to

655
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,200
leaves with bacteria. And this is over

656
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,600
the course of several days. So these

657
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,960
numbers are fairly consistent. Um which

658
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,639
makes sense. The aids don't really move

659
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,240
around very much once they settle. But

660
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,520
it seems that they were making some kind

661
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,919
of choice initially. Um and there's this

662
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,558
defense here. So, uh I like these

663
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,960
results. They're suggesting in keeping

664
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:15,798
with this idea that there are um broad

665
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,159
and

666
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:21,759
potentially very virulent effects on the

667
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,440
insects. The fact that um insects die

668
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,278
very quickly from this infection and you

669
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,519
find um effects on other insects as

670
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,440
well. Um and also we're finding that

671
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,679
there might be effects on more

672
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,440
complicated insect behavior such as

673
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,960
reproduction or feeding behavior and

674
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,240
things that we care about because also

675
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,000
those affect plants. Um, and I'd like to

676
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,599
be able to uh I'm going to continue

677
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,919
exploring these ideas a bit more and

678
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,079
getting a better sense on what exactly

679
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,759
those effects

680
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:49,599
are. But I'm also interested in being

681
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:53,879
able to figure out what the genomic

682
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,879
basis of these interactions is.

683
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,400
Um and so this question has been looked

684
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:06,480
at in suring for aphid for insect viral

685
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,640
in a couple of different ways. In the

686
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,319
initial work that paper initially came

687
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,400
out um saffron at all had done assays

688
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,319
with transposon mutants. So they had

689
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,120
screened a number of transposon mutants

690
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,639
to look for attenuated virolence. Um and

691
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,319
they weren't able to find something that

692
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,640
was a virolence factor that seemed to

693
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,000
have a a significant effect on viralence

694
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,919
but they did find that knocking out

695
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,119
swarming motility and suring um impacted

696
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,480
viralence. So that might be important in

697
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,918
some way. Um we've also tried some

698
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,519
targeted knocking out of genes that look

699
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,559
like they might be insect toxins. So

700
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:44,240
Sering has homalogues of genes that are

701
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:47,359
known insect toxins from rapidness. Um

702
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,359
and knocking those out has no effect. We

703
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,959
also I just started kind of screening

704
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,439
all of the mutants that I could get my

705
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,519
hands on um that were mostly mutants for

706
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,400
uh regulators of plant virulence and

707
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,679
found no effect there either. And um as

708
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,679
you'll see in a second there doesn't

709
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,320
seem to be um a relationship between

710
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,080
viral plants and the insects. So it's

711
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,000
something different happening in those

712
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,240
two

713
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,960
cases. So this because these these

714
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,720
approaches weren't really working. Um I

715
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,720
tried a different tried a different way

716
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,798
of getting at this. um in this case

717
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,278
using the fact that there are a large

718
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,319
number of sequenced suring genomes and a

719
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:26,480
lot of phenotypic variation between

720
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:28,879
strains to do a genomewide association

721
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,839
study. Um so the idea here is that you

722
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,840
would have strains with sequence genomes

723
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,918
that vary in varants some that have high

724
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,038
varance and some that have low varance.

725
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,759
Um take all of their protein uh coding

726
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:45,278
sequences and cluster those into cogs

727
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:48,158
into clusters of homologous groups. um

728
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:50,240
and then look to see what cogs are

729
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,400
present in each strain and how that

730
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,240
correlates with their virulence. So you

731
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,399
would do a correlation between the

732
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,640
strain phenotype, in this case viral,

733
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:03,439
and the abundance of uh genes in a cog

734
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,679
that each strain has. So I'm going to

735
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,159
present the results of this work today.

736
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,038
It's somewhat preliminary in that I um I

737
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,559
only have 12 strains that I've included,

738
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,240
but it's kind of a proof of concept that

739
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,000
this is something that we can do and

740
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,599
hopefully um I'll be able to expand and

741
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,640
have more strains and get a better idea

742
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:23,119
of what's actually happening here. Um in

743
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,000
order to to screen the strains, we

744
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,678
screened 14 strains that had sequence

745
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,398
genomes and actually screened them in

746
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,120
white flies for neurons. Um so these

747
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:36,319
strains are a pretty broad uh swap

748
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,000
across the suring genogyny including I

749
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,480
think some strains that are no longer

750
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,480
classified as sering. Um so there's

751
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,558
definitely a lot of foggenetic breath

752
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,640
here.

753
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:48,240
Um, and I'm going to show you viralance

754
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,919
data for all of these strains just so

755
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,599
you can get a sense of how that varies

756
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,679
across strains, but I actually only

757
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,359
included strains in the analysis for

758
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,200
which I had three replica assays for

759
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,278
viral so I can have a very good idea of

760
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,679
exactly how virilent um the strains

761
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:06,398
are and as you can see it varies quite a

762
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,720
bit. Um so that the most virulent

763
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:12,000
strains are of course B728A which we

764
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,159
talked about before and actually two

765
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,480
strains that aren't plant pathogens uh

766
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,559
TLB2 and S7. So that's why I think that

767
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,278
virance of insects isn't necessarily

768
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,440
related to viral and plants. Um this

769
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,278
group of strains in general tend to be

770
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,798
more viralent whereas a lot of other

771
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:30,720
strains um can be less virant. Um, I

772
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,519
should say that viralance here, I'm

773
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,319
measuring it as the time that it takes

774
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,480
for the bacteria to significantly

775
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,158
decrease survival compared to controls.

776
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,839
So, pretty much all of the strains will

777
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,520
infect and then eventually kill the

778
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:47,359
aphids. Um, and what kind of differs is

779
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,038
how quickly that happens. So, this is

780
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,558
just one measure of virulence. You could

781
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,000
do it in different ways, kind of the

782
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,480
total number that are dead at different

783
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,679
times or whatever. Um, and I've tried

784
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,120
looking at viralins in different

785
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,480
measuring it in different ways. that way

786
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,038
you get kind of the same results

787
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,120
regardless. So, um I just like this

788
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,960
method because you can like you can more

789
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:08,558
easily compare across

790
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,319
strains. So, taking this data, taking

791
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,639
all of the the strains for which I had

792
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:16,079
good viralance data for, um I clustered

793
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,720
the protein sequences um using or MCL

794
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:21,359
and then did a correlation of the number

795
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,399
of genes in each cog with the virolence

796
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,879
of a of a given strain. And so this the

797
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,719
idea here is to identify candidate genes

798
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,159
that are correlated with virulence

799
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,000
either because they're present in highly

800
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,000
virulent strains and absent in low

801
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,839
virance strains or they might be high

802
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
um more copies in high virolent strains

803
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:43,839
than there are in low vir

804
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
strains and what you get this is some

805
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:49,359
example patterns that you see for some

806
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,640
of the most highly correlated uh

807
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:55,918
um if this is the number of copies of

808
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,080
each co of a cog across the strain going

809
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,640
down into columns. So you see cases

810
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,398
where highly viralent strains like sit

811
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,200
seven might have multiple copies of a

812
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,479
gene. Um and a lot of cases where the

813
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,080
low viral strains of course have no

814
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,440
copies.

815
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:14,398
Um, and when you actually look to see

816
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,080
what those genes are, the list of

817
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:17,678
candidate genes, unfortunately, a large

818
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,678
number of them are hypothetical proteins

819
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,519
with unknown function. Um, so I can't

820
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,360
really say very much about that. There

821
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,359
was one regulatory gene, a transcription

822
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:29,199
um transcription regulator that might be

823
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,519
interesting if that's uh changing

824
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,759
transcription across strains. Um, there

825
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,918
was a chemotaxis gene, a signal

826
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,720
transaction protein uh that I was

827
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,880
interested in because uh sense that

828
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,440
motility potentially is important for

829
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,799
for the virance. Um, and then a couple

830
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,159
of other genes

831
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:49,679
that we know their function, but it's

832
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,320
not entirely clear how that might be

833
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,159
related to viralins. Um, and in fact,

834
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:55,519
these are these are genes that are

835
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,640
correlated with virilence in this

836
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,558
analysis, but it doesn't mean that

837
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,360
they're actually causing the virance.

838
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,558
Um, there is likely I haven't controlled

839
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:07,519
for the phylogenetic signal here. So

840
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,599
these strains are more closely related

841
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,679
and of course more viralent and also

842
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,599
tend to have similar genes in that way.

843
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,440
So there might be an effect there that

844
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,599
that certainly needs to be considered.

845
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,000
Um and of course some of these genes can

846
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,480
be present in these viralent um tax for

847
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,720
other reasons not related to the insect

848
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,000
at all. Um I for instance a lot of the

849
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,079
strains that are highly viralent

850
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,159
especially these that are in group two

851
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,519
are more commonly epipites. They do a

852
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,960
little bit better. It's thought that

853
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,839
they do a little bit better in the

854
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,798
epithetic habitat. That is intriguing

855
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,959
because it means that they're more

856
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,278
likely to encounter the insects. Um, but

857
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,440
it also might just be a coincidence that

858
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:48,159
uh whatever makes you a good appetite

859
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,399
may also make you viralent to insects.

860
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,240
Um, and I I'd like to be able to get at

861
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:53,918
that question of is this just a

862
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,960
coincidence or are these strains

863
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,080
actually adapted for being viralent to

864
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,440
um to

865
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:03,359
insects? And this gets at my larger

866
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,880
question of understanding how these

867
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,398
insect interactions um impact surate

868
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,840
populations and asking if the bacteria

869
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,038
actually benefit from the insects at

870
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,678
all. Are they getting something out of

871
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,200
using insects as a host? Um or is this

872
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,640
actually a dead end for them? Especially

873
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,240
for strains that are highly viralent and

874
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,480
they're killing their host within a few

875
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,960
days. Um is that something that benefits

876
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,440
them at

877
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,720
all? And theoretically it could. Uh we

878
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,798
know that the bacteria grow to really

879
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,558
high numbers inside the insects. Um so

880
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,558
this is data from white flies. So these

881
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:36,240
white flies were infected for 24 hours

882
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:38,639
and then taken off uh the diet and

883
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,519
allowed the bacteria grew inside the the

884
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,640
insects up to fairly high numbers

885
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,079
uh for both strains at a similar

886
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,320
rate. You get similar you actually get

887
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,000
higher numbers in kits a little bigger

888
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:52,480
than white flies I guess. So you get

889
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,880
more growth there. um up to 10^ the 6 to

890
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,360
10^ the 8 cells perphid which is kind of

891
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,880
huge given the size of a um and we know

892
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,519
that those bacteria are going to be

893
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,519
excreted in aphid honeydew. Um honeydew

894
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,240
is kind of a picturesque word of saying

895
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,239
aphid waste. So uh he insects are

896
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,239
feeding on plant sap and they excrete

897
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:14,319
all that extra sugar in this kind of

898
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,918
really sugar rich liquid and infected

899
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,000
aphids can secrete a large number of

900
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,719
bacteria in their honeybee. So,

901
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,280
Stabberes and all found that um infected

902
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:28,799
apids could put up to 10^ the 7 CFU per

903
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,119
square centimeter of bacteria on a leaf.

904
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,560
And he hypothesized that that could be

905
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,320
important for the bacteria in terms of

906
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,719
building up their population sizes but

907
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,240
also dispersing to other hosts. Um, it's

908
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,078
not clear to me if that's necessarily

909
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,519
the case because it might be good

910
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,839
initially to be in honeydew because

911
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,519
you're in this like sugar source, but as

912
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:47,279
that honeydew starts to dry out on the

913
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,039
leaf and the osmalerity changes, you're

914
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,079
then in potentially a really bad

915
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:54,800
environment if you're a bacteria. So to

916
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,639
look at this, we were interested in um

917
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,320
looking at string day persistence in

918
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,760
honeydew. So we took infected aphids, we

919
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,240
collected their honeydew over the course

920
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,920
of 24 hours and at that time we

921
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:08,399
quantified the number of bacteria that

922
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,000
were excreted in the honeydew for some

923
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,440
samples and for the other samples we

924
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,280
took them and we incubated them at

925
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,440
different humidities for an additional

926
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,400
24 hours and then quantify the bacteria

927
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,480
again.

928
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,760
So this is showing the change in

929
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,760
bacterial population and CFU for aphid

930
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,760
um after that incubation compared to

931
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,720
what the initial numbers were in honey

932
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,880
as it was. So it's just persistence in

933
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:36,000
in honeywe without any additional input

934
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,760
from the agents. Um and the full change

935
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,559
is on a log scale because there's a lot

936
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,320
of variation. Um zero would be no

937
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:43,920
change. So the numbers are about the

938
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,359
same as they initially were. population

939
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,000
stay the same and minus one um would be

940
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:54,239
all the bacteria die. So you can see

941
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,920
that at 50 and 75% humidity uh that

942
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:57,598
bacteria don't tend to do very well on

943
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,680
the honeydew actually and it's not until

944
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,800
you get up to 99% humidity that you

945
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:04,879
actually see some

946
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,640
growth. Um so at very high humidities

947
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,640
potentially honeydew might be a

948
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,319
beneficial environment. Um there may

949
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:11,400
also be differences between the strains.

950
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,079
Uh

951
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,960
B728A had like a higher mean than the

952
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:18,400
103,000. Although there's a lot of

953
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,800
overlap here and I don't know if that

954
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,880
would hold up more data for this or

955
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,800
not. Um but again this it's kind of

956
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,400
reinforcing this question of whether um

957
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,720
interacting with insects is actually

958
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,079
beneficial for CIA. Are they going to do

959
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,399
better if there are aphids on a plant

960
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,800
and there's honeydew being laid down um

961
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,639
or is that actually a bad environment?

962
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,880
And to look at this, we set up an

963
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:43,838
experiment where we sprayed epic

964
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,920
populations of B720 a day on plants and

965
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:49,039
then we um introduced aphids onto the

966
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:52,720
plants or or no aphids. Um we let the

967
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:54,639
aphids uh be on the plant um for a week

968
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:58,399
and at the end we sampled epithetic

969
00:36:54,639 --> 00:37:00,799
bacteria on the plants um and quantified

970
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,800
bacterial

971
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,280
populations. So this is just the results

972
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,078
of one experiment, so it's still a bit

973
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,480
preliminary. Um but as you can see the

974
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,519
bacterial numbers were higher at all

975
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,280
humidities when aphas were present. At

976
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,358
the very high humidity it was actually

977
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,760
significantly different and at 50% and

978
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:22,960
75% humidity um there was overlap in the

979
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,119
ranges. There's a fair amount of

980
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,599
variation in the population size from

981
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,440
leaf to leaf and plant to plant. Um but

982
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,960
actually the means are are quite

983
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,079
different. This is a log scale so

984
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,920
there's a high amount of difference

985
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,200
there.

986
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,838
Um, it's not clear to me if this

987
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,679
difference is necessarily because the

988
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,358
bacteria were growing in the apits and

989
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,279
therefore their numbers were increasing

990
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,519
or if maybe they are deriving some

991
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,920
benefit from the honeydew on the leaves.

992
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,838
Um, what I showed you before indicated

993
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,838
that they were only really getting any

994
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,519
benefit at the high humidity. So, I

995
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,358
don't know that that honeydew on the

996
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:59,838
leaves is necessarily helping them that

997
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,679
much at these lower communities. Um, but

998
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,358
that might be uh I'd like to we're going

999
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,919
to be redoing this experiment with more

1000
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,679
samples to see if that holds up or if we

1001
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,440
can get a better sense of how different

1002
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,319
these actually are when they're present

1003
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,320
or not if it's

1004
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,599
present. So to answer that question, do

1005
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,359
uh the bacteria actually benefit from

1006
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,440
having the insects present? Uh the

1007
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,679
answer is sometimes uh depending upon

1008
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,559
the environmental conditions or possibly

1009
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:28,719
on specific strains. And we're going to

1010
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,239
keep working on uh using experiments to

1011
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:32,078
really understand what those conditions

1012
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,399
are, what the environmental abiotic

1013
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:38,000
conditions are or how different strains

1014
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,480
um react to this interaction and how the

1015
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,639
the insects are actually impacting the

1016
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,240
bacteria.

1017
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,000
And altogether kind of looking at both

1018
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,159
sides of this both the insect and the

1019
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,920
bacterial side um we're getting a sense

1020
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,559
that there can be very complex dynamics

1021
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,639
of how serene um interacts not only with

1022
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,239
plants which of course we know but also

1023
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,239
with other members of the ecological

1024
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:01,199
community with other with insects. We

1025
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:03,679
have direct impacts on the survival of

1026
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,399
uh aphids um indirect impacts on the

1027
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:08,799
survival of predators to aphids. Um, we

1028
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,800
know that sur can apparently impact

1029
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,640
aphid feeding and aphid reproduction,

1030
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,960
which of course would have um an

1031
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,799
influence on on plants as it changes the

1032
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,400
aphid

1033
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,240
populations. And then over time, we're

1034
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,160
hoping to get a better sense of how the

1035
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:24,239
aphid also impacts the bacterial

1036
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,920
population um to kind of understand what

1037
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,039
those effects are and when they're when

1038
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,559
they're

1039
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:32,559
meaningful. And then ideally I'd like to

1040
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:34,799
be able to uh connect what we learn

1041
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,559
about these ecological interactions to

1042
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,640
to the underlying genomes. Not just

1043
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,639
looking at insect viralins, but hoping

1044
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,400
to find the genomic basis for other

1045
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:43,838
traits such as aphid avoidance of what

1046
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,760
are the aphids actually picking up on

1047
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,759
and the bacteria that they're avoiding

1048
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,280
if they are avoiding them. Um or what

1049
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,280
bacterial traits are necessary for

1050
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,960
success either in growth inside the

1051
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:58,240
aphid or uh for success on habitats when

1052
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,679
when aphits are present.

1053
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,598
So those are some of the directions that

1054
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:04,159
the lab is going. I just want to um

1055
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,079
briefly thank some people at my previous

1056
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,719
coast labs at University of Arizona and

1057
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,359
Berkeley and then um at the new lab here

1058
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:14,399
Kevin Gler my my lab tech who did uh

1059
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:17,759
some of these experiments our undergrad

1060
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,760
um and funding

1061
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:28,879
from this has been a production of

1062
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,760
Cornell University on the web at

1063
