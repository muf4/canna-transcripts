1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,439
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:12,638
University. Okay. Uh good afternoon

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,120
everybody and uh my name is Mir Sarati

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:18,239
Arat. I'm second year's PhD student in

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,239
Yiani lab and today I'd like to present

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,599
what we have been doing and also

7
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,118
preliminary result on winter oats and P

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,400
intercropping.

9
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:31,678
And firstly I'd like to define what

10
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:34,799
intercropping system is. Uh and so

11
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,320
intercropping or mixed cropping is

12
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,599
simultaneous

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:45,480
uh cultivation of two or more crops in

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:48,640
the same field and it it and it's and uh

15
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,959
ancient uh ag uh agricultural

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,759
agricultural practice that has been

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,480
implemented in uh for years in

18
00:00:54,759 --> 00:01:04,239
particularly Africa and also Asia and

19
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:06,759
but recently It's just uh been gaining

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:12,560
uh renewed uh

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:16,560
interested that's um uh that's uh uh

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:20,079
provides more uh efficiency and also

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,478
sustainability in agriculture. But other

24
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,798
than that there's also a couple benefits

25
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,280
for uh in

26
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:33,200
intercropping which are uh increase

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:37,439
total yield and uh yield stability,

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,159
improve uh soil health, reduce inputs

29
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:44,239
and also increase resilience of the

30
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:47,520
crops against pace and disease. And

31
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:51,118
there's one combination that have been

32
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:54,879
planted in this system which which is

33
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:59,519
combination uh winter oats and also peas

34
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:03,319
that's believed to provide a synergic uh

35
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:07,759
implement uh synergic uh

36
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:12,079
complimentary that's where oats provides

37
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:16,479
uh structural support to the piece and P

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,840
help Oats to nitrogen fixing

39
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:23,598
uh that support the growth of the oats.

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,680
And with these backgrounds we came out

41
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:30,519
came up with one research question which

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:34,640
is how do we select the best winter oats

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,360
action for uh winter oats and P

44
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:41,679
intercropping system and for answering

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:45,440
this question we have been doing

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,560
uh a trials that's the which is a winter

47
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:54,598
oats and peace trial and in our first

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:58,959
year's trial In 2023 to to 2024, we

49
00:02:54,598 --> 00:03:02,079
planted 94 winter oats actation from

50
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:06,080
three different uh sources in

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:10,159
combination with one winterpiece variety

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,480
which was uh blaze. And we planted these

53
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:16,318
crops in incomplete block

54
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:20,158
designs where monocrop and also

55
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:24,439
intercrops uh plots uh planted side by

56
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,959
sides. And the total uh plots was

57
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:29,759
378

58
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,959
plots. And for our uh for preliminary

59
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:36,239
result of this

60
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:40,080
trial, we use a mix model to calculate

61
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,719
this heritability of five traits. And

62
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,719
here you can see that there's uh

63
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:50,840
variation or there's uh uh yeah there's

64
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:53,680
uh there were v uh variation in

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,920
heritability from low to high and

66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,680
especially here we can see that uh high

67
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:02,518
heritability on uh oats freeze

68
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:08,959
damage and

69
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:11,519
then we make uh box plots for oats and p

70
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,438
grand yield and you can see here there's

71
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,319
no much difference on oats grand yield

72
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:22,319
if we want to compare between intercrop

73
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:26,959
and also monocrop in contrast to oats

74
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:30,240
for p grand shield there's there's uh

75
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:34,319
significant not significant but there's

76
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,960
uh lower grand yield in intercrop

77
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:40,159
compared to monocrop and we try to

78
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,638
confirm this research results by

79
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,880
calculate the correlation between the

80
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,840
traits and it shows here that there's uh

81
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:56,120
negative moderates correlation between

82
00:04:49,839 --> 00:05:00,478
gr uh odds grand yield of versus p grand

83
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:04,959
yield and next analysis what we have uh

84
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:07,758
we did that we tried to figure out

85
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:12,159
what's how the general mixing ability

86
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,160
with this uh osation and let me briefly

87
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,919
explain about general mixing ability

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:23,439
here. So uh here general mixing ability

89
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:27,478
shows that uh how the odds act

90
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:31,120
uh performs in the uh in the

91
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:34,399
intercropping with P and for this

92
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,600
general mixing ability the it's divided

93
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:40,638
into two which are uh producer effect

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,879
and also associate effect for associate

95
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:49,680
effect means that how this uh Winter

96
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:52,639
oats accations uh influence the oats

97
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:57,600
grain yield and for associate effect

98
00:05:52,639 --> 00:06:01,199
here that uh uh represents how the oats

99
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,840
uh accession here affect the grand yield

100
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:09,120
of the bee and you uh for and in this

101
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:12,079
graph you can see there's a couple uh

102
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,959
green points here that represents or

103
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:18,959
shows the uh accession with positive uh

104
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,079
producer effect and also positive

105
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:25,198
associate effect. And if you uh if you

106
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:28,399
want uh and in detailed you can see all

107
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:32,560
these accession on the table at the

108
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:35,599
right sides. There are 18 that have

109
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,800
positive in both effects. However,

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,759
there's also positive uh uh general

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:47,360
mixing ability on the red points here.

112
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:52,800
uh that's located uh above this di

113
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,680
diagonal uh uh lines or identity lines.

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,720
And then

115
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:02,400
finally after uh using uh index

116
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,680
selection we were able to select 72

117
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:09,839
winter oats actation for from our first

118
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:14,879
year trial and eight added more 16

119
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:19,439
aation from green uh which are uh

120
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:23,000
assumed to be pure winter oats uh winter

121
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:26,079
oats actation and we combine all these

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,560
actation and we plant it in our second

123
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,560
year's

124
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:38,720
trial. And what's comes next uh is we

125
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,160
are expecting to collect more data in

126
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,199
this spring and also uh harpers the

127
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
trial in

128
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:54,319
summer and I'd like to thanks for my P

129
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:57,519
to my P uh Jan Luke Yanik for giving me

130
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,960
this opportunity to join this uh project

131
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:04,240
and to Peter Leah and also Tespa for

132
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:07,598
helping me throughout this project. To

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:12,400
Mark Sorel and also David for providing

134
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:15,519
us with some uh resources and to all JS

135

group members for constructive uh

136
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:21,279
feedback and also great help in the

137
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:25,960
field last summer. to Adrian undergrads

138
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:30,159
who helps us uh during summer and to

139
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:33,838
Lauren who provided us with uh plant

140
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,360
materials and also some genotype data

141
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:43,120
and uh uh I'd also want to thank

142
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,120
fullbrite for funding my uh doctoral

143
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:50,319
program and uh thank you and happy to

144
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,319
take any

145
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,639
you expected that uh the the winter pee

146
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,559
would be more sensitive to the

147
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:01,759
intercropping and and what might be

148
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:06,278
driving that? So we are uh uh so we are

149
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:12,278
expecting that to find

150
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:15,200
uh to find uh accession that not too

151
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:18,320
sensitive to intercropping. It means

152
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,080
that without uh it means that there's no

153
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,160
much different between monocrop and

154
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:27,879
intercrop and to uh so we don't need to

155
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:31,679
to like establish new uh breeding

156
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:38,439
program because we can use monocrop uh

157
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:38,439
scheme to uh for for intercropping.

158
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,639
So I was wondering you had the pictures

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,240
of like the peas basically growing on

160
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:48,480
the oat stocks. Yes. I was wondering for

161
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,039
that is there any kind of difficulty

162
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,920
that would be come across whenever you

163
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,919
go to harvest that material?

164
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:05,919
Uh yes. So here yes actually there's um

165
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,919
some challenging challenges in

166
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:14,559
harvesting this because

167
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:17,519
um the the pee tend to load. So we have

168
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:20,958
to make sure that it's like straight up

169
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,399
before harvesting. So it's like yeah

170
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:27,399
there's couple uh strategy before

171
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,399
harvesting.

172
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:35,120
Okay. Um so today I'll be talking about

173
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:38,319
um uh doing QTL discovery in OP

174
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,440
pollinated populations of apples. Um and

175
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:46,560
like uh Charlie said I'm in the labs of

176
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,560
Dr. Waist Con and Kelly Robbins. Um

177
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:53,838
so oh boy. Okay. So a little bit of an

178
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,679
overview of this presentation. Um I'm

179
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,800
going to talk about the motivation. why

180
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,120
do this in OP

181
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:05,359
um population and not just traditional

182
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,959
by parental populations. Um I'll also go

183
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,879
over um a framework I'm using for

184
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:13,599
simulations um to look at the efficacy

185
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:17,278
of QTL mapping in OP populations of

186
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,920
Apple. Um I also do need to mention the

187
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:23,838
role of imputation and quality control

188
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:26,399
um as that is starting to be uh is is

189
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,200
apparent as being very important in um

190
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,360
getting accurate QTL results um in our

191
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,560
market trade

192
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,440
associations. Um I'll go over the

193
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:38,278
results of our mapping power, our false

194
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,640
discovery rate, and our fine mapping

195
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:43,639
resolution. And then I'll end with some

196
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,639
takeaways.

197
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,480
So first why open pollinated mapping in

198
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:52,639
apples? So logistically

199
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,079
um it is difficult to make bipontal

200
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:59,720
populations. It requires um obviously

201
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:03,838
crossing in the field. And with apples

202
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:06,240
um there's quite a bit of extra kind of

203
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,519
logistical um things to keep in mind

204
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,959
like uh flowering time, number of

205
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,039
flowers on the plant, the amount of

206
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:18,159
pollen that you can get. Um, so it's not

207
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,919
uncommon to have to cross with multiple

208
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,838
different trees and potentially even

209
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,319
multiple different genotypes to get the

210
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,079
amount of um, seed required to produce

211
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,040
an F1 population. Um, so with OP uh,

212
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,359
with an OP with an OP population, you

213
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,919
would just need to select a maternal

214
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,039
plant, gather seed from that plant, and

215
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,639
then plant out your F1 population. Um,

216
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,639
additionally, uh, there's long

217
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,200
generation times that limit limit

218
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,440
mapping population turnover. So, this

219
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,440
would go in tandem with an OP mapping

220
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,920
scheme where you could screen for a

221
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,720
trait early on and not have to grow it

222
00:12:51,919 --> 00:13:00,479
out to a full um, apple tree. So traits

223
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,079
maybe like fruit quality um wouldn't be

224
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,519
the best for this scheme because you

225
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:10,078
would need to spend the five five or six

226
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,399
years uh uh cultivating the the um the

227
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,239
population to to screen for those

228
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,720
traits. But something like disease

229
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,919
resistance or anthocyanin content or um

230
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,639
something like that would be would be uh

231
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:27,599
would be ideal. Um, additionally,

232
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,000
research orchards provide um a diverse

233
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,399
and already established um source of

234
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,440
germ plasm. So, apples are highly

235
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,399
hetererozygous and don't grow true to

236
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,120
like true to type from their seed. Um,

237
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,720
so they must be maintained in an orchard

238
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,759
um as that specific genotype. So at

239
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,600
Cornell Agretch um most of the research

240
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:54,159
orchards have a couple hundred um up to

241
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,800
a hundred um individual genotypes

242
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,319
growing actively growing in the orchard.

243
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,439
And then there's also the germ plasm

244
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,680
repository which has um 5,000 plus

245
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,959
apples growing apple trees that are

246
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,879
already established. So, um being able

247
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:14,479
to utilize all of this diversity all at

248
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:17,120
once um would would give you um

249
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,159
um a lot broader range of of genetics to

250
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,278
pull from. And then OP populations

251
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:27,439
capture natural re combination um that

252
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:31,519
utilize this diversity. And if you do um

253
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,079
detect a QTL um you can be more sure

254
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,759
that it's going to be stable across a

255
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,198
broader range of genetic backgrounds.

256
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,198
You're not just using a biparental

257
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,198
population.

258
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,799
So for my research I'm using a

259
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:53,278
population that was developed at the um

260
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:56,319
germ plasm repository which is um seven

261
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,320
bulid populations but the one thing that

262
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,278
these these populations have in common

263
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,320
is the maternal parent which is what is

264
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,838
crucial for this OP mapping scheme. So

265
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,240
we have seven

266
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:13,839
malisersi pollen parents, pollen donors

267
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:17,560
and one common seed parent of royal gala

268
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:21,600
which make seven um distinct full sip

269
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:24,679
populations but in aggregate is a half

270
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,240
sib population.

271
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:30,799
And with OP mapping the if you do

272
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,198
collect from one tree it is in an

273
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,278
essence just

274
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:40,000
one half SIB population. So this is a

275
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:43,639
good proxy um for studying uh how to how

276
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,159
to do um uh QTL mapping in an OP

277
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:50,000
population. Um additionally um because

278
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,399
we know the pollen parents it allows us

279
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,958
to verify our results.

280
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,480
um

281
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,758
and

282
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,399
uh kind of go further into the analysis

283
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:06,720
in how much does knowing the pollen

284
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,720
parent affect our ability to

285
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,839
map. So I am using simulations to get

286
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:16,719
these results and to do that what I'm

287
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,759
using is that same biparental data set

288
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,440
of the seven full SI populations.

289
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,680
um I calculate a genomic relationship

290
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,199
matrix and set a QTL at a snip that's

291
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,319
segregating

292
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,078
um solely from the maternal parent. Um

293
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,639
so that know that it's segregating

294
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:38,958
within the F1 population. I then

295
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,959
simulate the phenotypes in that F1

296
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,440
population and then I mask the snip by

297
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,959
removing it from the data set. I then

298
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,480
use my model um and reduce the

299
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:55,518
population size 15 times to look at how

300
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,159
um effective this OP mapping scheme

301
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,919
would be across population sizes. So I

302
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:03,198
do that 15

303
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:05,119
times. I then get marker trade

304
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,759
associations for these 15 different

305
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:12,438
population sizes and then repeat this

306
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:15,240
process 40 times by reamp reimulating um

307
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:18,240
phenotypes all with all all on the same

308
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,240
locus.

309
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:22,879
Um additionally there are different

310
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,359
simulation parameters that I'm looking

311
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:31,520
at. So um there's two different genetic

312
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:34,240
variances um of 0.8 8 and 0.5 with the

313
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,960
background variance being also 0.2 and

314
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,558
0.5 respectively. Um I'm looking at the

315
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,640
same heritability for each scenario

316
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,839
which is

317
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,600
0.5. But I'm looking on two different

318
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,759
linkage groups with two different LD

319
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,759
levels. So kind of separate

320
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,038
recombination rates. So one with a

321
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,119
higher and one with a lower

322
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:54,160
recombination rate to see how that

323
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:58,359
affects um the efficacy of the mapping

324
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,360
in this F1 population.

325
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,038
Um, and then the important detail about

326
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,279
knowing the parents is that I can then

327
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:11,798
go back and compare the market rate

328
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,678
associations to the no known QTL

329
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:18,639
position and calculate power um, fine

330
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,038
mapping resolution and false discovery

331
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,038
rate across these different population

332
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,038
sizes.

333
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:30,400
Um, another thing we're finding out is

334
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,520
that imputation is very important in OP

335
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,600
mapping, especially in Apple. So, GBS

336
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:39,839
data can contain a high level of

337
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,480
missingness. Um, amputation errors can

338
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,480
lead to erroneous

339
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,400
associations.

340
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,880
Um, high quality amputation improves

341
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,000
detection of QTL. Um, I think especially

342
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,679
both in apples and this OP data set. And

343
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,919
it's important for highly hetererozygous

344
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,320
individuals. You don't want to be having

345
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:05,200
a bunch of um erroneous homozygous calls

346
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:05,200
when say your QTL is on a hetererozygous

347
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,960
site. So what I've done is I've detected

348
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:16,240
and filtered impossible genotypes that

349
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:21,679
are found in this um by parental data

350
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:24,400
set. So as you can see here um there are

351
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,400
the eight parental genotypes, the seven

352
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,880
subversi and then at the bottom is the

353
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,559
royal gala. The royal gala is

354
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,080
hetererozygous at this at this

355
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:36,359
particular locus. Um but all of the um

356
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,199
subversi pollen donors

357
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:43,000
are are

358
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:47,440
homozygous and so that would guarantee

359
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,119
that the QTL is segregating from the

360
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:57,440
royal gala um seed parent. Um however in

361
00:19:51,119 --> 00:20:00,959
the F1s you see um some homozygous uh

362
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:05,519
homozygous sites that have the alil that

363
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:10,079
is only present in the hetererozygous um

364
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:13,119
pollen donor. Um so that's likely due to

365
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:16,879
genotyping errors. So I must remove

366
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:18,558
those sites and then imputee those and

367
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,799
keep checking back to see if it's

368
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:25,599
imputing them as being a site that's

369
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:27,519
possible um in this scheme. Um so I set

370
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,839
those sites to missing impute using

371
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,079
Beagle. Um I'm using Beagle to be

372
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:35,119
agnostic to

373
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:37,439
parentage. Um and then uh this is also

374
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,279
critical for ensuring the reliability of

375
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,279
my mapping results because if you do

376
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:45,359
have um if site segregating from this

377
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:48,158
particular alil and it's over

378
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,759
represented in the population your um

379
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,559
QTL mapping is not going to be as

380
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:56,279
accurate as it could

381
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:59,200
be. So the results I'm getting

382
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:03,359
um show that power improves with QTL

383
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:07,360
strength and population size. Um here

384
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:10,399
there are blue and red lines indicating

385
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:12,319
the re combination rate. So rather

386
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,640
depending on which linkage group it is

387
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:18,879
what what the LD LD level is. So a

388
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,400
higher recombination rate is in red a

389
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:26,240
lower is in blue. And then the effect

390
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,400
size of the QTL is indicated by either a

391
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,880
um solid or dashed line. So the solid

392
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,840
line would be a major trait with a

393
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,200
genetic vari genetic variation explained

394
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:42,959
of 0.8 and with dash it's the genetic

395
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,038
variation explained of 0.5. And what we

396
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,480
can see here is that higher genetic

397
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:51,038
variance means that you need a lower

398
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,319
population size to get a higher power.

399
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,759
And the threshold I'm setting is

400
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:59,918
0.8. Um and it seems to kind of be the

401
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:02,558
case for both high and lower combination

402
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:06,320
rates that you do get a higher power um

403
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,319
with a higher genetic variance

404
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,319
explained. Um and again larger

405
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:19,120
population sizes and stronger QTL reduce

406
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:21,439
false positives. So in this case um the

407
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:24,079
lower combination rate reduces the false

408
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,960
positive rate um with increasing

409
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:30,240
population size um and everything does

410
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,360
seem to kind of converge around between

411
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,440
around 500 uh

412
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:37,279
individuals. So um for this and the last

413
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,679
one I used a two megabase pair window

414
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:42,519
around the positive snip to define what

415
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:46,000
a true positive would be.

416
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:49,359
Um and uh the OP mapping maintains

417
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,759
acceptable FDR with um the proper uh

418
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:55,759
design and proper population

419
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:55,759
size.

420
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:02,080
Um and then also resolution to the QTL

421
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,798
improves the genetic variance and

422
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,639
population size. So I measured the

423
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,038
distance to the furthest significant

424
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,640
snip from the causal QTL across all the

425
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,879
simulations.

426
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,960
So each of these data point rep data

427
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,760
points represents the average of all of

428
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,319
those 40 repetitions that I did and

429
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,440
there's 15 data points per scenario for

430
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:26,639
the 15 different population

431
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:31,519
sizes. Um and with this it all converges

432
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,520
around uh I'd say 5 to 600 individuals

433
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,918
with a resolution

434
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:40,639
um between one and two megabase pairs.

435
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:43,200
Um so again a higher genetic variance

436
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,759
and larger populations equals a tighter

437
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,759
QTL

438
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:53,439
region. So some of the takeaways from

439
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:55,599
this analysis is that um OP mapping is

440
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,240
effective with sufficient sample size

441
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,639
and marker density. Um power and

442
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,240
resolution increase with UTL effect and

443
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,480
population size and imputation and

444
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,200
genotype quality control are essential.

445
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,919
However, there are some caveats to this.

446
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,558
Um, because I knew the parents, I was

447
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,799
able to see in the F1 population that

448
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,720
there were impossible genotypes. If I

449
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:22,720
didn't know the parents, I wouldn't be

450
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,558
able to do that. Um, so we're looking at

451
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,400
new methods um to do this kind of

452
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:31,519
imputation um without knowing the

453
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,159
parents um which could include like HLO

454
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,759
type tracking or something like that.

455
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,440
And this has the potential for a

456
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,400
scalable framework for perennial crop

457
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:44,159
genetics. So you'd be able to collect a

458
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,120
massive amounts of seed um and produce a

459
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:50,799
large F1 population without having to do

460
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:53,278
any crosses or go out in the field and

461
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:55,119
you know track a flowering rate or

462
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,679
flowering time. Look at how many flowers

463
00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:00,639
there are per tree. Um collect and store

464
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,720
pollen. um make sure that there's

465
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,919
overlap between when you collect the

466
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,919
pollen when you can

467
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:11,079
pollinate. Um I'd like to acknowledge um

468
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,159
my

469
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:18,158
committee um both of my labs, the Khan

470
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:21,679
and Robbins lab um Cornell Agretch, the

471
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:24,520
USDA germplasm repository and also the

472
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,798
NSF NRT

473
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:29,440
fellowship and I will open up for

474
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:33,038
questions.

475
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,640
Yes, Sarah. Um, to what extent does

476
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,879
flowering time like differences in

477
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,840
flowering time limit the diversity of

478
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,559
pollen parents that end up getting um

479
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,278
pollinating in your um diverse

480
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,639
population? So, I'm not entirely sure in

481
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,798
total, right, because we're dealing with

482
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,919
so many genotypes. But what it does mean

483
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:54,639
is that we have to go out every year and

484
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,200
actually track when the flowers are

485
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,440
coming in because it's not on the same

486
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,360
day every year. There's also a lot of

487
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,120
environmental variation that can go into

488
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:08,079
when um a plant might or when a tree

489
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:12,359
might flower. Um so it completely

490
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,359
eliminate the need for doing that.

491
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,640
Oh. Um.

492
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,759
Oh, I could read. Yeah. From Jackson.

493
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,080
Have you ever dealt with an impossible

494
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,759
genotype in your F1 population that was

495
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,829
caused by your parental genotype

496
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,970
reference being incorrect?

00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:37,759
Um, can you repeat that question?

499
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
you ever dealt with an impossible

500
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,000
genotype in your F1 population that was

501
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,080
caused by your parental genotype

502
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,599
reference being Oh, I I don't know. Um,

503
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,439
yeah, I'm I'm not sure. That is

504
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,038
something I should look into because

505
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,159
right, if the maternal

506
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:56,720
hetererozygous genotype is called

507
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,320
incorrectly, then at least with this

508
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,159
simulation, that throws everything off.

509
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:03,839
Yeah. John, so just make sure you you

510
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,880
thanks for the presentation by the way.

511
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,759
Uh you describe the considerable

512
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,400
benefits of of OP as opposed to making

513
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,079
full sibs, right? Because making full

514
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,559
sib is just a lot of work sounds like.

515
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:19,278
Yeah. But the actual data set that you

516
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,200
have, somebody did that work seven

517
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,599
times, right? Yes. So this is a lot of

518
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,120
work went into this data set. Yeah. Just

519
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,798
wanted to make sure. Yeah.

520
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,439
Not sure if you know the answer to this.

521
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,278
I don't even know. Um, but for your germ

522
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,159
plasm, I'm assuming they're very

523
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:39,038
diverged like lineage wise. So, do you

524
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,559
think there are any weird GBS calls due

525
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:45,038
to perhaps chromosomeal

526
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:46,879
differences? I don't know how um, you

527
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:50,720
want to talk I'm trying to say I guess

528
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,360
kind of I I I mean, so the the the GBS

529
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,159
was done at around I think between four

530
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,319
and 6x depth for each of the each of the

531
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,200
subversi populations. the parents were

532
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,278
done at a higher depth. Um I don't think

533
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,200
that would be that much of an issue in

534
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,759
this

535
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,000
particular case because it is coming

536
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,558
from seven

537
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,720
subversi which are more closely related

538
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:19,359
than say looking at a orientalis and a

539
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,399
hybrid and a domestica. So I don't think

540
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,719
that would have caused any any of these

541
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:29,359
problems. I think it's likely due to the

542
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:32,759
the depth or coverage of the GBF data.

543
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:32,759
