2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

joyful journey to go through so please

11
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,140
we find it and we find it it's all

12
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:32,969
worthwhile and there's being very

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:39,450
interesting and intriguing to work with

14
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:41,909
peanuts we starting working with Peter I

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,070
working in Bravo which is the Brazilian

16
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:48,209
cooperation that was for agriculture

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,210
development and working with peanuts

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,759
when we started 15 years ago there was

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,200
very little known about peanuts wilds

20
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,289
very little there's a lot of connections

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,560
but not much known about it there was

22
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:08,819
sick a grand total of six microsatellite

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:11,990
markers for peanuts and the mere act of

24
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:14,549
extracting DNA was a stumbling block and

25
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:18,810
until we found a very nice protocol

26
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:21,450
which is Doyle and oil so in a way new

27
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,969
Jekyll before we knew him personally so

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,270
being here giving a same they're invited

29
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:29,548
by him by V Doyle and now it's is a

30
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:34,349
great great pleasure and honor so thank

31
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:37,170
you very much Jeff so what I wanted to

32
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:38,759
do was in a while I think peanut is not

33
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,618
very well known in a number of places

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,590
although we us is very important the

35
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:45,450
u.s. so I really wanted to give a sort

36
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,310
of good background on what peanuts is

37
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,040
like what the wild species are like a

38
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:55,228
wild work with wild species and some of

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,479
the interesting fine as we've had in the

40
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,700
last couple of years right at the end so

41
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,129
starting with peanut I think most of you

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,359
I think the good international community

43
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:08,429
here but for the American ones you know

44
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:11,878
United States is a very big producer of

45
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:14,609
peanut and also very big a user you know

46
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,798
a lot of you have had these in your

47
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:17,850
school years peanut butter jelly

48
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:20,040
sandwich

49
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:21,930
if you're more from the South you may be

50
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,259
familiar with it which is great wall

51
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:29,460
peanuts love them so it's a very

52
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:32,789
important crop in the US although us

53
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:36,870
only produces 6% a lot of the production

54
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:38,699
is here in China in India most of it

55
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:46,740
stays there a lot of it is used for oil

56
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:49,739
or just eaten or for crop for cattle but

57
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,379
Africa is one of our passions is is a

58
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,620
place where it is really port in terms

59
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:57,810
of staple food is where Anna women are

60
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,259
more involved in the production they

61
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,879
actually the women and the children plan

62
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:05,459
the peanut a lot of the time they

63
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,000
harvest it and is a source of income for

64
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:12,060
the families where a society's more or

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,909
less male-dominated either sort of a

66
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:19,530
little bit of freedom and that the women

67
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:22,109
have and they I'd like to show these

68
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,840
plumpy nut to sometimes use it was

69
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,820
created originally by a French

70
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:31,590
pediatrician and I love that because

71
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:34,079
that's our like in a packet food that is

72
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,360
used for combating mal nourishment for

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,210
children so there has been some

74
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,230
campaigns and you know have children

75
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:46,140
would be on hope and they they get a lot

76
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:48,119
of working up using plumpy nut or

77
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,819
related products so it's something is

78
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,969
really important in Africa and brings

79
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:57,930
your security in Kenya in a small

80
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:59,129
supermarket get more peanut products and

81
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,510
I've ever seen anywhere else in the

82
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:04,049
world I think is just amazing the way

83
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:08,879
they use it and it so important in

84
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:11,610
Africa and I think the first written

85
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,930
record that that I've seen there no we

86
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:20,069
looked at was by gonzalo Nanda severe de

87
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:22,319
valdes his he was a spanish writer he

88
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:27,389
wrote chronicles in the times of the

89
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:29,469
great navigations and then these was

90
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:32,050
found in de espanol as they

91
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,860
in caribbean's so you know think about

92
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,780
the context of the time the 1500s so

93
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,050
money which is spinach is very common

94
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:42,189
with the Indians with the native Indians

95
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,040
Christians they can live a comfort in

96
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:47,170
them and people they eaten most of my

97
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,850
lowly men and boys slaves and by people

98
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,240
who do not pardon the taste for anything

99
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,340
so it really wasn't very appreciated

100
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,980
like it is nowadays but it's interesting

101
00:04:54,339 --> 00:05:01,060
the way he saves the weights eaten by

102
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:03,939
the native people what 200 years late it

103
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,790
was and it was called iraqis hypogaea

104
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:10,689
because of the way the fruit bear is in

105
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:13,960
the end of soil by Linnaeus and it

106
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:17,199
became very popular in the US by George

107
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:22,060
Washington Carver he was a scientist

108
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:24,069
inventor and he thought out 300 years of

109
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,759
peanut and is actually quite famous and

110
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:29,469
what his work a lot of what we have

111
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,939
nowadays and peanuts in the u.s. is

112
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:36,990
derived from from his work election if

113
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:42,399
you can hear me at the back can you hear

114
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:45,180
that louder thank you thank you just say

115
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,179
if you can't hear

116
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,430
so a rocket hypogaea it's um it belongs

117
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,290
to the family of the papilla need a

118
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:59,910
subfamily popular needy and it's quite

119
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,439
basil it's here with the stellas aunties

120
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:06,130
the things the genus that is more

121
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:10,180
closely related to Arrakis and is the

122
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:14,139
important feature of iraqis is the

123
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:19,990
subterranean fruit so the flower the

124
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:24,099
ovary the peg of the flower is Paula

125
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:26,350
nized the the peg grows into the soil

126
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:31,990
and at the end of the peg the fruit is

127
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:35,580
develops so this because it's a self

128
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:39,550
pollinating the fruit is under the soil

129
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:43,329
the dispersion is very poor so you have

130
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:46,629
in areas you have populations that stay

131
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:49,800
there for hundreds of years so per year

132
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:53,949
you have this person of about one meter

133
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,780
so imagined to go one killing me to take

134
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:58,509
a thousand years so the dispersion is

135
00:06:55,779 --> 00:07:03,000
very poor and a lot of the dispersion of

136
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:06,670
Iraqis has been done by by native people

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,370
so the center of diversity unlike a lot

138
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:12,250
of people think so you think a pinner to

139
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,379
think Africa because a lot of it made

140
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,350
all its way to Africa in pre-columbian

141
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:20,230
times but the primer Center zactly in

142
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,870
South America these region the north of

143
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:27,100
Argentina's south of Bolivia and then

144
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:29,740
these lines are migration lines you can

145
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,480
see anthropology's is the field work for

146
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:36,610
apologies because these are migration

147
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:40,000
lines of the native amer Indians the

148
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,100
first archaeological remains of

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,819
something looking like a peanut were

150
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,820
found in Peru about 8,000 years ago and

151
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,889
these are very interesting civilization

152
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,800
the mochi again in Peru they are very

153
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:58,589
interesting pottery they they were very

154
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,780
well developed

155
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:04,810
civilization and they if you google

156
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:08,739
mochi pottery it's very very interesting

157
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,449
so it's worthwhile and among the lots of

158
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,110
interesting pottery some of them look

159
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:16,300
like peanuts and showing importance of

160
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,370
peanut in their society but more than

161
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,360
that I think it's really nice recently

162
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:24,639
they found remains of the Lord of Sipan

163
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,350
they were very rich they traded in gold

164
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:33,539
they had very sophisticated clothes

165
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:33,540
ornaments and they had very interesting

166
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,159
well probably religious traditions so

167
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:42,159
Lord of Sipan was one of the most

168
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:46,629
important persons and look at his

169
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,850
necklace all made of gold and so thus i

170
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:51,970
once I was gold the other was silver

171
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:54,129
that shows the Sun and the moon so all

172
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,620
into the peanut so it's it's been very

173
00:08:54,129 --> 00:09:00,789
important in South America for hundreds

174
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:03,929
maybe thousands of years and if you

175
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:07,299
being used by native Brazilian India's

176
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:11,919
visas Kaiba Indians and the reservation

177
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:15,609
of shingle and they grow simply looking

178
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:19,089
like a land race and these peanuts here

179
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,680
they do not fit into any of the six

180
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:24,040
botanical varieties are completely

181
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:28,569
different so you know is being fought

182
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:29,980
now that is area is one of the new when

183
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,230
they won all of the new centers of

184
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,710
diversity so that's being established

185
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,710
now

186
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:43,189
so the origin is here the north of

187
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:47,748
argentina and south of Bolivia right at

188
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:50,538
the verge over the Andes and one thing

189
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:53,749
that is remarkable about about it is

190
00:09:50,538 --> 00:09:55,399
that and for many years researchers

191
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:58,129
looked what were the progenitors of

192
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,438
peanut and you well established now that

193
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:03,589
Iraq is appliances and Iraq is door

194
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:07,328
announces are the two most likely

195
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:10,639
projectors and Iraqis are announced is

196
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:13,488
there are several accessions in this

197
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,408
area this is the air of occurrence but

198
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:18,979
Iraqis appliances has only been found

199
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:20,928
once and after going back there they

200
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:23,809
never population anymore so it's

201
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:25,338
probably extinct in the wild so in fact

202
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:27,889
we were very lucky to be able to have it

203
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:29,569
and this is one of the joys of working

204
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:33,408
with peanuts we know what the

205
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:35,778
progenitors are and the closest related

206
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:40,009
species to Iraqis appliance which is

207
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:44,568
Arrakis magna it's found here about 500

208
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:49,009
kilometers away lower down so it is very

209
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:51,469
clear that there was the work of man in

210
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:54,318
the creation well in the origin of

211
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:58,269
peanut because they were probably this

212
00:10:54,318 --> 00:11:00,769
week will probably grow in these these

213
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:04,328
accessions these plants in small gardens

214
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:06,139
and there was some colonization and

215
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:11,678
anyway i'm going to show this in a

216
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:13,849
minute so peanut is an olive tetraploid

217
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:16,249
so when i started thinking about

218
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:18,528
genetics you know that's that's what it

219
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:20,470
is and we have we had some stumbling

220
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:24,198
blocks along the way because of that but

221
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:26,269
anyway the most likely progenitor is

222
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:30,348
iraqis door lenses which is a deployed

223
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:32,749
is called a genome because you know they

224
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:35,359
have there is a small chromosome which

225
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:40,359
is called a chromosome in this central

226
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:44,299
medic bands and the Iraqis appliances at

227
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:48,410
some point they crossed there was his

228
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:51,338
diploid hybrid which was

229
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:53,389
info tile through spontaneous

230
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:56,990
replication there was a tetraploid

231
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:58,789
ization and created something arose that

232
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,009
it's similar to what we know peanut

233
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:03,439
nowadays but obviously through

234
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:07,629
domestication and we're very interested

235
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,189
in what made the people at the time

236
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:12,379
realize that this plant was tetraploid

237
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:15,588
and was more interesting and it could

238
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:20,389
actually give rise to something which is

239
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:22,939
so different from the wild deployed so

240
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:25,188
as you can imagine since peanut is a

241
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:28,179
tetraploid and the wild species are

242
00:12:25,188 --> 00:12:31,519
deployed that created a tremendous

243
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:33,528
bottleneck so we cannot find you cannot

244
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,828
cross them when you cross them you get

245
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:40,879
some info tile triploids which are

246
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:43,938
useless so in nature you have these

247
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:47,449
deployed species which are already quite

248
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:49,099
separate and then you have the peanut

249
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:51,469
which is tetraploid so it's completely

250
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:55,850
isolated from its wild relative so gene

251
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:58,579
flow is irrelevant is very limited this

252
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:02,180
very old slide very very old slides re

253
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:05,508
from maybe 10 years ago showing

254
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:07,969
microsatellite markers in different one

255
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:10,699
market in different accessions and

256
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,189
different extra batanga varieties and we

257
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:15,258
found very very little polymorphism

258
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:18,919
that's always been a problem for peanut

259
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:22,129
very little polymorphism and accessions

260
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:27,068
of the same species in wild we find all

261
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:30,350
sorts of polymorphisms so we one of our

262
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:33,948
missions and our roles in what we do is

263
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:37,790
to bring wild alleles to bring new

264
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:40,539
traits to general Chu help of genetics

265
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:44,480
and peanuts and to increase resistances

266
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:47,419
this was a in an old photo again ten

267
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,058
years ago of the first synthetic a

268
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:53,179
little ploy to produce via group so you

269
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:55,338
have the synthetic here and this was a

270
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:57,979
spontaneous and of fungus the fungus

271
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:00,589
sometimes the green house you have virus

272
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,200
and fungal have all sorts so peanut got

273
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,700
completely fried

274
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,210
completely devastated with the fungus

275
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:10,330
and the synthetic was still happy alive

276
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:12,550
so that was because we knew about

277
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,230
resistances but this is sore subject

278
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:20,949
came in spontaneously in the greenhouse

279
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:24,009
and we kept this for posterity so this

280
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:29,470
is where the wild species are

281
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:32,620
distributed in South America so we can

282
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:35,259
see a lot of river flow through river

283
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,570
areas here and we see also when it

284
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:39,759
looked more closely a lot of migration

285
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:45,160
groups now I'd like to point out these

286
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:47,379
one here these is a as an isolated patch

287
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:50,469
of Arrakis tell experiment which is one

288
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:54,700
of the most resistant plants species of

289
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:58,360
peanut and we don't see you can see that

290
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,700
is clearly taken by Indians and we find

291
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,590
this isolated population here and we

292
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,710
find all the populations around other

293
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:09,820
parts of Brazil so in there are many

294
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:12,400
evidences of people carrying peanut

295
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:17,170
seeds or Arrakis seeds in south america

296
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:19,629
in the racket is found in all sorts of

297
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:22,860
environments so involved with all in all

298
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:25,899
sorts of conditions and there has been

299
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:29,830
having a lot of effort for collection

300
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:35,139
for understanding what the plants are

301
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:37,360
like or and identification and these are

302
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:39,159
the three people who are alive I mean a

303
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,289
lot of them I disease now but these are

304
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:43,329
the three most important people who work

305
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:45,669
with peanuts who understand about wild

306
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,710
species daughter child seems some from

307
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:50,259
Texas A&amp;M Hill Emma Seydoux from

308
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:54,879
Argentina angels Devils who I'm a

309
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:58,990
colleague with in rapper Brazil there

310
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,340
are several banks germplasm banks all

311
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:04,090
over the place but these are the most

312
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:07,629
important ones and I would like to point

313
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:11,019
out that Tim until the convention of

314
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:14,320
biodiversity exchange on plasma exchange

315
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:18,250
was much easier so

316
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,800
here in the USDA in America I think

317
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:24,700
there are about seventy percent of the

318
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:27,429
species which has been identified so at

319
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,800
the time when people could go to Brazil

320
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:32,799
to Argentina to South America to collect

321
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:35,289
they live apart there and bring some

322
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:38,439
today we're CA and also transferred to

323
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:40,990
other places what other banks after the

324
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:45,700
conventions this all became very

325
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:49,360
difficult to know to exchange in Brazil

326
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:51,670
and in Argentina national laws stop

327
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,220
researchers from sending native

328
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:55,839
materials abroad and make it actually

329
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,139
quite difficult to work it's quite

330
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,920
difficult to work with native materials

331
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:07,209
each was that has a amazing bank of

332
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:12,309
cultivated species of accession he has

333
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:16,420
the mandate to keep and to distribute he

334
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:18,490
has again some issues which are beyond

335
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,750
the scope of these of this talk so it's

336
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,740
very difficult to get material for my

337
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,240
cruiser to but the usta I mean we've

338
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,049
been having a lot of pleasure working

339
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,390
with the usta because they they have a

340
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:33,759
very well organized Bankers Trust parent

341
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:37,240
everything's online and it's very easy

342
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:39,460
to to get so if you make a request to

343
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,490
the USDA you get a little packet of 20

344
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:45,420
seeds and they're very very well

345
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:49,450
organized in obliging so you know it's

346
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:50,950
it's a very good bank and weird and it's

347
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,170
going to be very important to keep it

348
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,450
and we've been trying to work with the

349
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,220
usta and convince funders and everything

350
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,580
that it's important you keep it there

351
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:03,759
and the work we're doing producing new

352
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:06,519
tetraploid our our objective is to have

353
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,410
it all deposited in the USDA the work we

354
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:12,180
do here in the US so that is available

355
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,180
to the peanut community worldwide

356
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:20,079
so as expected while species have all

357
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:22,269
sorts of resistance to pests and

358
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,159
diseases so these are the main pests and

359
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:26,920
diseases of peanuts that somebody was

360
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:32,740
asking me today lately spot root-knot

361
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:36,820
nematode rust alpha toxin viruses etc so

362
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:40,420
for all of these some species have been

363
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:43,629
found to be resistant and in our work

364
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:46,600
and this is work from starting some

365
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:49,090
years back we found that Erica's nagano

366
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:52,959
which is a beer genomes vicious was

367
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:54,279
extremely resistant to rust well

368
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,900
actually this is not a ruckus magnet

369
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:58,329
this is peanut but this is just showing

370
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,920
what the Ross is like and Iraq extent of

371
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:06,099
sperm is very very resistant to nematode

372
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:08,800
amongst other things peanut not having a

373
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:12,189
very good either genetics to work with

374
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,919
not be polymorphic enough and not being

375
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:17,769
very resistant at all so let's work with

376
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:20,590
diploid to bring in resistances so how

377
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:26,319
can we understand where the resistances

378
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:30,339
are so remembering that peanut has a and

379
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:33,009
B genomes so we decided to tease out the

380
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:37,569
two genomes of peanut by using two

381
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:39,400
different deployed populations so across

382
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:42,159
a rocket appliances which is the

383
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,680
progenitor of peanut with the bee genome

384
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,670
species Iraqis do Renee's the progenitor

385
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:50,860
of the eight a part of sub genome with

386
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:54,160
the a janome species with an agostino

387
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:56,019
former and in parallel we created

388
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:01,000
populations for the a and for the beep

389
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:03,309
of these sides created maps phenotype

390
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,230
for not only visible for all sorts of

391
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:09,909
other traits identify cutie else created

392
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,789
markers for resistance link two

393
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:15,900
resistances and we can use these markers

394
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:19,509
now to do Marcus's selection with peanut

395
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,860
but obviously these plants are not very

396
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:24,490
useful because they are in the diploid

397
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:27,139
stage so what we do in parallel to it

398
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,710
creating the building bridges creating

399
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:34,130
plants which are actually compatible and

400
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:37,009
have harbor they are the resistances so

401
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:40,160
what we do is we cross a wild species

402
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:45,109
from a genome with the wild regional

403
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,730
species and artificially duplicate the

404
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:50,750
genome we use colchicine there are all

405
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:53,360
sorts of things you can use and the

406
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,160
synthetic plant now is now compatible

407
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,429
with peanut so we can use it directly

408
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,070
with process they are theoretically

409
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:03,110
stable not quite like that but they

410
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:10,039
supposed to be quite stable and we can

411
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:12,439
use them freely this is what all the

412
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:15,170
species which are theoretically

413
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:20,539
crossable with peanut once tetraploid

414
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:23,529
eyes these Iraqis appliances which falls

415
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:26,059
into the Iraqis hypogaea be genome clade

416
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:30,740
Iraq is the remains as it falls into the

417
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:33,559
auriga's hypogaea agent on clade these

418
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:38,390
are introns for different genomes the

419
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:40,220
genome size so these ones with the sign

420
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,009
are the ones that we have used in

421
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,380
crosses and we have obtained

422
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:47,329
successfully tetraploid sweet ride other

423
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,520
combinations but not everything is

424
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:52,579
possible there Dupri's I gotta get all

425
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,529
sorts of incompatibilities which we have

426
00:21:52,579 --> 00:22:00,919
never studied very much but we know they

427
00:21:54,529 --> 00:22:03,200
exist so we try to select the ones that

428
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:06,590
are closer to the to the beach to the

429
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,960
genome of hypogaea but we have been able

430
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:13,220
to get crosses from other more distant

431
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,789
species so we've done crosses in Brazil

432
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,259
we've then crosses here UGA we are in

433
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:20,899
collaboration with tiptoeing in

434
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:23,930
collaboration with Senegal and we've

435
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:27,530
created a number of plants which are

436
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:30,019
compatible with peanut and we are doing

437
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:33,069
back crosses here in the US in Brazil

438
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:33,069
and also in Senegal

439
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:41,269
these are the place where wild species

440
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:42,589
are being used in breeding programs the

441
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:48,019
ones in yellow are the ones we are

442
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:50,419
collaborating with and I'd like to go

443
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:53,240
into some specifics some aspects which

444
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,190
are very we find very interesting very

445
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,769
surprising very interesting to look at

446
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:00,650
when we duplicate the plants when we get

447
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:02,000
these two while together what happens to

448
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:06,019
them what happens in the genome what

449
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,210
happens what does the plant look like so

450
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:11,059
a lot of you here very familiar with

451
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:16,130
with all this concept of Nicola typic

452
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:18,200
facts of genomic merger etc so it's not

453
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:21,470
going to be surprising from a lot of you

454
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:25,730
but for us was fascinating so we get a

455
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:27,529
species which has a small leaf cross

456
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,539
with another one or you get duplicate

457
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:32,299
and you get a big leaf much more similar

458
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:34,250
to the tetraploid one and that doesn't

459
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:39,079
happen only once it happens in all the

460
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:42,349
crosses we look at the cell size in the

461
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:45,769
leaf so this is the guard cells here of

462
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:47,619
the deployed and look at the guard cells

463
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:52,160
on the tetraploid they're much larger

464
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:56,029
epidermal cells as well when we look at

465
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:59,060
photosynthetic pigments again so the

466
00:23:56,029 --> 00:24:02,660
yellow ones are the diploid green ones

467
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:06,079
are the synthetic tetraploid and blue is

468
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:10,759
peanut so what you can see is that once

469
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:14,289
we tetraploid eyes the diploid we get a

470
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:17,619
much greater level production of

471
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:17,619
photosynthetic pigments

472
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,100
and then what would be the effect on

473
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,329
drought because of course we've been

474
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:29,409
involved a number of projects that

475
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:31,509
involve drought and okay so let's look

476
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,630
at the wild they a lot of them are grown

477
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:37,920
in very dry environments so we could try

478
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:40,900
and find our lives from the wilds right

479
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:45,150
wrong so we find it is not quite like

480
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:48,370
that because and then I'll show you why

481
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:51,280
so when we look at drought how can you

482
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:52,899
compare the drought of a plant which is

483
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,329
a peanut which is a bushy plant which

484
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,340
has an architecture which is very

485
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:59,949
particular and compared with a plant

486
00:24:57,339 --> 00:25:02,349
which is craggy which has less branches

487
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,029
less leaves and you know how do you

488
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:07,509
compare you compare yields do you

489
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:09,849
compare growth jookin so we had to tease

490
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:12,009
it out a bit and find some traits which

491
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:16,379
would be common to peanut and to the

492
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:19,390
wild and one of them was the

493
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,070
transpiration rate so we did this work

494
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:23,470
in collaboration with Vincent videz as a

495
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:25,689
colleague from his friendship works a

496
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:29,319
tree cruiser to India he's doing a lot

497
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:32,350
of wonderful work with drought so we

498
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:36,159
looked at the transpiration rate on the

499
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:38,019
stress so this is one is 100 when you

500
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,720
the plant is in a pot one hundred

501
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:45,490
percent of water which is in field

502
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:48,220
capacity and these is zero water so the

503
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:51,430
fraction of trust parable soil water is

504
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,319
measured and this is the measurement of

505
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:56,440
the stress in the plant so this is the

506
00:25:53,319 --> 00:26:00,189
normalized transpiration so you have

507
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,740
this stage in which you stop you stop

508
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:06,160
watering the plant of all your water it

509
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:10,329
in in amounts that you know that the

510
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,810
soil is getting dry gradually and ease

511
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:16,720
observe the transpiration of the plant

512
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:18,519
compared to controls so what you think

513
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,009
really is the matter conductance how

514
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:25,029
this tomato is closing and how the plant

515
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:27,009
is reacting to the drought and these is

516
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:30,639
called a threshold in which the plant

517
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:31,250
stops really slows down transpiration

518
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,950
and risk

519
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:40,910
wants to be the drought imposed and well

520
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:43,460
the late to the plant closes to Martin

521
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:47,810
and sort of defend itself against the

522
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:50,690
drought obviously you wilt more the

523
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:53,899
plant loses more water but at the same

524
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:57,289
time it's producing photosynthesis so

525
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:06,019
it's a trade-off between photosynthesis

526
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:08,599
and transpiration so yeah so the

527
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:12,099
threshold when the begins to decline

528
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:14,869
show the water conservation of the plant

529
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:17,359
so we started looking at all the number

530
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:20,269
of wild species and comparison

531
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:23,179
tetraploid species and we see the deep

532
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:25,789
Lloyds are much more conservative than a

533
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,980
tetraploid at a tendency we've done lots

534
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:30,200
of tests and you'll see that it deployed

535
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:34,299
to start closing stomata mature earlier

536
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:38,140
then there then the peanuts and then the

537
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:41,000
synthetics then we started looking at

538
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:44,750
one combination of two diploid and

539
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,960
deeper in their synthetic and what to

540
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:49,640
see that the parental deployed closes to

541
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:55,880
matter earlier than the synthetic

542
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:57,860
tetraploid so we realize that there is a

543
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,630
lot of changes in the plant once it's

544
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:02,539
set up realized that's one of the

545
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:06,410
changes so we cannot infer what the

546
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:08,389
plant what type of drought tolerance the

547
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:10,640
plot is going to have a quadrature they

548
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,650
deployed you have to go through the

549
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,540
whole process of tetraploid Isaac first

550
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:16,880
and then you assess the plants then you

551
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:19,609
look at what what they're like so this

552
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:25,270
is another one of them for other the

553
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:25,269
time surprise of these tetraploid II

554
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:32,569
and the other surprise was some deceit

555
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:35,450
so everything grows the leaves a bigger

556
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:37,970
the plant is bigger and it produces more

557
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:40,940
big lens it produces more you know this

558
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:44,058
and the other so and the focus of peanut

559
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,200
is the seed so great we duplicate the

560
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:51,319
plant and we're going to have bigger

561
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:54,739
seeds right wrong so that's one of our

562
00:28:51,319 --> 00:29:01,729
sorrows out there you know why not why

563
00:28:54,739 --> 00:29:03,889
can't we have the biggest seed and again

564
00:29:01,729 --> 00:29:05,808
does not one cross one combination all

565
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:08,238
sorts of combinations we see the same

566
00:29:05,808 --> 00:29:11,418
thing this is a diploid this is the

567
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:14,149
synthetic tetraploid this is the rock is

568
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:17,028
meticulous a undomesticated form of

569
00:29:14,148 --> 00:29:20,358
peanut is one of the only tetraploid

570
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:22,069
species which are wild and these are

571
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:24,589
peanut peanuts different peanut

572
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:26,720
varieties of different seed size so we

573
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:29,778
see that's consistent the length the

574
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,690
width the way you know we don't see much

575
00:29:29,778 --> 00:29:36,288
change so if we had some discussions

576
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:37,460
about it we haven't figured out why but

577
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:42,019
that's one of the things that we've

578
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:46,639
we've been finding well the good thing

579
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:48,200
about it is once you cross this plant

580
00:29:46,638 --> 00:29:51,469
which is a tetraploid compatible with

581
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,798
peanut we get an F to population which

582
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:58,190
with a lot of segregation so it's not

583
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:01,638
all bad I know after a few rounds of

584
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:04,278
selection we find we can get recover you

585
00:30:01,638 --> 00:30:07,278
know plans which are you know we have

586
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:10,009
good resistant and also have good seed

587
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:13,220
size even larger than the original

588
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:15,739
recurrent parent so it's not all bad we

589
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:20,659
will manage to overcome that quite quite

590
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:23,298
easily so we looked at over 30 traits

591
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:25,840
and we find consistent changes with your

592
00:30:23,298 --> 00:30:25,839
ploy d

593
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,819
so what happens in genome structure now

594
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:37,700
once we look well the plan changes so

595
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:40,189
what happens in the genome so I'd like

596
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:43,430
to point out that after a lot of work

597
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:46,519
trying to find Marcus as far as I know

598
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:49,549
ten tetraploid maps have been created so

599
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:52,279
far the top ones are the ones our group

600
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:56,960
is involved with and these are later on

601
00:30:52,279 --> 00:31:00,259
and all of them they follow the

602
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,880
assumption that peanut is a nulla

603
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:05,029
tetraploid with this symmetric

604
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:09,440
combination so all of these use this

605
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:13,430
classic a low tetraploid model in which

606
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,130
you have the a janome let's say and the

607
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:20,060
bed you know and the recombination

608
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:21,920
happens independently so we have

609
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:27,799
recombination the a side and

610
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:30,680
recombination the B side and what we

611
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:35,509
found well this is it's a work we've

612
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:38,299
done recently we we had data sets from

613
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:40,519
different maps and we found that some

614
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:43,309
mark has behaved not the way we expected

615
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:48,019
it to so it doesn't really follow the

616
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:49,519
day stomach model and we looked at these

617
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:51,410
marks and we thought these the market

618
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,359
they don't work very well they haven't

619
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:56,000
simplified very well or the DNA is not

620
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:58,519
working and a lot of it would just

621
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,230
ignore so a lot of what we do when we

622
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,629
don't have an explanation we just have

623
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:05,299
to ignore a move on otherwise we stay on

624
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:08,810
forever in the same problem so a lot of

625
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:12,500
the markers we just know pushed under

626
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:16,220
the carpet we just ignored this is one

627
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:21,160
example of of a step marker so if we are

628
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:24,700
we are evaluating the a side we expect

629
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:27,300
only three groups

630
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:32,440
and look at the side we expect just a a

631
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:37,169
SC or CC okay look at a side AC you see

632
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:41,769
a a AC or CC not more than that but

633
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:44,560
often we found some markers which some

634
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:48,609
I'm not supposed to be there why do you

635
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:54,299
have this group here and you can only

636
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:56,649
explain with this model so we probably I

637
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:59,230
having recombination between the a and

638
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:02,380
the B genomes and these we found

639
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:04,390
consistently once we sort of click that

640
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:07,360
was about two years ago about two years

641
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:10,840
ago actually we were in pack and I saw a

642
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,699
talk on potato and I thought hang on

643
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:16,109
it's something here that maybe we are

644
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:20,049
missing so we look back at all our data

645
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:23,589
micro satellite data slip date and also

646
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:25,839
expression analysis data and you know

647
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:29,589
we've found that these strange markers

648
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:31,569
they were grouping into similar

649
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:34,750
positions in the chromosomes the linkage

650
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:38,470
groups so what we find here the green

651
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:41,950
parts are areas where we have Tetris

652
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:45,160
sonic for a genome so we have a higher

653
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:48,279
dosage of the a and no Lee sonic for the

654
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:51,640
B and the red is d'etre sonic for B and

655
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:54,519
knowledge sonic for a so yeah we started

656
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:58,090
looking at this data and this is a cross

657
00:33:54,519 --> 00:34:00,220
between a peanut variety and a synthetic

658
00:33:58,089 --> 00:34:03,879
a litter ployed so we could easily

659
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:07,350
establish that you know these is a

660
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,350
segmental a lot i deployed

661
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:15,320
so we at the time of you know sequencing

662
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:17,599
the genome the of appliance and do the

663
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,280
names is if this was some April

664
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,259
combination a big problem is it a big

665
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,419
issue is a small issue how do we deal

666
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,649
with it how we're going to create what

667
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:26,628
are the new models we are going to use

668
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:28,730
with to have an answer that but what new

669
00:34:26,628 --> 00:34:32,029
models we are going to use to start

670
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:33,320
mapping peanuts now how we're going to

671
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:39,730
how is that going to affect our breeding

672
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:43,010
programs how in effect a selection so

673
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,599
the first peanut genome which is all

674
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:49,000
extra peanut but is the peanut

675
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:51,429
progenitors have been recently sequenced

676
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,789
versions of it have been available since

677
00:34:51,429 --> 00:35:01,490
2004 and is a multinational initiative

678
00:34:55,789 --> 00:35:06,019
and because peanut is a lot a triploid

679
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:08,589
the two sub genomes are so similar we

680
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:11,929
decided as a group to sequence the two

681
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:15,410
progenitors Iraqis if Isis in Iraq is

682
00:35:11,929 --> 00:35:22,099
the rain ances and that's as I said has

683
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:24,170
been deposited in peanut base is it's

684
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:27,679
been freely available for almost three

685
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:31,300
years now and it's being curated by the

686
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:34,190
group of safe cannon from Iowa State and

687
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:37,160
you know that's being a very good source

688
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:41,570
of information form for the hope in the

689
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:43,789
community so we decided you know now we

690
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:50,510
can start entry some of these questions

691
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:53,210
with a with a genome so we know that the

692
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:55,960
crosses that involve wild species have a

693
00:35:53,210 --> 00:36:00,019
good degree of tetra sonic recombination

694
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:03,650
but how much of that actually happens or

695
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:06,409
affect peanuts genetics because once you

696
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:08,660
have wilds you may have one or more wild

697
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:13,399
things going on but how about peanut

698
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:15,699
itself so we did some short read alumina

699
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,070
sequence some skin sequencing from

700
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:21,259
several peanut genotypes then we mapped

701
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,010
those sequences because we're going to

702
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,610
have a mix of

703
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:29,410
a and B sub genome so we map them onto

704
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:32,300
the dura 97 applies to the molecules and

705
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:38,179
so we designed some plots some random

706
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:44,240
plots of these sequences so if we have

707
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:49,129
which is the expected model of a and B

708
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:50,959
in the same dosage will get a plot like

709
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:58,190
these because we have the normalized

710
00:36:50,960 --> 00:37:00,500
density a and B equals 1 but if we have

711
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:03,170
something that deviates that deviates

712
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,670
from this model again the plots are

713
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:09,800
going to be different so if you have

714
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:12,710
four of be when a density goes higher

715
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:16,400
and the a goes lower so this is a very

716
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:19,699
simple plot that i'm going to show you

717
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,680
they the ones in real life now so with

718
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:22,909
sequins about for two genotypes i'm not

719
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:27,609
going to show this here going to show

720
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:27,609
one genotype and three linkage groups

721
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:39,920
these are linkage group one what we see

722
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:43,820
is most of it is one so we see along

723
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:47,599
with most of the linkage group you see

724
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:51,530
us the same dosage 4a and 4b there is

725
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,719
some small deletions or maybe gene

726
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:56,560
conversion something we we shouldn't

727
00:37:53,719 --> 00:38:01,639
know what they are but you can see small

728
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:04,389
variation along the chromosome linkage

729
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:07,670
group for is a total different thing

730
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:12,579
these linkage group for is harbors lots

731
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:15,619
of rj's a lot of resistance genes it's

732
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:17,989
their highly collinear the a and the B

733
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:22,759
link chromosome for Zaha lakhani

734
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:25,489
collinear and we see here the end low

735
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:29,420
dosage for a then low dosage should be

736
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:30,979
then for a again so there has been a lot

737
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,570
of recombination going on there between

738
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:36,630
the children ohms

739
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:40,019
and we see a similar thing in linkage

740
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:43,200
group 5 so in we should see about 6

741
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:46,920
million base pairs of the Rossoneri

742
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:49,368
combination so we're starting to analyze

743
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,440
this data but we already see a lot of

744
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:55,670
very interesting information and also

745
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,829
they vary between different cultivars

746
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:01,260
since we are looking at different or

747
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:03,299
tank of varieties we start to see some

748
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,280
trends for the different varieties and

749
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:08,010
we also see some transport Arrakis

750
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:13,920
monticola which is the wild tetraploid

751
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:15,960
peanut so we are beginning to think that

752
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,119
this you know this shoe this issue is

753
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:21,240
quite large is larger than we expected

754
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,190
so but if you're happy or sad about it

755
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:28,618
but it's something completely unexpected

756
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:30,090
and quite interesting and again that's

757
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,490
something of a beginning to touch now

758
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:34,890
what are the effects of tetrapod ization

759
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:37,349
on gene expression again a few of you

760
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:39,989
here very familiar with the whole

761
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:42,269
concept or of differences in gene

762
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:44,159
expression when you have general merger

763
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:46,679
when you have deployed Isaiah tetek

764
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:49,139
realization etc but it's something that

765
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:53,039
we are just beginning to investigate and

766
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:55,440
we have a very very nice model for it

767
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:58,940
because we have the two progenitors of

768
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,309
peanut Iraqis appliance and ordinances

769
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:04,139
recently created new deployed hybrids so

770
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:05,759
we are able to look at the diploid

771
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:08,639
hybrid before you weren't able to

772
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,940
because we thought the diploid high

773
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,779
didn't mean anything we throw them away

774
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,550
obviously they're different plants

775
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,070
difficult plans to keep because you hey

776
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:19,619
don't produce seed so you have to keep

777
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:23,100
them very attractive lease and not often

778
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:26,460
are you able to do that so now with the

779
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:28,130
new know a bit more about it we look at

780
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,809
this plants and with a different light

781
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:32,640
we have new synthetic a lot i deployed

782
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:35,989
because before we thought they were

783
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:39,929
completely stable now we are not so sure

784
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:42,929
we have synthetic a lot i deployed 10th

785
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:43,919
generation so we can see roughly what

786
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:47,548
happened along

787
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,950
all these rounds of selfie we also have

788
00:40:47,548 --> 00:40:52,739
a rugged meticulous with is the one

789
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:55,379
species of peanut of wild peanut which

790
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:58,139
is tetraploid and it's probably a

791
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,539
pharaoh species of Pharaoh relative of

792
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:03,239
peanut and it could be what can it look

793
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:06,150
like thousands of years ago and then we

794
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:10,108
have peanut so we have a very nice model

795
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:12,720
to work with so we did RNA seek of

796
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:16,429
leaves mapped on again or to the drone n

797
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:18,719
so then applying student molecules and

798
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:22,259
you know these plots that i'm going to

799
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,909
show what I made them on saturday so

800
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,910
it's completely out of the oven

801
00:41:23,909 --> 00:41:30,568
completely new so with you're trying to

802
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:35,159
understand what's going on this is the

803
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:37,259
genome so linkage group one again one of

804
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:41,279
the peanut cultivars not much going on

805
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:47,780
here but if you can see the new deployed

806
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:52,040
hybrid completely dominance okay and

807
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:55,640
then what happens when the tetrapod eyes

808
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:59,489
and you have a very good a and B balance

809
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:01,710
so we may need to saturate this data bit

810
00:41:59,489 --> 00:42:04,289
and you know do some more tweaking but

811
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:05,880
it's quite clear here that you know

812
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:08,548
something really dramatic is happening

813
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:12,180
between the stage of depolarization to

814
00:42:08,548 --> 00:42:15,358
the cutter polarization these are 10th

815
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:17,578
generation these are different synthetic

816
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,949
to these of the same parentals but done

817
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:22,019
at different times and the 10th

818
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:26,250
generation we don't see much dominance

819
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:30,929
at all these Iraqis Mon ticular which is

820
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:32,400
a wild species of peanut and peanut so

821
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:34,739
you know we can have a look at

822
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,650
domestication something happened here

823
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:40,048
but not much so possibly they were very

824
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:43,380
unstable in the first generations and

825
00:42:40,048 --> 00:42:47,818
then later on you know there's complete

826
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:49,789
balance of the two sub genomes have you

827
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:51,989
looked look at linkage group for in

828
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:55,300
which you have a lot of treacherous

829
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:58,669
ohmic recombination here the ends

830
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:02,420
again linkage group for the new deployed

831
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:08,809
hybrids again complete one more complete

832
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:16,309
but a very good be dominance again when

833
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:19,400
is catalyzed days a be balanced now look

834
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:21,170
at the 10th generation okay these

835
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,460
doesn't come here okay there's a direct

836
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:25,849
thing because this is from a different

837
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:28,250
cross but what you can see is this base

838
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:31,039
plundered we've had for ten ten

839
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:34,030
generations look very stable looks

840
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:36,610
completely the same as ten years ago

841
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:40,220
when you look at the linkage group for

842
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:43,820
you see complete a dominance won almost

843
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:49,639
complete a dominance but not quite so

844
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:54,440
but that's not because this is not you

845
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:57,079
know a gene expression thing is it this

846
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,450
genomic so we we had some work before

847
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:01,849
there that we looked at there's complete

848
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:06,439
little suamico combination here so this

849
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:09,769
is more genomic event and looking at

850
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:13,099
Iraq is meticulous you see at the ends

851
00:44:09,769 --> 00:44:14,780
the same signature of Tetris ohmic

852
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:19,130
recombination we see in a raucous

853
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:22,970
monticola and we also saw the same very

854
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:26,059
similar signature in peanut so clearly

855
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:28,189
there's a very preliminary results but

856
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:30,619
we are beginning to unravel very

857
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:33,380
interesting factors here I mean we some

858
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:37,000
things that seem to be very stable along

859
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:39,260
thousands of years and you see a lot of

860
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,989
great instability in the first

861
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,310
generations so there's a lot more work

862
00:44:41,989 --> 00:44:48,329
to be done but it's you know it's

863
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:51,440
something we are very excited about so

864
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:54,449
go through the sorrows and joys and

865
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,099
surprises the first sorrow is peanuts

866
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:58,349
and Alex tetraploid with very low

867
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:01,199
genetic diversity and very poor disease

868
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:03,659
resistance so we've been crying like my

869
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:06,059
son with his foot stuck in here on the

870
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:08,429
bench because we felt completely stuck

871
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:11,519
for a number of years but haven't should

872
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:15,750
go forward and and you know get along

873
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:19,199
with it so the Prickett part is peanut

874
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:21,360
peanut has a more complex genetics then

875
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,819
we expected before so it's quite prickly

876
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:27,390
as a surprise but again it's something

877
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,980
we can deal with and and we're having a

878
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:31,679
lot of success in improving disease

879
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,780
resistance with wild alleles now with

880
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:36,659
the new genome sequence we can you know

881
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:41,510
go much fasting is much much better much

882
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:45,509
nice to work with then previously so

883
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:47,400
that's what wants to show you and I want

884
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:50,160
to acknowledge the funders of this

885
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,070
research and and the group have been

886
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,659
working with this is my colleague

887
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,940
partner husband that we've been working

888
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:58,889
with for the last 15 years on this on

889
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:02,159
this research has been you know great

890
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:04,559
joy to work with David Bowie early these

891
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,929
are my is the quorum it is many more

892
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,750
people than these students postdocs but

893
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:11,279
this is the core group in Brazil and

894
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:13,949
like like should point to their vows

895
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,530
who's the one who's been collecting and

896
00:46:13,949 --> 00:46:20,909
organizing the gym class banks and he's

897
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:22,590
a great asset to to have and this is the

898
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:25,379
wonderful group of being we have in the

899
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:26,910
pleasure to work with him the US and I'd

900
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,309
like to point out Scott Jackson who's

901
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:33,059
our host friend and again we've been

902
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:35,480
having great joy working with and thank

903
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:35,480
you very much

904
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:47,219
I'll ask you starters have you made any

905
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:50,099
auto temperance no we have not now we

906
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:53,519
have not to yeah whether you get some of

907
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:57,089
the same qualities and it costs those to

908
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:58,800
make you yes yeah there have been some

909
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:00,870
experts some crazy experiments we

910
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,900
thought about and we like making

911
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:05,819
octopodes all auto-generate so that's

912
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,430
there will be some things that we

913
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:11,490
thought of doing but because we are very

914
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:13,769
much interested in application and you

915
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:15,839
know all the crosses we make we are

916
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:18,119
looking at the science behind it but we

917
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,610
are always looking at if you can get

918
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,920
some product of the other line from them

919
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:26,400
I was at hand specifically about the

920
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,710
issue of the variability between deploys

921
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,230
and the tetraploid States copy the tetra

922
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:33,059
Floyd's first could you then assess cure

923
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:35,730
disease resistance or other qualities

924
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:38,639
and then right ok so duplicate the two

925
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:41,269
deploys and then crossing yes yeah I

926
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:41,269
could have yeah

927
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:48,170
today occasionally

928
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,889
are you fighting it though

929
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,000
when you find that there are really

930
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,000
infected

931
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
there

932
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:16,000
capture or you

933
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:16,000
many different

934
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:22,750
right great yes yeah well obviously

935
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:24,099
pro-thaksin is a some today's interest a

936
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:28,739
lot of people from different crops as

937
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:32,530
well our group we haven't done work

938
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:35,348
directly with aflatoxin ourselves what

939
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:37,330
we've done is we created some tetraploid

940
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:38,769
and in collaboration with senegal

941
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:40,389
they've been looking at they've been

942
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:42,880
done been doing field trials for

943
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:46,118
diseases and they've been assessing up a

944
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:50,950
toxin and i think what they're finding

945
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:55,450
is that some of these i think they are

946
00:48:50,949 --> 00:48:58,839
bc they have they have segmental lines

947
00:48:55,449 --> 00:49:01,750
they have some advanced lines a lot of

948
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:05,230
the lines are more more resistant than

949
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:08,050
the recurrent parent but they find their

950
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:10,090
face these small be additive effect and

951
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:13,289
they are they don't have anything of

952
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:19,900
major effect everything is additive and

953
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:23,019
of small effect to the organelle genomes

954
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:26,880
play any role

955
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:26,880
the success of the crosses

956
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:34,019
yeah he's something we haven't looked at

957
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,019
no we haven't looked at

958
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:49,960
yes

959
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,960
actually have a difference

960
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:55,329
they're universal yes yes yes it's a

961
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,969
phase is puzzling because it's I think

962
00:49:55,329 --> 00:50:00,159
it involved independently in other two

963
00:49:57,969 --> 00:50:02,108
taxane in legumes but they are not

964
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,358
necessarily related to two rockets at

965
00:50:02,108 --> 00:50:07,029
all so vigna subterranea is one of them

966
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:09,340
and it's far away and all the Rockets

967
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:12,240
features have sought erroneous routes

968
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,240
yeah

969
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:24,680
but if you correct on

970
00:50:21,929 --> 00:50:24,679
you know me

971
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,858
and spread them

972
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:36,159
yeah well that's a great question so

973
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:38,289
obviously what we are showing here were

974
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,879
two different things in 11 was the

975
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:41,769
genetic side of it the other way the

976
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,380
expression so we haven't corrected that

977
00:50:41,769 --> 00:50:48,750
yet so that's that's one of the next

978
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,750
steps to do absolutely yeah

979
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:59,869
no no there isn't any ruckus species

980
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:01,429
that is haploid that we know so we've

981
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:05,240
been working and all these fishes that

982
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:12,828
are in the Iraqis section it will work

983
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:14,868
with across the bow are deployed this

984
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:19,750
has been a production of Cornell

985
00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:19,750
University on the web at cornell edu
