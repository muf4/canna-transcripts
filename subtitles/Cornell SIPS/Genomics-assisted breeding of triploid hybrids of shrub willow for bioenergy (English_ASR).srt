1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,879
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:12,960
University so I'm going to do my best to

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,278
use the the Mouse as a pointer here so

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,880
that everyone can see in both

5
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:22,000
locations uh it's my great pleasure to

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:26,678
uh give an overview of our

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,359
research uh I'm going to touch

8
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:31,959
on a number of projects uh that we got

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,000
going but there are a number of projects

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,960
that I don't have time uh to get

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,480
to and I'm going to break up my talk

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,480
into four sections here so here's an an

13
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,799
overview of what I'm going to talk about

14
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:50,159
starting with the most applied and

15
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,280
ending with the most uh basic aspects of

16
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,959
our

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,160
research we start by talking about uh

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,160
the overall agronomic system of growing

19
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,679
shrub Willow as a bio energy crop give

20
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:05,399
an overview of our breeding program and

21
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:06,079
some of the unique aspects of breeding

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,400
uh

23
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:15,158
Willow I'll talk about our emerging

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:18,280
resources for uh mapping in Willow both

25
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,240
qtl mapping and Association mapping and

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,439
then get to a project that's funded by

27
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,959
the department of energy uh their feed

28
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:28,118
Stock genomics Program uh where we're

29
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:31,039
trying to look at the genomic basis for

30
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:33,879
heterosis in triploid hybrids of

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,640
Willow so this is the typical land that

32
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:41,679
we target uh to grow Willow on uh Willow

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,040
as a pioneer species will do well on

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:50,399
marginal Agland and uh it is a crop that

35
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,880
we uh aim to avoid the conflict uh

36
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,000
between food and fuel uh by targeting

37
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,078
underutilized or abandoned Agland uh so

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,959
this is a site at Vernon Verona Cheryl

39
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:05,319
High School near Rome New York uh that

40
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:09,038
is typical of a lot of the abandoned or

41
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:11,478
underutilized Agland in uh the Northeast

42
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,478
and Upper

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,800
Midwest with Willow we can convert that

44
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:24,159
uh marginally profitable land back to uh

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,120
more conventional agriculture although

46
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:30,079
very low input and very low labor

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,200
requiring agriculture uh so we planted

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:38,800
Willow at the high school here in uh

49
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:40,919
2010 I'm sorry in uh spring of 2009 and

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,000
this is what it looked like uh by

51
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,399
October of

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,080
2010 uh at that high school they have a

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,200
very active uh FFA program uh where they

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,840
make maple syrup and they're actually

55
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:58,079
harvesting the willow to burn in their

56
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,080
evaporators uh while they make maple

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,080
syrup

58
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,639
so here's an overview of the willow

59
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:10,798
agronomic

60
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:13,919
system uh we are aiming to uh develop

61
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,319
conservation tillage as a method of site

62
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,439
preparation you see here that uh the

63
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,598
first thing we have to do is kill the

64
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:23,199
existing

65
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,959
vegetation and uh as a part of that for

66
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,759
both weed management and nutrient

67
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,519
management uh Eric Fabio in my lab is

68
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,000
doing a lot of work on uh first planting

69
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,400
cover crops as a part of that site

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,400
preparation but we've also been working

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,158
with agenetic a company in Rochester uh

72
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,120
to use GPS guidance uh for Zone tillage

73
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:48,679
which is uh what you see here uh

74
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,759
followed up by uh GPS guided planting

75
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,438
using one of these mechanical Planters

76
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:56,120
this one was built in

77
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:58,719
Denmark so we're planting uh dormant

78
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,599
cuting stem cuttings here these are

79
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:04,878
whips that are about 7 or 8 ft long that

80
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:07,359
the planter will cut into 8 in pieces

81
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:10,598
and push into the ground as it moves

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,640
along we plant in a double row system

83
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:16,120
with 30 in between the rows with either

84
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,879
a five or a 6ft Alley between those

85
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,959
double rows uh with 2 feet between the

86
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:25,360
plants giving us uh a planting density

87
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:28,720
of about 6,000 plants per

88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,520
acre those plants will uh those cuting

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,880
will root fairly readily and uh push

90
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,000
buds to make new choots that will grow

91
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,038
about 5 or 6 feet tall by the end of

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,439
that establishment year and uh we take

93
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:44,399
advantage of the natural biology of

94
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,160
Willow by cutting them back or

95
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,519
compassing them which then stimulates

96
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,800
vigorous regrowth in the start of that

97
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,560
second

98
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,199
year so while we uh discard the biomass

99
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,120
that's produced in that establishment

100
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,960
year uh once those plants are

101
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,879
established they will vigorously

102
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,680
resprout after each cut

103
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:08,918
back by the end of that first year after

104
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,639
Copus or the second year of of

105
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:16,478
production on that site uh we typically

106
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:19,000
have growth of 12 to 15 feet tall and

107
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,038
our normal production cycle would go on

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,560
a three-year Harvest

109
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,199
Rotation by which time the plants are 20

110
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,079
to 25 ft

111
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,360
tall we harvest in the winter time

112
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,359
typically we're planting on poorly

113
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,240
drained sites that are wet uh so in the

114
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,759
winter it uh is an advantage uh to have

115
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,840
the ground Frozen it's a time when uh

116
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,319
forage Harvesters like this New Holland

117
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:49,560
forage Harvester are not typically being

118
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:51,400
used uh so that uh harvesting operation

119
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,360
can switch off their corn harvesting

120
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:56,599
head and put on a willow cutter head and

121
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,280
continue to use that Machinery through

122
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,080
the winter it's a time when we need

123
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,679
chips for heating and obviously it's the

124
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,240
time when the plants are dormant so it's

125
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,000
a good time to cut them back and you see

126
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,639
that all the leaves have fallen uh so

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,839
and and returned back to the soil uh

128
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,639
recycling those nutrients in the leaves

129
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:19,918
back to the to the

130
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,879
soil uh that those wood chips then would

131
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:25,478
be collected blown into a truck taken to

132
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,519
the conversion facility uh here you see

133
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:30,879
a whole truck dumper at a power plant uh

134
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:33,038
just north of Rome New York uh where

135
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,879
they're piling up chips uh to load into

136
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,240
their

137
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,439
boiler again that following spring the

138
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,079
plants would vigorously resprout

139
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:45,160
starting a new growth cycle a new year a

140
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,120
new three-year Harvest cycle we modeled

141
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,479
the economics based on seven of these

142
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,360
three-year Harvest Cycles but there's

143
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,199
good evidence from Sweden that uh yield

144
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,038
is

145
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,680
maintained uh for at least 10 Harvest

146
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:02,199
Cycles so there's really no no end in

147
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,280
sight in the productivity of a willow

148
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,280
Plantation once it's

149
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,680
established that biomass can be used in

150
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,960
a number of different conversion

151
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,319
processes uh here in New York state we

152
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:19,638
have three woodf fired power plants uh

153
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,120
and Willow is uh more than adequate fuel

154
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,680
for those power

155
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,639
plants uh there is an Emerging Market uh

156
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,918
for feed stocks for liquid

157
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,680
Transportation fuels and in fact the uh

158
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,159
US government has set some very

159
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,639
aggressive targets uh to produce 20

160
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,080
billion gallon 20 billion billion

161
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,759
gallons of uh Advanced renewable

162
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,120
biofuels uh by 2022 we're nowhere close

163
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,680
to getting to that point uh because the

164
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,598
technology for that conversion is

165
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,800
lagging behind and is quite expensive at

166
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:59,120
this point compared to uh

167
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,079
petroleum another viable Market that we

168
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,240
have in the Northeast is to use wood for

169
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,279
renewable Heating and this is a

170
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,280
smallscale boiler that uh We've

171
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,559
installed here in Geneva to heat two of

172
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:14,198
our buildings entirely fueled by Willow

173
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:18,360
Willow can also readily be pelletized

174
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:20,360
and used in uh in uh pellet stoves or

175
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,598
pellet

176
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,879
boilers we've done a fair amount of work

177
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,519
to look at the wood composition of

178
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,360
Willow that composition will be critical

179
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,478
for many of these liquid biofuels

180
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,120
conversion

181
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:39,278
methods uh it's not so critical but but

182
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,959
even still uh ther thermochemical

183
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,918
conversion combustion uh or

184
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:46,799
thermochemical conversion to liquid

185
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,439
Transportation fuels will also have its

186
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,359
own optimal biomass composition and we

187
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,360
see quite a bit of variation in biomass

188
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,639
composition uh among our different

189
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,839
varieties in our breeding program so

190
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,720
unfortunately that's about all that I

191
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:04,079
have time to talk about in terms of uh

192
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,839
biomass composition but it is a critical

193
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:11,759
trait uh for these different conversion

194
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,600
systems uh just to emphasize that uh

195
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,439
Willow is a viable commercial crop and

196
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,639
that the government is invested in

197
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:25,320
developing Willow as a crop uh in 2011

198
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:28,559
the USDA initiated uh a

199
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,959
program uh to plant uh to provide

200
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,039
planting Subs for Willow in Northern New

201
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,799
York

202
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,639
specifically uh this overall program is

203
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,120
called the biomass crop assistance

204
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:43,919
program and our area in New York among

205
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:49,759
these uh uh nine counties I believe it

206
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:52,679
is uh is specifically to pay 75% of the

207
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:55,600
establishment cost to plant Willow uh

208
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:58,078
provide an annual land payment and to

209
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,759
link the Harvest of that Willow with

210
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:03,799
conversion in local uh Power Plant

211
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,039
facilities these three Woodfired power

212
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:09,000
plants that I talked about uh one at

213
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:11,719
Fort Drum called Black River this one

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,519
just north of Rome uh the lion sale

215
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,000
power plant and one up near MSA the

216
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,959
shatay power

217
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,278
plant uh and those power plants are then

218
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,958
paying uh a contract price uh set by the

219
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,078
uh bcap

220
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:31,879
program so we have about 1, 1200 Acres

221
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,799
about 500 hect STS or so of shrub Willow

222
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:38,919
uh in commercial production in New York

223
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:40,278
State uh there's about uh 20,000 acres

224
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:43,919
in production in

225
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:47,480
Sweden uh in Denmark in England uh

226
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:51,278
growing production in Poland uh and

227
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,440
Ukraine uh Hungary so uh it is a viable

228
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,320
commercial crop uh being developed for

229
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,920
renewable

230
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,120
energy so that sort of summarizes our uh

231
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:04,439
production system or

232
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,560
agronomics uh again just want to point

233
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,000
out that there are significant barriers

234
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:13,479
to adoption of Willow uh including the

235
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,120
high cost of establishment the cost of

236
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:20,320
cutting production is a limiting factor

237
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,039
uh compared to seed production such uh

238
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,079
such as for switch

239
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,958
grass uh it is a system that needs

240
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:29,879
specialized planting and harvesting

241
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:32,799
equipment which most of which is built

242
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:35,799
in Europe New Holland has invested in

243
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,639
developing their own uh Willow cutter

244
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:42,039
head that uh is matched with their

245
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,039
self-propelled forage Harvesters uh but

246
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:47,559
still there is a lack of commercially

247
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:51,278
available planting and harvesting

248
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:54,399
equipment the key uh point that uh leads

249
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:57,399
into the next section of my talk is that

250
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,240
the economics of of biomass production

251
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,480
of Willow is dramatically improved

252
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,278
improved when we get increased yields

253
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,079
per acre as you can

254
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:09,039
imagine so breeding for improved

255
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:11,719
yield uh for more stable production

256
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:14,120
across marginal sites is a critical

257
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,680
factor for the long-term adoption of

258
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,679
Willow as a renewable energy

259
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:23,319
source so I'm going to move into talking

260
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,040
about uh our Willow breeding program

261
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,399
first of all establishing our goals

262
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,958
first goal well the first three goals

263
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,159
are all yield

264
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,838
uh as I just mentioned fitting that into

265
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:38,159
the economics of the system the more you

266
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,320
yield per acre uh the more uh we will

267
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,600
encourage

268
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,240
adoption it is a perennial crop that

269
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,079
will stay in the ground for as long as

270
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,759
30 years so longterm uh durable Pest and

271
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,679
disease resistance is critical as I

272
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,838
mentioned Uh Wood composition is a

273
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,759
critical aspect for uh matching feed

274
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,440
stocks to conversion

275
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:01,679
technology and we also always need be

276
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,240
conscious of the cost of cutting

277
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:09,198
production and uh stool form and plant

278
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,879
form Crown form uh branching for

279
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,919
example uh is a critical aspect for

280
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:15,399
efficient cutting production as well as

281
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,120
harvesting

282
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:21,839
efficiency we're now moving into looking

283
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,039
at uh aspects of stress tolerance as

284
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,519
well for particularly marginal sites and

285
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:28,519
I'll show you that uh one type of site

286
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,839
we're very interested in is reclaim

287
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:34,320
minland in Pennsylvania and West

288
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,639
Virginia so keeping all of these goals

289
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,160
in mind and underlying premise that we

290
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,959
work with is that we want to maintain a

291
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,639
genetically diverse Suite of pedigrees

292
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,078
among our commercially deployed

293
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:50,600
cultivars uh since we are planting

294
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,599
clonal material we always want to

295
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,120
maintain a high level of genetic

296
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:59,879
diversity in the field uh to hedge

297
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:04,440
against any uh individual cul of our

298
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:06,720
failure due to Pest and disease

299
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,199
susceptibility so our overall approach

300
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,879
and strategy in breeding Willow is to

301
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,319
rely on species hybridization and the

302
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,240
hybrid Vigor or

303
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,519
heterosis uh that we observe in species

304
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,799
hybrids so here I've got uh pictures of

305
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:26,240
three people who have been critical over

306
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,278
the years uh in actually doing the

307
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,560
controlled

308
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:33,759
pollinations uh and the cross that we've

309
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:36,159
done starting in 1998 and 99 uh Rich cop

310
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:40,240
who was one of my PhD students at Sunni

311
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:42,838
ESF really developed our techniques for

312
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,480
uh extracting pollen doing controlled

313
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,720
pollinations in the greenhouse did our

314
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,039
initial uh

315
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:54,040
hybridizations and many of our current

316
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:57,078
commercial cultivars are uh genotypes

317
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:59,879
that rich bread uh many of which we've

318
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:03,359
now patented

319
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:05,519
uh Kim Cameron took over for Rich and

320
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,399
did a number of very successful crosses

321
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,278
in 2002 through

322
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,519
2005 uh which I'm going to talk about as

323
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,919
well uh working as a postto in my lab

324
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,480
first at ESF and then helping me move

325
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:23,439
here to

326
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,680
Cornell and more recently uh Sam Noka

327
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,160
who was a Hobart student helped out in

328
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,799
the greenhouse over the last two years

329
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,600
helping to uh manage and maintain

330
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:36,599
thousands of seedlings in the greenhouse

331
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:39,639
he was a a real asset to

332
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,360
us so one of the features of salx and

333
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:45,759
I'm going to distinguish salx from

334
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:49,199
populus uh the two main species in the

335
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,600
salic AC one of the features of seix is

336
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:54,958
the tremendous species diversity uh that

337
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,079
we see in that genus there are over 300

338
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,000
species of salx while in populace there

339
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:02,359
are only I think 34 different speci

340
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,240
species and they range from dwarf

341
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:09,278
sprawling uh Alpine shrubs uh to you

342
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,079
know the weeping willow or black willow

343
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:15,559
trees that we're familiar with we work

344
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:18,120
exclusively with uh species in the

345
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:20,559
subgenus vitrix which are primarily

346
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,720
shrub form Willow they grow with

347
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:26,559
multiple small diameter stems never

348
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,519
really uh achieving a single stem uh

349
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,559
like the tree form Willows do

350
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,078
and in particular we're working

351
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:38,399
primarily within the section Helix and

352
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:40,758
making crosses with the section Dion uh

353
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,399
but you see there is great potential for

354
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,360
species hybridization here another

355
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:49,240
feature that's unique about cix

356
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,959
especially compared to populus is the

357
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,039
abundance of polyol across the genus and

358
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,439
in this particular scheme of species

359
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,599
that we work with in our breeding

360
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:04,000
program you'll see that cix may be

361
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,120
from Japan is Teto a natural Teto and

362
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,558
seasic Clos very common in the European

363
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:14,038
reading programs is hexaploid while all

364
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,038
all the other species here are

365
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,160
diploids uh I'm going to talk about some

366
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:23,720
of our genomics and we focused in on

367
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:26,839
seix peria as a reference genome uh for

368
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,960
our initial uh genome sequencing efforts

369
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:32,159
it is a central species in our breeding

370
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,319
program it is a consistent diploid but

371
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,120
you can see that it is a good species to

372
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:41,678
hybridize with uh many of the other

373
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:44,879
species in section Helix and also uh

374
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,919
across sections here with members of

375
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,520
themen I'm also going to talk about in

376
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:55,320
our work on triploids uh crosses between

377
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:57,960
seix peria and salx Miana as well as

378
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:01,038
crosses between seix Vialis which is the

379
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:05,079
main uh species in the European Willow

380
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:06,839
breeding programs and salx Mayana as you

381
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:09,279
can imagine these crosses between

382
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:12,639
tetraploids and diploids will generate

383
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,480
triploid progyny and that will be a an

384
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,640
ongoing theme here through the rest of

385
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,640
my

386
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:25,159
talk so uh since 1998 this is

387
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,159
uh uh a list of all of the different

388
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:30,600
species combinations that we've been

389
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:32,679
able to produce over the years uh I've

390
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,879
underlined the species that are

391
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:38,000
triploids so you see a significant

392
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,240
number of those progyny are triploid but

393
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,720
we have the capability to combine uh

394
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,120
multiple species here and and our

395
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,240
long-term strategy is for overall

396
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:53,119
Improvement of diploid

397
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:56,400
species independently of tetraploids to

398
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:59,399
make that final uh F1 hybridization

399
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,600
between the dip diploid and the tetrol

400
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,200
generating triploid

401
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:08,240
progyny uh since I moved to Cornell in

402
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,720
2009 we've produced about 10,000 uh

403
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:16,319
seedling progeny representing our next

404
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:19,319
round of potential uh cultivars for

405
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:22,439
selection so up till now we've largely

406
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:24,839
been relying on phenotypic selection and

407
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,480
the other uh Willow breeding

408
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,678
programs uh the main ones being in

409
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,159
England and in Sweden Sweden as well

410
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,840
have been relying on phenotypic

411
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:36,320
selection and this is our overall scheme

412
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,839
that we've been using first to do those

413
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,480
control pollinations in the

414
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:44,759
greenhouse uh producing seed that we

415
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,079
immediately sew uh and get started in

416
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:49,319
the

417
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:51,480
greenhouse uh in Midsummer we transplant

418
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:53,678
those out to the field so here we're

419
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,798
talking about thousands of

420
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,640
progyny uh outplanted to the field here

421
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,400
as you see we're doing uh in our Nursery

422
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,038
beds here in

423
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:08,640
Geneva and then typically we would

424
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:11,200
evaluate seedlings within uh family rows

425
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,000
in those Nursery beds and make a

426
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,798
selection on the order of 10 to

427
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,400
15% uh within the best families and then

428
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:23,639
propagate those to replicated selection

429
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,798
trials and these have only been on

430
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,480
single

431
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:30,759
sites uh and here we're talking about on

432
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,120
the order of 60 to 80 genotypes that are

433
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:36,240
Advanced into these selection

434
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:38,719
trials finally from analysis of those

435
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,919
selection trials we select on the order

436
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,200
of 12 to 15 genotypes to advance into

437
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,640
Regional yield trials where it's

438
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,798
critical to evaluate genotype by

439
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,159
environment

440
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:52,639
interactions uh to look at uh their

441
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,960
response to varying Pest and disease

442
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,799
pressure on different sites their

443
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,798
response to different soil types and

444
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:04,200
climate conditions uh so overall that

445
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:07,240
phenotypic selection process uh takes us

446
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:14,159
to Regional yield trials within four to

447
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:17,319
seven years and our overall cycle of uh

448
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,880
identifying new cultivars runs on a

449
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:20,879
cycle of about 10 to 12

450
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:28,919
years so we uh went through that process

451
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,000
again using uh genotypes that rich cop

452
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:34,880
bred in

453
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,640
uh uh 1998

454
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,679
1999 uh got those into yield trials that

455
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:45,960
were planted from 2005 up through uh

456
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:49,080
2008 across New York State and through

457
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:52,360
collaboration uh across many parts of

458
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:58,038
North America all the way from uh

459
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:59,639
Montreal Quebec out to uh Wasa Minnesota

460
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:02,519
just south of

461
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,480
Minneapolis uh even in the Upper

462
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:07,599
Peninsula of Michigan so those are our

463
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,079
Target regions the

464
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,719
Northeast uh and Upper Midwest and

465
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,278
Southern parts of

466
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,319
Canada and you can see when we look at

467
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:20,079
the yield of the top five genotypes in

468
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:22,278
each of these trials and compare them

469
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:25,319
with the foundation breeding material

470
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:27,640
that we had in Syracuse originally and

471
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,558
yield trials that were managed by my

472
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,919
colleagues Tim vul and Larry

473
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:34,720
abrahamson those new cultivars from uh

474
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:38,840
first round of

475
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,679
breeding uh produced about a 30 to 35%

476
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:46,319
increase in yield

477
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,720
overall so uh that's our success in one

478
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,519
round of breeding through capturing

479
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,000
heterosis of species

480
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,158
hybrids among those cultivars that we

481
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,240
tested in those yield trials we have now

482
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,520
patented eight of them and uh those are

483
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,720
licensed uh by the Research Foundation

484
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:07,038
of Sunni to a very active and

485
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,120
collaborative uh Nursery producer many

486
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,400
of you uh know uh through his primary

487
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:15,759
business which is producing uh wine

488
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,919
grape cuting uh Dennis rack at doua

489
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:22,240
Willow so he now is the main source of

490
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,679
planting stock for commercial growers in

491
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,240
North America uh with production

492
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:30,919
capacity of about 30 million cuting per

493
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:33,359
year that's enough uh for 5 to 6,000

494
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:36,440
Acres of Willow each

495
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,399
year I just want to highlight again that

496
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,120
uh many of these cultivars are hybrids

497
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:46,640
between the diploid cix viminalis and

498
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:51,158
tetrol cix Mayana or between the diploid

499
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,159
cix peria and tetrol salx

500
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:57,720
Mayana

501
00:23:53,798 --> 00:24:00,519
okay uh we have now continued to advance

502
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,159
our breeding program program and our

503
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:07,278
next round of genetic selection trials

504
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:10,039
was planted here in Geneva in 2008 again

505
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:12,960
with 75 genotypes we harvested that the

506
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:17,359
first time in

507
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:22,759
2011 and from those genotypes bred in

508
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:25,798
2002 and 2005 um and some in 2001 again

509
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:28,798
we have captured about a 15% increase in

510
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:33,639
yield compared to our current commercial

511
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:36,480
alvars so these are now uh have now been

512
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,480
Advanced to Regional yield trials to do

513
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,558
that same type of genotype by

514
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:45,399
environment interaction testing uh but

515
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:48,000
now we're getting into the yields of 17

516
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:49,759
dry metric tons per hectare per year

517
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,119
that are really going to have an impact

518
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,119
on the economics of the

519
00:24:53,798 --> 00:25:01,519
system so I am uh very fortunate to be a

520
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:04,360
member of uh USDA funded project uh to

521
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,639
develop Willow and switchgrass as

522
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:09,240
bioenergy crops in the Northeast us it's

523
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,200
led by Penn State uh and our

524
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,519
contribution to this project which we

525
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,960
call new bio was to establish a new

526
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:21,480
round of uh Regional yield trials

527
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:25,120
through collaboration with Sunni ESF uh

528
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,720
daa Willow and fonia Folks at Penn State

529
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:30,158
Marvin Hall and John Carlson including a

530
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,319
site on Rec claim M land uh

531
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,960
collaboration with Steve defasio at West

532
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,839
Virginia University and with Ray Miller

533
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,278
up in esim ALA

534
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,918
Michigan so we expect that uh once we

535
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,119
have the results of this new round of

536
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:51,480
yield trial we will advance at least uh

537
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:51,479
a couple new cultivars uh to commercial

538
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:57,798
production now we recognize that our

539
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,398
potential to capture uh those yield

540
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:02,879
improvements

541
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:05,959
is getting smaller and smaller meaning

542
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,000
that we need to be more precise uh in

543
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,720
our selection methods and we have

544
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,679
recently moved to

545
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:21,679
planting uh to not relying so heavily on

546
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:25,440
unreplicated performance in these family

547
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,360
row trials in Nursery beds but rather

548
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,360
propagating all of the genotypes

549
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:34,119
that we produce in a family and testing

550
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,519
them now in replicated

551
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:39,639
trials as you can imagine these are

552
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:42,158
getting very large uh when you pick

553
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,480
almost 300 genotypes or here we have

554
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,000
1100

555
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,480
genotypes uh replicated in four reps I

556
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,640
would love to do this on multiple sites

557
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,360
uh but even on one site uh this is a lot

558
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,919
of plots to go out and measure and

559
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:00,359
evaluate uh but that is what we have

560
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:04,360
done here in

561
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:07,759
2013 uh Fred Galer is my PhD student is

562
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:10,359
managing this trial and Craig Carlson uh

563
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:13,599
my third PhD student is managing this

564
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:13,599
trial both here in

565
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:20,440
Geneva okay so to summarize uh our

566
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:22,959
current strategy for breeding seix

567
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,278
hybrids uh is to capture heterosis

568
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,000
through species hybridization uh

569
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:31,558
especially to produce triploids

570
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,640
uh that our initial selections uh

571
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:36,879
produce some impressive yield gains but

572
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,360
uh in order to maintain those we will

573
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,240
need to get more precise and produce

574
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,678
larger families with better overall

575
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,079
Precision of

576
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,360
selection uh which we think we can gain

577
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:53,599
and also gain uh advantages of early

578
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:57,079
selection by developing genomic tools

579
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,079
and developing marker assisted

580
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,719
selection so really what we're talking

581
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:04,480
about is whether we can pick a needle

582
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,079
from a hay stack right whether we can

583
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,079
pick those particular genotypes out of

584
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:12,038
thousands that we can produce through

585
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:17,398
breeding uh that have all of the

586
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:19,879
traits uh and additive uh genes combined

587
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:22,798
in that one single Superior

588
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,080
genotype uh so I wish I could just look

589
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,359
at the pots on the greenhouse bench and

590
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,720
pick out that one needle out of the

591
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,959
hyack of

592
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,000
seedlings uh but again we can't do that

593
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,399
by eye we need to develop genomic tools

594
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,240
uh that can do that for

595
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:42,839
us so we are very fortunate uh to

596
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,240
collaborate with Folks At

597
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:49,720
Doe uh especially Jerry tuskin at oakd

598
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,558
National Lab uh and his uh relying on

599
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,798
his connections with the joint genome

600
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:59,480
Institute of doe uh who have invested

601
00:28:55,798 --> 00:29:02,038
resources to sequence salx Pera as a

602
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:05,880
reference uh for

603
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:08,000
salx so we selected one of our female

604
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,960
clones again a central clone in our

605
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,079
breeding

606
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:16,360
program uh did entirely alumina

607
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:19,519
sequencing uh that was done at

608
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:22,119
jgi uh the assembly was done by high bow

609
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:26,200
Tang at the Craig Venter Institute in

610
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:28,759
Chris towns lab and we now have uh

611
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:32,000
released that First Assembly

612
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:35,079
uh in phytozome version 10 this is the

613
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,159
doe uh genomics

614
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:42,639
website so uh we're up to here if you're

615
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:46,919
uh a genome jockey we're up to uh

616
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,240
scaffolds with an l50 of 190 KB uh but

617
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:53,159
we still have about

618
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,120
9,300 scaffolds in our assembly so

619
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,600
basically what that means is using this

620
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:00,918
short read alumina technology

621
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:04,319
uh we have assembled The genome but

622
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:07,720
still it's in a large number of small

623
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,759
pieces uh are our ultimate aim is to

624
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,960
assemble all of those sequences into

625
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:14,679
chromosome scale

626
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,798
assemblies uh but that is going to take

627
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,200
some additional sequencing work which we

628
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:22,879
are

629
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,880
undertaking uh as we

630
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:27,960
speak what we have been able to do is to

631
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,839
take advantage of this great Tech

632
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:35,960
technology developed in Ed Buckler's lab

633
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:38,158
uh Ed is in the USDA uh down in itha uh

634
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,960
called genotyping by

635
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:46,440
sequencing this high resolution uh high

636
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:49,600
density marker system uh can be uh

637
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,640
developed without any prior genomic

638
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,119
sequence

639
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,880
knowledge uh it's very cheap per sample

640
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:59,079
so we can get uh thousands of markers

641
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,480
for only 35 per

642
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:06,439
sample and we were very lucky uh to get

643
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,240
in early on as uh Ed and Rob Elshire and

644
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,120
Sharon Mitchell down in nitha were

645
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:16,480
developing this technique uh to uh

646
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:19,839
develop GBS markers for uh seix peria

647
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,960
which has now helped us in developing a

648
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:25,398
genetic map and improving our overall

649
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,399
genome

650
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:35,120
assembly so what we did was to apply GBS

651
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:36,558
to an F2 family Fairly large 495 progyny

652
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,479
of seix

653
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:42,918
peria developed using our reference

654
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,480
genome 9 9406 as the original

655
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:49,639
grandmother uh so that we can develop we

656
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:53,278
uh produced uh in collaboration with

657
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:55,119
Steve defasio and Eli Rogers Melnick at

658
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:58,759
West Virginia University a

659
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:01,439
highresolution genetic map uh this

660
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:05,038
pedigree we could then take those GBS

661
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,519
markers and align them uh to our

662
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:10,038
scaffolds in the

663
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:13,278
assembly and using the powers of the

664
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:16,119
genetic mapping could then assemble our

665
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:19,880
scaffolds into chromosome scale

666
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:22,158
pseudomolecule uh level

667
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:28,360
molecules so we have

668
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:33,120
about uh 75 or 80% of the assembly now

669
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:37,479
uh aligned into these 19 pseudomolecules

670
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:40,398
equivalent to the 19 chromosomes of salx

671
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:43,919
what I'm showing here in this figure is

672
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:45,038
the alignment of the seix map to the

673
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,799
popular

674
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:53,158
genome and uh here is the alignment of

675
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:56,278
the salx uh sequence assembly scaffolds

676
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,278
aligned to the genetic

677
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:02,679
map so some things that we've learned

678
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:04,519
and we continue to uh analyze uh the

679
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:06,720
genome assembly is that there are some

680
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:10,839
major chromosome rearrangements between

681
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:15,200
salx and populace uh big one here is uh

682
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:19,278
between chromosome 1 and 16 there is a a

683
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:22,159
fusion uh between popler and

684
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,679
seix uh a major chunk of popler

685
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:28,360
chromosome 1 is fused with salx

686
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:31,399
chromosome 16 we also see some uh

687
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:35,439
important translocations and I'm I'm

688
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:37,079
going to uh uh tip my hand here and say

689
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,759
that we have been mapping the sex

690
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:43,240
determination Locus and actually that

691
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:46,720
sex determination Locus sits in a region

692
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:50,759
that is translo translocated from

693
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,558
popular chromosome 19 to salx chromosome

694
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:56,960
15 so we're we're learning some

695
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:58,240
important differences between popler and

696
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,480
Willow

697
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,359
uh having the genome assembly here

698
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,319
there's a lot more analysis that uh we

699
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:10,639
will be doing in the in the near

700
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:13,358
future at jgi they also sequen some of

701
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,720
the express genes uh so that we could

702
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:19,440
develop uh a highquality annotation of

703
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:23,199
all of the genes in the in the genome

704
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,599
doing uh RNA seek from uh eight

705
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:28,480
different tissue libraries made from

706
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,320
five different tissues here

707
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,320
uh basically what we see is that there

708
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:36,240
are slightly fewer genes expressed in

709
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,399
salx than there are in popler uh but

710
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:42,678
still we have a pretty good library or

711
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:45,878
or annotation of the uh 38,000 or so

712
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,878
genes expressed in

713
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,358
Willow okay the next step is to use that

714
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:55,320
genetic map those GBS

715
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:58,000
markers uh and the genome sequence to

716
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:01,119
develop uh mapping populations so that

717
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,559
we can relate phenotype to genotype so

718
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,240
that we can start to uh work towards

719
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,480
marker assistant

720
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:10,239
selection and we are using the

721
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,358
complimentary approaches of both qtl

722
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:16,159
mapping using biparental populations

723
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:19,319
with Association mapping using a diverse

724
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:22,679
collection of cix

725
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,400
Heria so we are now going back to that

726
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:27,759
same F2

727
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,119
family uh which has a pretty large

728
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,160
number of

729
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,640
progyny uh and Craig Carlson here has

730
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:37,960
planted that out in a replicated trial

731
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:40,078
here in Geneva so that we can start to

732
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,679
characterize traits of importance for

733
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,560
biomass production for Willow

734
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:50,358
biology and map them into this uh

735
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:52,639
highresolution uh biparental mapping

736
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:55,358
population we've done that on some of

737
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:57,639
the some of the simple traits already

738
00:35:55,358 --> 00:36:01,880
since Willow is dous we have been able

739
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:04,400
to map uh the Locust controlling sex in

740
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:08,200
Willow as I mentioned before it maps to

741
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:12,480
a single spot on chromosome 15 and in

742
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:16,719
fact uh we see that salx peria and

743
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,400
perhaps all salx are using a ZW sex

744
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:23,358
determination system that means that the

745
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:27,200
female is the heter heterotic sex the

746
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:31,279
male is ZZ while at least populous troc

747
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:33,279
carpa uses an XY sex determination

748
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,000
system so again there are some

749
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,680
interesting contrasts there between poer

750
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,920
and

751
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:45,078
cix and in the overall evolution of

752
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:47,800
daishi uh and whether uh that XY and ZW

753
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,599
system can flipflop back and forth or at

754
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,760
what point in the Divergence between

755
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,039
popler and cix uh did it

756
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,599
flip-flop that's just one example of the

757
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:00,318
types of traits that we can map uh using

758
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:03,200
uh this powerful

759
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:06,440
system now Fred Galer has been working

760
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:09,519
to develop Association mapping or genome

761
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:12,720
a genomewide Association study or

762
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:15,199
gwas uh using the collection of salx

763
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:18,399
peria that we have assembled uh from

764
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:21,199
across the Northeast uh so we have uh

765
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,960
it's a relatively small Association

766
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,960
mapping population only 112

767
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:30,639
genotypes uh but we have planted that on

768
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:34,480
replicated trials here in Geneva out at

769
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:36,679
the uh clarel station in Portland and in

770
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,559
collaboration with Steve defasio down in

771
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:41,000
Morgantown West

772
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:43,078
Virginia we have fully genotyped that

773
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,239
collection with

774
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:51,000
GBS and uh for the last two years Fred

775
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:53,358
has been working on uh phenotyping those

776
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,199
populations with some of the key traits

777
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:58,199
again that we're interested in for

778
00:37:55,199 --> 00:38:01,199
biomass production including as you can

779
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:03,639
imagine stem height stem diameters uh

780
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:08,000
stem numbers we're very interested in

781
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:10,480
Wood density we use highresolution

782
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,719
thermogravimetric uh analysis to

783
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,440
determine the composition of cellulose

784
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:19,159
hemicellulose ligant and Ash in the wood

785
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,440
and we've also been able to measure Leaf

786
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:24,838
area uh use a spad meter to measure Leaf

787
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,280
nitrogen and a parameter to measure

788
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:30,078
stodal conductance we've also developed

789
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:34,680
some techniques to look at overall Crown

790
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:36,400
form and and growth uh form also looking

791
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:39,279
at Pest and disease resistance which

792
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,240
aren't on these which which isn't on

793
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,640
this

794
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:45,639
list again some of the initial hits uh

795
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:48,318
that Fred has been able to map and he's

796
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:51,078
actively working on uh mapping all of

797
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:53,079
those traits right now uh again a simple

798
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,880
one is to look at sex

799
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:58,519
determination and the mapping in the

800
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,200
association

801
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:04,119
population matches that that we see in

802
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:08,639
the biparental qtl population pointing

803
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:12,079
to a single uh major Locus on chromosome

804
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,879
15 so that highlights how we can use

805
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,039
these two different mapping populations

806
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,200
to complement one another and to confirm

807
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,358
the hits that we're getting uh in both

808
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:24,279
types of

809
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,799
mapping some other hits that uh Fred has

810
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,280
come up with here we see a significant

811
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,079
hit for

812
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,720
uh variation in stem height so as we

813
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,880
look at these Manhattan plots each of

814
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:38,919
these different colors represents the 19

815
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:44,480
different chromosomes in salx and each

816
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:47,559
dot represents a uh a snip or a marker

817
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,280
on that chromosome uh as it gets higher

818
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:52,838
in this plot represents a higher level

819
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,560
of significance uh for the correlation

820
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:58,440
between variation in that trait and that

821
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:01,838
particular spot on the Gen or

822
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:05,358
snip so looking at uh hits for stem

823
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:08,480
height here uh he has some Snips that

824
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,880
are significant and map uh to this very

825
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,318
specific region of the genome which we

826
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:18,119
can map using uh I think this was done

827
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:21,358
with about 25,000 GBS markers uh mapping

828
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,200
those Snips between a glyco hydrolase

829
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,358
and a

830
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:27,799
cellulose uh which we now need to follow

831
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:30,519
up on and see uh how how they are

832
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,318
involved in regulating stem

833
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:38,280
height another hit for hemicellulose

834
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:41,119
Content Quantified by TGA here we see uh

835
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:44,160
significant Snips here in a sugar

836
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,760
nucleotide epimerase uh potentially

837
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,399
involved again in Sugar nucleotide

838
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,440
conversions during cell wall

839
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,318
biosynthesis but this gives us some

840
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,200
targets some canidate genes that we can

841
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:59,119
follow up on look at their patterns of

842
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:02,799
expression look at uh the variation in

843
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:06,039
alals in our association population uh

844
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:10,119
and to see how uh those different alals

845
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:13,719
uh are influencing uh the traits

846
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:15,880
involved okay so to summarize we have a

847
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:19,279
pretty good genome

848
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:21,838
assembly uh in place right now uh

849
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,880
produced through a good collaboration

850
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:29,119
with the joint genome Institute of doe

851
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:32,000
we continue to advance uh those genomic

852
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,519
resources we have developed both qtl and

853
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,280
Association mapping populations that can

854
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:40,679
complement each other uh the big issue

855
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,519
the big uh the most expensive part now

856
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:44,838
is phenotyping those

857
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:47,000
populations uh with thousands of plots

858
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:48,519
out in the field but we have great

859
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,639
potential for

860
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:52,639
identifying uh good candidates for

861
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:55,519
marker assisted

862
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:58,559
selection now the final part of my talk

863
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:01,039
is that I think that seix also

864
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,318
represents a unique system for the study

865
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,519
of

866
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:07,480
heterosis uh and that having these

867
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:10,880
genomic resources gives us uh the

868
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:14,280
potential to uh probe some of the

869
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,400
genomic basis for heterosis in this

870
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,119
highly

871
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:21,200
heterozygous uh species which has

872
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:27,720
undergone no domestication up up to this

873
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:29,919
point and also uh displays heterosis in

874
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:32,199
uh across Ploy

875
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,240
levels or in

876
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:38,480
triploids okay so I'm going to take you

877
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:41,639
back to this 2008 selection trial uh

878
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,760
which has 75 genotypes and if we look at

879
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:48,159
the yield the mean yield of those 75

880
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:52,599
genotypes in that trial and look at the

881
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:55,118
pyy uh the vast majority of the upper

882
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:57,960
50th percentile of genotypes in that

883
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,079
trial were triploid

884
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,480
and the overall yield of the triploids

885
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,000
was significantly and dramatically

886
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,159
greater than the yield of the diploids

887
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
in that

888
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:11,480
trial uh the yield of the tetrols is not

889
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,280
significantly different uh but when we

890
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,480
look at some of the other traits like

891
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,680
stem number or uh aspects of biomass

892
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,440
composition we do see significant

893
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,358
differences between the triploids and

894
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,240
the

895
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:29,519
tetrols the bottom line here again is

896
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:31,679
that uh we are seeing uh

897
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:35,079
dramatically better performance in

898
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:38,000
triploids compared to

899
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:41,039
diploids so we want to ask uh what is

900
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,760
the genomic basis for that heterosis

901
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:46,838
that we're capturing so just to uh sort

902
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,920
of Define uh what we mean by heterosis

903
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:52,639
the classic example is in maiz where if

904
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,280
you cross uh one inbred line with

905
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:59,000
another inbred line you see that the

906
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,160
progyny display either midparent

907
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,559
heterosis meaning that their mean

908
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:07,358
performance is better than the average

909
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:10,359
performance of the two parents or you

910
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:12,880
may see better parent heterosis meaning

911
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:16,719
that the progyny are better than even

912
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:21,200
the best uh the better of the two

913
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:23,879
parents right uh and there are some

914
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,439
classic uh models to

915
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,599
explain uh how that heterosis is

916
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,880
occurring

917
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,000
whether it's occurring through a

918
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,680
dominance

919
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,318
model uh or through an overdominance

920
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:39,558
model uh the dominance model meaning

921
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:42,079
that uh there are complementary additive

922
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:44,440
alals which come together in the hybrid

923
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:50,280
to make that hybrid even better than its

924
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:54,039
parents or uh in the in the other model

925
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:57,559
uh the overdominance model where the

926
00:44:54,039 --> 00:45:01,039
presence of a uh

927
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:03,760
heterozygote even at a single Gene can

928
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:06,759
confer Superior performance to that

929
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,800
hybrid over its two parents the main

930
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,800
difference being that in the ma example

931
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:16,119
those are inbreds highly homozygous

932
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,440
inbred lines that have been breed for

933
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:23,559
decades here we're seeing heterosis when

934
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,480
we cross two wild

935
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:27,400
accessions uh that are highly

936
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,800
heterozygous

937
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:33,480
and when we cross a diploid with a

938
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:35,920
tetrol to get a triploid

939
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,599
right so the approach that we're taking

940
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,960
is to look at the patterns of gene

941
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,519
expression in the triploid progyny and

942
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,760
to what extent is the inheritance of

943
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:49,280
gene expression in the hybrid progyny

944
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,880
non-additive meaning different from the

945
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,040
midparent

946
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,358
average can we identify a Le specific

947
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:58,199
expression inherited from one or the

948
00:45:56,358 --> 00:45:59,719
other parent

949
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:02,159
and the obvious question would be is

950
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:04,679
there a dosage effect uh in those

951
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,960
triploid progyny that are getting two

952
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:08,639
copies from the tetrol parent and one

953
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,559
copy from the diploid

954
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:14,000
parent

955
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:15,880
finally uh are those differentially

956
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,440
expressed genes responsible for

957
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:21,280
heterosis so can we correlate the

958
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:25,480
patterns of gene expression that we see

959
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:27,800
with uh phenotype in the field or in the

960
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,599
greenhouse

961
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,440
so as we look at quantifying patterns of

962
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:36,240
gene expression uh this is a scheme that

963
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,440
we use uh first of all sort of the

964
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:42,879
default is when uh gene expression

965
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:47,039
equals in I'm sorry in parent

966
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,599
one uh is equivalent to that in parent

967
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:52,000
two here parent one will always be the

968
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,240
maternal parent so when there's no

969
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,119
differential expression and the progyny

970
00:46:55,239 --> 00:47:00,279
gene expression is at that same level we

971
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:03,599
classify that as

972
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,599
additive that's not so interesting to us

973
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,240
the more interesting case is when there

974
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,480
is differential gene expression between

975
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,959
the two parents here the mother has

976
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,400
higher expression than the father here

977
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,960
the mother has lower expression than the

978
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:22,639
father if the progyny expression hits

979
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,199
the midpoint between the parental levels

980
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:28,558
of expression again we would call that

981
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:31,118
additive if the progen any expression is

982
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,920
equivalent to the high parent or the low

983
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,599
parent then that's an example of

984
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,880
dominance or if it is below the low

985
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:41,559
parent or above the high parent again

986
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,640
that is a non-additive pattern of

987
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:46,599
expression an example of underdominance

988
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:49,199
or

989
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:51,680
overdominance so in the cases where we

990
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:54,199
see differential expression between our

991
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:56,639
two parents we will classify the

992
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:59,159
expression in the progyny according to

993
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:01,039
the these five

994
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:04,078
categories

995
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:07,519
okay in order to to

996
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,280
test uh to look at uh differential

997
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:10,480
patterns of expression we've developed

998
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,359
these eight

999
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:17,358
families uh first of all an F1 family of

1000
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:20,480
cix peria that same F2 family of salx

1001
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:24,039
peria that I've talked about and then

1002
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:27,519
reciprocal crosses between peria and

1003
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:29,000
viminalis here peria as the mother or

1004
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:32,960
Vialis as the

1005
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,358
mother and then triploid families

1006
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:39,639
representing crosses between peria

1007
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:44,119
Mayana or between viminalis in

1008
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:46,118
Mayana and we have planted uh uh

1009
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:49,920
typically a 100 progeny from each of

1010
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:51,640
these families in the field and uh the

1011
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,440
experiment that I'm going to describe to

1012
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:57,838
you was done by selecting 10 random

1013
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,798
progyny from uh six of these eight

1014
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:02,159
families uh growing those in the

1015
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:03,920
greenhouse and then we extracted RNA to

1016
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,519
use for RNA

1017
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,200
seek

1018
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:11,119
okay uh we extracted tissue from uh

1019
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:13,879
extracted RNA from two different tissues

1020
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:18,280
either from Cho tips or from stem

1021
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:22,838
internodes and uh map those reads back

1022
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:24,880
to our uh genome assembly did statistics

1023
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:28,039
to look for differential patterns of

1024
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,680
expression and we will will continue on

1025
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:32,159
unfortunately I don't have time to talk

1026
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:34,078
about this today but uh use some

1027
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,960
additional techniques to look at a

1028
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,440
specific

1029
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:41,559
expression okay just to quickly go

1030
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,920
through uh some of the main conclusions

1031
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:47,079
the first one being that triploids

1032
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,519
Express more genes than

1033
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:51,798
diploids so when we look at the total

1034
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:53,280
counts of genes that are expressed in

1035
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:56,239
the triploid

1036
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,839
progyny uh we see that there are

1037
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:01,078
thousands of

1038
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:04,039
genes uh Express thousands of additional

1039
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:04,680
genes expressed in the triploids than in

1040
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:07,798
the

1041
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:10,679
diploids so that may be one clue right

1042
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:13,599
there interestingly the overall levels

1043
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:16,639
of expression tend to be lower in the

1044
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:20,798
progyny than they are in the

1045
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:22,920
parents now when we cluster the patterns

1046
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:27,239
of gene

1047
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:31,559
expression uh between progyny and and

1048
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:34,519
the midparent values here the first

1049
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:37,798
level of clustering that we

1050
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:41,039
see is distinguishing

1051
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:44,679
progyny from those midparent

1052
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:46,279
values so the greatest level of

1053
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:50,000
difference in

1054
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:53,440
expression is between progyny and

1055
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,079
parents the next level of CR clustering

1056
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,559
is at the level of

1057
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:00,599
tissue and Fin finally sort of the

1058
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,680
bottom level of clustering is at the

1059
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:05,920
level of

1060
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:09,318
species so it's interesting that uh the

1061
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,559
greatest difference in the gene

1062
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:14,719
expression patterns that we're seeing

1063
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:17,319
are differences between progyny and

1064
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:19,719
parents even greater than differences

1065
00:51:17,318 --> 00:51:19,719
between

1066
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:25,759
species to put that another way uh we

1067
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:27,879
see greater differential gene expression

1068
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,359
between the mid parent and the progyny

1069
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:33,119
then we see between the two

1070
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:37,239
parents uh which are different species

1071
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:40,760
right so here when we compare uh one

1072
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:43,719
parent to another male to female you see

1073
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:46,160
that most of the dots are fairly close

1074
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:49,078
to the one to one line but when we

1075
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:51,639
compare progyny to M parent now we have

1076
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:54,760
a much broader sorry much broader

1077
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:56,679
scattering of uh spots representing

1078
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:59,640
greater differential gene expression

1079
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:01,879
between progyny and

1080
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:06,440
parent okay the next thing was to

1081
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:08,680
quantify among those genes which are uh

1082
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:11,639
differentially expressed between the two

1083
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:14,199
parents okay so statistically which

1084
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:17,679
genes for which parent one is not equal

1085
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:20,838
to parent two and as you can see here

1086
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:25,199
the triploids and the interspecific

1087
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:27,639
diploids have far more genes showing uh

1088
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:31,919
differential expression between the two

1089
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:35,960
parents than our seix peria

1090
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:38,720
families so of about 35,000 genes here

1091
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:42,039
as many as 7,000 genes are

1092
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:45,318
differentially expressed between the two

1093
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:48,358
parents okay so now for those

1094
00:52:45,318 --> 00:52:49,838
differentially expressed genes and and

1095
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:50,798
they're more in the Cho tip than there

1096
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:52,920
are in the

1097
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:55,079
internode for those differentially

1098
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,440
expressed genes we fit them into those

1099
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:02,359
five categories

1100
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:05,639
are they maternally dominant paternally

1101
00:53:02,358 --> 00:53:08,798
dominant overdominant or underdominant

1102
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:11,318
or are they in that sort of default

1103
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:14,000
additive case where they hit the

1104
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:16,759
midparent mean and the interesting thing

1105
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,838
here is that those genes that show

1106
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:23,839
additive expression are very very

1107
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:26,679
few in fact the vast majority are

1108
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:28,480
showing highly maternal dominant

1109
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:31,199
patterns of

1110
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:34,079
expression so again that may be a clue

1111
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:38,279
to uh the heterosis that we're seeing in

1112
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:41,880
species hybrids in salx we see more in

1113
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:44,680
choot tip than we do in

1114
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:47,880
internode finally uh what we want to go

1115
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:50,879
on to look at is uh can we actually look

1116
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:53,720
at the AL coming from the mother and the

1117
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,440
expression of the mother's alil compared

1118
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:59,118
to the father's alil we needed to ident

1119
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,440
identify Snips or sequence differences

1120
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:04,240
between uh those two parents so we have

1121
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,519
now resequenced all of our parents in

1122
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:11,039
this experiment and you see we see quite

1123
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:14,798
a few differences Snips that we can rely

1124
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:18,239
on uh to give us as many as

1125
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:21,440
18,000 uh Snips uh so we can start to

1126
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:24,439
sort out uh a Le specific patterns of

1127
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:27,838
expression between mother and

1128
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:31,200
father okay so so to summarize this

1129
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:33,159
final uh experiment that I described

1130
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:34,719
there is greater differential gene

1131
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:38,798
expression in

1132
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:42,279
triploids uh than in our our salx peria

1133
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:44,960
diploids that the gene expression levels

1134
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,599
in the progyny show a strong pattern of

1135
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,000
maternal parent dominance which is very

1136
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:53,720
interesting The Next Step that we need

1137
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,838
to move on to is to start to phenotype

1138
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:58,078
individuals in the field and in the

1139
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,719
greenhouse

1140
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,680
uh and correlate the patterns of gene

1141
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:05,239
expression and perhaps expression of

1142
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:08,440
individual genes that are differentially

1143
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:10,479
expressed with the heterotic phenotypes

1144
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,880
that we can quantify in the greenhouse

1145
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,880
or in the

1146
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:19,119
field so uh that's all I have time to

1147
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:23,199
talk about today I want

1148
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:24,838
to uh express my sincere thanks for all

1149

1150
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:31,279

1153
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:40,400
my graduate student and and then postto

1154
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,160

1155
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:46,119
to develop our methods of analysis of

1156
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:48,598
wood composition and my collaborators

the crews that we've had here working

1163
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:06,920
with us in the summer primarily here in

1164
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:09,679
Geneva so I will stop there thank you

1165
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,639
for your attention and I'd be happy to

1166
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:14,519
answer any questions including those

1167
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:16,879
from itha if you unmute your microphone

1168
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:16,880
so

1169
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:24,960
[Applause]

1170
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,039
thanks jaro quick question do you think

1171
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,119
the uh uh

1172
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:31,480
cor the differential expression that you

1173
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:35,400
see in the

1174
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:37,798
mother genome is is related to uh the

1175
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:40,720
connection with the plased uh plased

1176
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:43,239
genomes uh that are inherited and

1177
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:45,480
therefore foro syesis and everything

1178
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:49,679
else all the other Machinery you think

1179
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:52,519
that is reasonable that they communicate

1180
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:55,838
better uh because they they' evolve

1181
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:57,838
together yeah so just to uh repeat Jar's

1182
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:59,920
question the question is whether the

1183
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:02,318
strong maternal dominance of expression

1184
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,280
that we're seeing may be due to the

1185
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:06,358
influence of the chloroplast genome

1186
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,319
which is inherited from the mother I

1187
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:10,679
think that's an excellent hypothesis

1188
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:13,079
that we can test and and Craig I know is

1189
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:15,078
very interested in testing that

1190
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:17,920
hypothesis and has looked at the

1191
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:21,119
expression of chloroplast genes also in

1192
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:23,798
our RNA SE data the other question is

1193
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:26,680
whether there is some epigenetic

1194
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:29,239
imprinting involved in uh

1195
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:31,279
this maternal dominant expression and

1196
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:33,798
the maternal dominance let me

1197
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:37,160
reemphasize does not matter which

1198
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:40,000
species right so whether salx viminalis

1199
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:42,239
is the mother or cix Pera is the mother

1200
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,838
it is maternal dominant it is not

1201
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:44,838
species

1202
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:51,239
specific

1203
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:53,318
Larry you know in some species like

1204
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:55,639
potato when you make a cross between the

1205
00:57:53,318 --> 00:57:59,798
Teto and the diploid you get a pretty

1206
00:57:55,639 --> 00:58:03,598
high frequen of tets due to um unreduced

1207
00:57:59,798 --> 00:58:05,280
or diploid gamins so I'm wondering um I

1208
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,838
hope your your triploids what you've

1209
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:11,359
done to confirm that they're triploids

1210
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:14,558
and I'm wondering whether diploid gamuts

1211
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:14,558
occur among cellic

1212
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:19,559
species uh yeah so Bruce's question is

1213
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:22,199
how how detailed have we gotten to

1214
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:23,960
confirm that their triploids uh at this

1215
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:27,798
point we've only done flow citometry

1216
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:31,079
we''ve done repeated flow citometry uh

1217
00:58:27,798 --> 00:58:33,480
because that technique can be a little

1218
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:36,920
inconsistent from run to

1219
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:39,639
run uh we have not ruled out that there

1220
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:44,559
could be different levels of

1221
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:47,798
anlo uh I think we could go back and uh

1222
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:49,039
look specifically through our GBS data

1223
00:58:47,798 --> 00:58:52,920
to look

1224
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:56,640
for uh GBS markers that might indicate

1225
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:58,159
anupy of a particular chromosome

1226
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:02,199
uh

1227
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:04,679
so uh yes we do see unreduced gametes

1228
00:59:02,199 --> 00:59:07,439
and salic because sometimes we are able

1229
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:10,118
to get progyny from our

1230
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,519
triploids so that's probably the best

1231
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:17,680
evidence that I can give you

1232
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:21,159
that there is some shaky control of

1233
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,159
chromosome number in G

1234
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:30,760
production uh uh no you sure that

1235
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:33,798
there's some native poly uh Teto and

1236
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:38,799
hexaploid I just wondering are those Alo

1237
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:41,400
or or this Auto polypoid and uh if it's

1238
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:43,838
Auto again that will be question related

1239
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:47,599
to what Bruce just mentioned earlier the

1240
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:50,078
gam and reduction you know uh how uh

1241
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:53,519
that may complicate the the breeding

1242
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:55,720
system yeah I I don't know how detailed

1243
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:58,199
anyone has characterized so the question

1244
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:59,558
is whether they the polyploids are Alo

1245
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:02,759
or

1246
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:04,798
Auto I'm not aware whether anyone has

1247
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:09,079
done any detailed descriptions of those

1248
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:09,079
but I would assume that they are Auto

1249
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:17,480
polys Thomas and then maybe we should go

1250
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:19,920
to IA okay so I'll ask the production so

1251
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,960
you said that having several genotypes

1252
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:25,760
in a field is is superior to a single

1253
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,880
one um but it strikes me if you say your

1254
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,319
had three genotypes in a field and one

1255
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,318
of them got wiped out now you're in a

1256
01:00:29,318 --> 01:00:33,199
field with only 2third of a crop which

1257
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:35,199
can't possibly be economical isn't it

1258
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:37,000
better to just wipe out the whole thing

1259
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:40,960
and start over if you

1260
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,400
get a one of your genot types with a

1261
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,280
fatal

1262
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:48,760
flaw okay

1263
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:51,079
so so if you have picked the one best

1264
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,640
yielding cultivar and have planted all

1265
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:57,079
of your Fields with that one and it gets

1266
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:59,480
wiped out then you have no Yi right if

1267
01:00:57,079 --> 01:01:01,920
you have planted three and you planted

1268
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:04,798
them in blocks or maybe this field in

1269
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:07,000
one this field in another then yet your

1270
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:09,559
one field is wiped out you can replant

1271
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:13,280
it or that one block is wiped out you

1272
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:16,798
can replant it uh the standard in

1273
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:20,319
Ireland now and and in England I think

1274
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:24,519
is to plant in random mixtures and over

1275
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:28,759
time the superior genotypes went out the

1276
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:32,920
rust susceptible genotypes diminish and

1277
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:36,440
you end up with a lower number of plants

1278
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:40,079
per acre but what we found is that that

1279
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:43,480
does not severely in overall how much

1280
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:50,920
percent plant loss can you handle have

1281
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:55,000
comp uh I think you can go down probably

1282
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:57,838
30% in Stand density and still realize

1283
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,838
comparable

1284
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:02,519
any questions from

1285
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,480
itha uh yes you

1286
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:13,239
indicated that there are going to be

1287
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:16,240
seven Harvest commercially so the first

1288
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:18,199
question is is any fertilizer put on

1289
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:20,078
that at all because you're removing a

1290
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:23,480
lot of nutrients from the

1291
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:27,119
soil and as a coroller of that it would

1292
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:30,798
seem to me that over the long term the

1293
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:33,960
plant's ability to take up nutrients

1294
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:36,719
would be a considerable factor in the

1295
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,480
total yield but you never mentioned that

1296
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:40,439
at least I don't think so so I'd like to

1297
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,240
know whether there's any plans to look

1298
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:45,400
at your uh preny for the ability to take

1299
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:48,000
up

1300
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:50,358
nutrients yeah thank you Peter that's an

1301
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,838
excellent question and it's one of the

1302
01:02:50,358 --> 01:02:55,558
aspects of our research that I had to

1303
01:02:52,838 --> 01:02:59,440
drop out from this seminar but is the

1304
01:02:55,559 --> 01:03:03,920
main topic of Eric Fabio's

1305
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:06,400
research uh so he has done uh fertilizer

1306
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,880
trials using some of our current

1307
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,599
commercial cultivars in the

1308
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,880
greenhouse uh has been looking at the

1309
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:16,400
impact of

1310
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:21,278
nutrients uh nutrient management by

1311
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:26,240
cover crops on uh early establishment of

1312
01:03:21,278 --> 01:03:30,199
willows in the field and again has been

1313
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:33,798
analyzing yields from across now 24

1314
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:39,960
different trials to correlate uh soil

1315
01:03:33,798 --> 01:03:42,880
nutrient levels with uh yield and growth

1316
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:45,798
parameters there are conflicting data in

1317
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,838
the literature some papers which say uh

1318
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:51,759
there's very little influence of

1319
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:54,119
fertilizer I believe that uh there is an

1320
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,480
influence of fertilizer especially in

1321
01:03:54,119 --> 01:04:00,480
the early Harvest

1322
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:04,880
Cycles but that it seems fairly likely

1323
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:06,798
that after a certain amount of time uh a

1324
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:09,400
a cycling of nutrients will be

1325
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:12,679
established in Willow plantations so

1326
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:15,278
that long-term fertilizer application

1327
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:15,278
may not be

1328
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:24,239
necessary any other okay I think that's

1329
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:28,839
all the questions we have here okay uh

1330
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:31,278
thank you one more Willows Mich RIS uh

1331
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:34,440
so uh Jay is asking if Willows are

1332
01:04:31,278 --> 01:04:37,358
Michael risal and yes they are and uh

1333
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:40,760
they're rather promiscuous they can form

1334
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:44,078
associations with uh multiple different

1335
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:47,880
tax of mizing that's a very interesting

1336
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:49,599
question and again ties in with the need

1337
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,680
for

1338
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:56,359
fertilizer uh but it's one that needs a

1339
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:56,358
lot more attention

1340
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:06,559
okay one more what type of uh marker you

1341
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:08,679
are using for F2 population like whether

1342
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,000
you are using all kind of marker like

1343
01:05:08,679 --> 01:05:14,078
inter

1344
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:16,960
cross cross and home have yeah so we

1345
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:19,720
have used both pseudo test

1346
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,720
cross uh male parent back cross markers

1347
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:23,598
and female parent back cross markers as

1348
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:27,639
well as intercross

1349
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:31,400
markers uh I think in initial analysis

1350
01:05:27,639 --> 01:05:34,679
we had about 8,300 markers and I think

1351
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:37,599
about 3,300 of them were intercross

1352
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:42,759
markers and something like

1353
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:45,039
202,000 or 2200 were were pseudo test

1354
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:49,520
crossers

1355
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:49,520
yeah okay thanks very

1356
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:56,278
much this has been a production of

1357
01:05:54,519 --> 01:06:00,440
Cornell University
