00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,320

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,320
university

3
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,640
good afternoon everyone and it really is

a pleasure to see you here this

5
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,639
afternoon i have some formal remarks but

6
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,479
i've decided that it's too beautiful a

7
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,598
day to stick to a script so i hope

8
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,280
you're okay with my taking some

9
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,518
a little bit of freedom here to talk

10
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,439
about this wonderful project that we're

11
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,000
about to see unfurl uh this afternoon

12
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,039
and the importance of the concept of

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,598
being rooted and and and how important

14
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,519
that concept is not only to our faculty

15
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,839
and our staff but certainly to our

16
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,280
students that they feel that they have a

17
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,000
home here

18
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,400
at cornell and that they feel that all

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,280
that has led them to come to be here at

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,599
cornell is part of being rooted rooted

21
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,239
in who they are and who they're going to

22
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,878
be and that cornell plays an important

23
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,840
role in that process of becoming who you

24
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,719
are and who you are going to be i just

25
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:18,759
would like to thank justin conrad whose

26
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,759
wonderful genius it was to to create uh

27
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,840
who have contributed to the the

28
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,840
unfurling of this beautiful exhibit here

29
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,120
today and now i'd like to turn the

30
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,360
microphone over to marvin fritz chairman

31
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,400
of horticulture to say a few words so

32
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,640

thank you

34
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,679
so here we stand at the intersection of

35
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,158
art and science

36
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,840
a symbolic junction of apprehension and

37
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,598
perseverance

38
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,360
where we display to the world a part of

39
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,359
our collective character that many words

40
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,040
cannot easily express

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,560
but which one word reveals

42
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,679
before we contemplate the planning

43
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,438
before us

44
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,599
let us take a moment to appreciate the

45
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,438
rich fertile soil that we have in this

46
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,919
place

47
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,919
not the literal soil under our feet but

48
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,358
the metaphorical soil that is cornell

49
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,519
university in the surrounding area

50
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,879
soil is composed of minerals organic

51
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,800
matter microorganisms and water

52
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,040
the mineral elements of our metaphorical

53
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,000
soil are the geological features of this

54
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,639
region with its hills lakes gorges and

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,720
waterfalls that surround us

56
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,199
the lush vegetation and the bountiful

57
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,280
fruit vegetables dairy and wildlife that

58
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,840
we find here comprise the organic matter

59
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,079
the soil's moisture represents a sweat

60
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,879
of our forbearers who risk life and

61
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,039
limbs

62
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,120
sustain themselves in this place

63
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,600
and build an institution that is the

64
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,759
envy of the world

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,000
no living soil is complete without its

66
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,000
biological component

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,240
our living cornell soil contains

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,038
thousands of faculty and staff who care

69
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,840
deeply about the success of students and

70
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,599
work hard to make this place

71
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:14,000
special there is no better soil than

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,320
sustainable community anywhere else in

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,478
the world

74
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,120
it is into this soil that we invite each

75
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,279
of you to establish your roots

76
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,918
sink them deeply into the medium that is

77
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,918
provided to you for the taking

78
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,639
drink the moisture that is contained in

79
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,560
the soil suck up the nutrients and grow

80
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,478
and develop into a beautiful flower that

81
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,720
brightens the world and brings joy and

82
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,399
pleasure to others

83
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,960
like these flowers

84
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,198
each of us have different colors

85
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,599
black white brown

86
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,919
christian jewish muslim buddhists

87
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,199
gay and straight young and old rich and

88
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,599
poor

89
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,199
and just as this display will be all the

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,639
more beautiful from its diversity of

91
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,199
colors and shapes

92
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,280
so to this place will be richer from

93
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,400
those of us who dare seek our roots into

94
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,000
a soil that we call cornell

95
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,159
as we move through the coming weeks of

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,959
exams

97
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,880
and possibly graduation

98
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,038
look upon rooted with the knowledge that

99
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,079
whatever comes our way we will not

100
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:20,879
simply cope but we will blossom

101
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,879
we are strong we are rooted we are

102
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,279

fall

108
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,038
we're thinking about something that we

109
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,960
could do that would involve the whole

110
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:45,918
campus community

111
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,599

130
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,960
you're not aware of it there are solar

131
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,038
lights woven through the insulation so

132
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,680
that you'll be able to enjoy it at night

133

and in the day it'll be colors of pale

134
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,439
white and yellow and at night it'll be

135
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,279
red and white

136
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,120
just a few people to thank from the

137
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,198
beginning we've had so many people

138

involved with this bill miller provided

139
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,240
bulb expertise we had people that range

140
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,560
from the lgbtq community to the

141
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,960
department of horticulture planting the

142
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,879
13 000 bulbs um justin was the the one

143
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,198
who was the creative influence who got

144
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,039
so excited and started talking about the

145
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,639
clock tower and i really didn't believe

146
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,639
that that could happen i feel like it's

147
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,879
sacred turf i can't believe they let us

148
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,120
do this and we're really grateful we had

149
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,200
the grounds department and gannett

150
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
health services involved

151
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,599
um i always want to make sure that we

152
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,640
thank the people who

153
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,440
capture this forever craig cramer jason

154
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,759
koski are taking images that will allow

155
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,440
us to enjoy this for always and not just

156
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,600
for the two weeks that the installation

157
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,680
will be in place

158
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,920
and lastly i think i've acknowledged

159
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,000
everyone else i really want to say i

160
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,399
mean this seriously this could only

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,240
happen at this university

162
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,320
i think that other places wouldn't

163
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,278
recognize the value of public art as a

164
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,278
means to inspire and inform not just to

165
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,759
be pretty but to have a message and to

166
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,000
carry a message to the world and it's an

167
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,600
important one and we're so grateful that

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,759
our administration

169
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,680
sees this as an important gesture and

170
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,600
not just a pretty one

171
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,239
without their support we certainly

172
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,480
wouldn't have the opportunity to play

173
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,480
and express ourselves in this particular

174
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,080
way it's always tricky when you start

175
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,959
thanking people there's the danger of

176
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,000
leaving someone out i think i am

177
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,518
mentioned everywhere there have been a

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,278
lot of people involved so we thank you

179
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,679
for coming we hope you enjoy it the

180
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,958
grounds crew the grounds department um

181
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,719
the grounds department and the

182
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,958
greenhouse staff

183
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,959
helped us out a lot too so thanks

184
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,199
everybody we hope you enjoy it as it

185
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,719
continues to change over the cup next

186
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,879
couple of weeks

187
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,879
we know that it will burn in that means

188
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,559
that the pots will exclude the light and

189
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,559
when we pull them up in two weeks you'll

190
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,319
still be able to see the pattern and

191
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:06,239
that'll be interesting so thanks for

192
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,240
coming out and we hope you enjoy it

193
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,639
we have our formal ribbon settings

194
