1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,240
University yes so this is a a campaign

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,000
stop for

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,560
me uh trying to get your vote uh to

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,719
renew my joint appointment in plant

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,000
breeding so all of you plant breeding

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:25,518
faculty vote early and often uh because

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,518
when we vote we

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,280
win okay so I'm going to really give uh

10
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,399
two seminars in one

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,480
today uh and they are both chapters from

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,840
George Stack's dissertation uh which he

13
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,799
completed last year uh and also a lot of

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,280
work on the powdery mildew project from

15
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:49,000
Ali kala a PhD student in Chris smarts

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,600
lab and uh yeah I will go ahead and

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,119
recognize my collaborators here because

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,399
many of them some of them are in the

19
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,878
room so stepen Snyder you're going to

20
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,239
see some beautiful sem that he did in

21
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,878
Jos Rose's lab

22
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:07,158
I have collaborated with

23
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:10,359
uh uh Jenny Moore's lab for quite a

24
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,240
while now and uh also we were fortunate

25
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:15,519
to have uh to be able to work with ping

26
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:18,519
Wong in entomology in Geneva you'll see

27
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:21,078
that those data and uh I was on

28
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:23,199
sabatical at Colorado state for a year

29
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:25,639
and got to know John McCay very well and

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,680
he was very generous to share a

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,118
segregating population with us uh that's

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,040
the heart of the second half of my talk

33
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:37,118
and uh we got canab noids from Nick

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,280
jackits at serona Labs a startup company

35
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,280
uh that was based in

36
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,718
Geneva so I'm going to talk about hemp

37
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:52,199
today one of the five crops that uh we

38
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:54,280
breed in the lab uh and hemp is a very

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,399
interesting crop because it has multiple

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,680
Market

41
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,399
classes uh there was a

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,680
1937 Popular Mechanics article that came

43
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,799
out saying that EMP would become a

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,439
billion dooll industry that Henry Ford

45
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,319
built a car entirely made of hemp and

46
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:16,318
that we can make 25,000 products out of

47
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:19,639
hemp and that's probably true uh but not

48
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:22,199
all of those products are viable in the

49
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,159
marketplace or competitive for price in

50
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,359
the

51
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,560
marketplace so hemp is an emerging crop

52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,840
because it was only truly legalized by

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,080
the 2018 Farm Bill

54
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,360
uh prior to that it was considered a

55
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,599
schedule one narcotic like heroin uh we

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,080
initially had to have a DEA registration

57
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,318
to be able to schedule one DEA

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,239
registration just to handle the

59
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:51,280
seeds uh but now it's totally legalized

60
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,439
and if you work on hemp you better like

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,439
roller coasters because it has been a

62
00:02:53,439 --> 00:03:01,318
serious roller coaster through the CBD

63
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:04,359
Market uh so that is our top Market

64
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:07,679
uh uh grown either in controlled

65
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,920
environment settings or in high

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,319
intensity Horticultural settings right

67
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,598
now all of the interest is in fiber and

68
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,839
when we say fiber we really mean either

69
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:21,719
the long strong Bast fibers on the

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,000
outside of the stem or the inner Woody

71
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,598
herd uh those are two different product

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
streams leading to two different

73
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:34,158
markets uh and we are going to see a

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,318
real uptick in Grain because uh the FDA

75
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,079
recently approved the use of hemp seed

76
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:42,119
meal as an animal feed ingredient for

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,040
laying hens uh so that is going to

78
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,200
stimulate the grain market over the

79
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:49,400
coming year and uh actually that this

80
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,280
bottom machine is actually a dual

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,519
purpose Harvester that can combine the

82
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,640
grain from very tall hemp plants while

83
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,680
also harvesting the stems uh for fiber

84
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:04,318
products so it is a diverse crop there

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,120
are cultivars that are bred for each of

86
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:11,158
these different Market classes uh but

87
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,519
still in New York we only have less than

88
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:17,560
200 acres of hemp being grown uh I grew

89
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,239
35 Acres on our farm plots in Geneva

90
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,079
this year and that was about a third of

91
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:25,839
the acreage in New York state so it is a

92
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,959
very early emerging

93
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,918
crowd but I think it has a lot of

94
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,478
potential uh we're waiting for for the

95
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,159
farm bill the new farm bill which

96
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:37,038
hopefully will further relieve some of

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,000
the regulatory burden on Farmers a lot

98
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:40,839
of that is based on

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,720
THC

100
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:46,519
uh THC in many people's eyes is viewed

101
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,560
as a very bad

102
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:52,439
thing uh and so we are one of the goals

103
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,600
in our breeding program is to breed for

104
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:58,399
low or no THC to try to basically

105
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,000
eliminate that risk for Growers no

106
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,239
matter what the regulatory

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,519
landscapers we think there is a market

108
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,439
for uh the protein and grain whether

109
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,879
it's for animal feed or for human food

110
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,199
uh for human food we're looking at uh

111
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:16,360
the functional properties of the seed

112
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,560
storage proteins as well but right now

113
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,360
it's all about fiber mainly for building

114
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,759
materials and uh technical

115
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,199
products uh and in order to separate

116
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,479
that Bast from the herd that is a

117
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,520
process called

118
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,918
decortication and and uh we need to have

119
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,560
varieties that are easy and efficient to

120
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,959
decorticate and separate that long fiber

121
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,038
from the

122
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:44,038
herb uh hemp has been notoriously

123
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:47,800
difficult to establish in direct seated

124
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,959
plantings uh germination is typically

125
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,478
rarely over

126
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:57,399
50% uh and there are very few herbicides

127
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,079
that are registered for hemp so early

128
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:02,560
seedling establishment and early

129
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:06,000
seedling bger is a major trait right now

130
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,680
uh to ensure farmer success and as a

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,079
part of that one of my students here

132
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,079
Luis monserate is particularly

133
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,000
interested in breeding for large seed

134
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:17,719
size and our large seed and cultivars

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,279
seem to help to solve that early

136
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,639
establishment problem and the other

137
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,879
issue we've had is that all of the

138
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:29,639
current H cultivars have been bred in

139
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:32,478
Europe pretty much uh or Canada and are

140
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,918
not well adapted to Southern latitudes

141
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,680
we have been bringing in material from

142
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,598
uh tropical and subtropical China which

143
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,120
will address that

144
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:43,478
issue but all of that material tested

145
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,918
hot

146
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:48,318
so uh so these are our challenges in

147
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:51,439
hemp breeding uh we started from scratch

148
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:55,680
in 2017 so where do we get germ

149
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:58,038
plasm fortunately we have the USDA AR

150
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,120
hemp germ plasm repository in Geneva at

151
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:04,000
Cornel agratech and Zach stansil the

152
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,199
curator there has done a fantastic job

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,680
of very rapidly accumulating a large uh

154
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:14,520
assembly of germ plasm both uh working

155
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,400
with foreign repositories and bringing

156
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:20,719
that material to the US but also working

157
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,839
with folks to collect uh fural hemp from

158
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,280
across North

159
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:27,560
America we've done a lot of work to

160
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,000
better understand the genetics of THC

161
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,000
production I'll talk about some of that

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,680
we've done a lot to develop genetic

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,079
mapping

164
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,918
resources uh I'm not going to talk about

165
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,800
that too much today one of our main

166
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:44,038
focus right now is understanding the

167
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,038
genes involved in flowering time uh and

168
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:48,158
again maybe that's for the next talk

169
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:51,120
what I am going to talk about today is

170
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:53,478
pest and disease

171
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,038
resistance and going to start out with

172
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:59,519
powdery mildew uh so this is a project

173
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:02,598
that we did jointly between my lab and

174
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,519
Chris smarts lab uh powdery mildew is

175
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:07,878
caused by the fungus renom myces

176
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,158
ambrosier uh you can see some beautiful

177
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:17,240
pictures here from Bill Welden and David

178
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:19,038
gor's lab and uh it is a big problem in

179
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,079
controlled environment production of

180
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,318
hemp and

181
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,240
cannabis and in our climate in New York

182
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:30,158
we also see quite a bit of powdery

183
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:33,360
mildew in CBD hemp uh grown in again in

184
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:36,799
this intensive Horticultural

185
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,519
setting so right from the outset in 2017

186
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,799
when we started growing hemp uh we

187
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,360
wanted to better understand the traits

188
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:47,240
of the cultivars I'll say that with air

189
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,680
quotes cultivars that were available so

190
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,159
we were very ProActive at trying to

191
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:55,958
reach out to everyone who had seeds and

192
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:59,719
put those into small plot trials and at

193
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:02,479
that time it was all about CBD

194
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,519
so these are pictures of our 2019 uh

195
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,879
trials with 30

196
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:11,120
cultivars uh one in Geneva one at

197
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:14,480
Bluegrass Lane and these were a lot of

198
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,480
work uh a lot of cannaboid analysis that

199
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,159
Steven did in Joss's

200
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,440
lab

201
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:25,559
uh but you learn things by looking at

202
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,240
all of this uh variety of of germ plasm

203
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:31,479
and one thing that we consistently saw

204
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,120
was uh essentially zero ratings for

205
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,079
powdery mildew disease in this variety

206
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,200
FL

207
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:41,439
58 uh so this is a graph of percent

208
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,600
disease uh from ratings that were done

209
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,680
by Ali Calla from those trials and you

210
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,920
see we were getting uh pretty good

211
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,159
levels of powdery Milo and some

212
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:54,039
cultivars but again

213
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:57,120
consistently this cultivar

214
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:59,679
f58 uh was

215
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,240
resistant so when you look at the

216
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:07,919
resistance mechanisms to for powdery

217
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:10,000
Milo uh we see either R Gene based

218
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,439
resistance and there was a paper

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,839
published in

220
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,079
2021 uh describing the first R Gene from

221
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:21,880
Cannabis sativa they called it

222
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:23,599
pm1 uh we would expect this to be a

223
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,120
dominant and race

224
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,680
specific uh mechanism we don't know

225
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,519
anything about the races of uh howder

226
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:35,078
Milo powdery

227
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:37,440
MW uh so that's still an open

228
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:41,559
book I'm just going to say this has been

229
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,720
an extremely frustrating situation uh

230
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:47,399
because this Gene was discovered in a

231
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,519
high THC variety by a company called

232
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,120
Dewey scientific a spin-off from

233
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,600
Washington State

234
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,159
University uh Mark Lang started that

235
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,120
company together with one of his

236
00:10:55,159 --> 00:11:02,319
students you may know him and they have

237
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:04,240
refused to send that material to us uh

238
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,000
they claim that they've bred it into a

239
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,079
hemp variety so it should be compliant

240
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,879
but even

241
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:15,479
still uh they will not send it to us uh

242
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,439
to look at and to compare with uh the

243
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,920
resistance that we have in our hands

244
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,760
it's been extremely

245
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:23,039
frustrating I'm going to continue

246
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:26,639
calling him out for

247
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,439
this uh because I I don't think it's

248
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,079
right that they should publ publish this

249
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,000
in a peer paper and not then not share

250
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,799
the

251
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,639
material the other mechanism we can uh

252
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:41,199
we can look at is a susceptibility gene

253
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,560
mediated mechanism this should have

254
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,160
broader Spectrum resistance and would

255
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:50,319
typically be recessive and there was a

256
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:54,759
nice paper published in 2021 by uh Pepin

257
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,680
at all describing the mlo milu Lo Locus

258
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:00,679
o Gene family and Cannabis sativa with

259
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,039
two strong genes uh as candidates for

260
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,278
powdery milde

261
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:07,199
susceptibility so we have here some

262
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:09,399
Frameworks for what we might expect in

263
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
terms of mechanism of powdery M

264
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,879
resistance in that FL

265
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,880
58

266
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,759
cultivar so we took that FL 58 and

267
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,639
crossed it with a susceptible line one

268
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,600
of our favorite uh varieties called TJ

269
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,320
CBD uh pretty

270
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,800
susceptible and uh then looked at the F1

271
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,879
and the

272
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:36,679
uh F1 had variable levels of

273
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:40,000
susceptibility we only looked at a small

274
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:42,638
handful uh but again these are now audpc

275
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,600
area under the disease progress curve

276
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,159
graphs uh on the left from a mistro

277
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,480
inoculation that Ali did and on the

278
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,958
right from a field trial again you can

279
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,199
see FL 58 resistant in the field trial

280
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,078
and a range of susceptibilities across

281
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:01,359
the

282
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:05,359
F1 uh so that uh immediately sort of

283
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:10,159
rules out that dominant R Gene

284
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,919
hypothesis uh pretty much I think uh

285
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,360
because we are seeing a range of

286
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:18,439
susceptibilities we pick two of those F1

287
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,480
individuals and self them and hemp is

288
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,560
dous but you can trick a female plant to

289
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,278
make pollen allowing you to

290
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:30,599
self-pollinate

291
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:33,879
it and uh generated two segregating F2

292
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:37,199
populations uh both with about three a

293
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:39,360
little more than 300 350 individuals and

294
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:40,719
planted those out in a field trial in

295
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,759
Geneva in

296
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,560
2021 and Ali again very rigorously uh

297
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:51,439
surveyed this population to generate

298
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:54,198
these very nice audpc curves and I have

299
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,600
shown the two different F2 populations

300
00:13:54,198 --> 00:14:01,719
here in different graphs where we see

301
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,000
that 25% of the F2 are scored as

302
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,360
resistant essential essentially zero

303
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,480
audpc

304
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,159
aligned with the ll58

305
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:16,079
parent uh TJ's is again moderately

306
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:20,319
susceptible but across the other 75% of

307
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:21,838
the population we see a range of

308
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:27,560
susceptibility

309
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:29,800
okay so that does fit uh this model of a

310
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:33,758
single Gene

311
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:33,758
recessive uh susceptibility

312
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:43,120
Gene so we genotyped those 700ish F2

313
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:46,278
individuals we used uh an aluminum array

314
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,399
array that was developed by phos

315
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:52,679
bioscience uh even though there were

316
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,720
55,000 Snips we only had 2700 that were

317
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:57,958
useful uh for George to build the

318
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,800
linkage map I'll just say these two

319
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:03,879
individuals we have now sequence these

320
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:08,319
and have highquality phase genome

321
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:10,000
Assemblies of them FL 58 is highly

322
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,519
inbred and very

323
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,198
homozygous and TJ CBD looks like it is a

324
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,519
true F1 hybrid cul of art uh so those

325
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:23,120
were interesting choices in terms of the

326
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,480
genomics and and George has a manuscript

327
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,560
we're about to

328
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,120
submit uh that describes some of the

329
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,919
interesting uh comp comparative genomics

330
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,759
that we're working on right now anyway

331
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:37,679
the phos array work pretty well for us

332
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,639
uh spread across the genome even though

333
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:44,519
it was designed to hiy THC

334
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:47,519
lines and uh when he did the qtl mapping

335
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,759
we saw a very highly significant uh

336
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,560
single Peak on chromosome

337
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:57,560
one and then some other smaller minor

338
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:59,479
Peaks on chromosomes 2 48 and

339
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:03,119
N uh

340
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,278
so looking at that Peak again we had

341
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,159
pretty tight and strong uh support for

342
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:10,639
that

343
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:14,000
interval and when you look at the

344
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:17,560
genotypes and line them up with the

345
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,799
phenotype it does point to a recessive

346
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:25,518
mechanism for a lack of

347
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:27,799
susceptibility uh while among the other

348
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,639
uh the heterozygous and

349
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:34,479
homozygous uh

350
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:37,879
susceptible Al there is quite a range of

351
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,399
AUD PCS across the rest of that

352
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:43,318
material so a pretty strong effect of

353
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,000
this Locus on chromosome one and lo and

354
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:49,559
behold uh within that or very close to

355
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,159
that confidence interval is this CLA 5

356
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:55,919
csm1 Gene that was predicted by the

357
00:16:53,159 --> 00:17:00,639
Pepin paper as being a good candidate

358
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:03,639
for susceptibility very close to our p

359
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:07,000
marker so uh I mentioned we sequenced

360
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:11,160
those two parents FL 58 and TJ

361
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,240
CBD uh did pack bio sequencing and omnic

362
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,120
uh to get a nice phased

363
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:23,199
assembly and again lo and behold uh in

364
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:26,479
the uh resistant FL 58 cultivar there is

365
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:30,480
a large insertion in that mll1 Gene

366
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,400
about 6.8 KB a portion of it looks like

367
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,279
a transposable element and that

368
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,600
insertion does result in a different

369
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:39,798
differentially spice differentially

370
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,000
spliced

371
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:44,879
transcript which would have a premature

372
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,599
stop codeon and disrupt function of that

373
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,600
susceptibility

374
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,038
protein uh the interesting thing we were

375
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:55,599
pretty concerned about this early on and

376
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll show you in the next slide how we

377
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:02,599
resolve this when we started doing rtpc

378
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,079
R of this Gene we were also detecting a

379
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:08,319
fulllength open reading

380
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:10,240
frame uh so that caused us some concern

381
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:14,158
how can how can

382
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,200
this uh cultivar be resistant if it has

383
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,799
if it's producing functional

384
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,360
susceptibility

385
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:24,798
protein so we spent quite a bit of time

386
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:27,798
working on this and uh did

387
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:31,119
rtpcr uh from both uninoculated and

388
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:33,798
inoculated plant so that's the open bar

389
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,918
versus the hatched bar but really I want

390
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:39,558
you to focus on the green bars which is

391
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:43,480
the proportion of transcript that has

392
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:46,200
the premature stop cat on uh so the

393
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,679
disrupted transcript and when we looked

394
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:53,400
at FL 58 yes we can just we can detect a

395
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,759
very small amount of that full length

396
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,440
transcript but the vast majority of

397
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:02,400
transcript that's being produced is the

398
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,360
def the interrupted version of the

399
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,960
gene uh I'm going to show you on the

400
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:10,479
next slide we've developed some markers

401
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:14,159
uh to detect that insertion in the mll1

402
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,640
Gene and those markers pointed us to

403
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:19,000
some other germ plasm that we had which

404
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,880
was

405
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,640
heterozygous and so you can see again in

406
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,760
a heterozygote for that insertion we're

407
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,960
seeing about half of the full length

408
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:31,319
transcript and about half of of the

409
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,440
transcript with the insertion and at

410
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:36,279
least in this line we do see an

411
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,840
upregulation uh upon inoculation of the

412
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,839
expression of that ml1

413
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:47,798
Gene so now we have uh a few good

414
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:50,440
markers linked to that mll1 oal that has

415
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:53,240
the insertion which is a effectively a

416
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,440
knockout of the susceptibility gene we

417
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,519
can now use those markers to

418
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:03,200
integress that uh Locus into other Elite

419
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,158
germ plasms both we like to use Pace

420
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,600
markers uh so we have a couple of

421
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,960
different pace markers as well as gel

422
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:13,319
based markers where we can clearly see

423
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,319
the segregation of that

424
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,799
insertion so I that was a very nice

425
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:21,558
story it it all wrapped up everything

426
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,599
makes sense it all wrapped up into a

427
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:27,558
very nice package uh as a chapter in

428
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:30,399
georg's dissertation the next step we do

429
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:34,038
want to do additional more detailed RNA

430
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,000
seek uh to look at the expression of

431
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:40,400
that M1 Gene and the other CA 5

432
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,279
M1 uh mlo Gene which is

433
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:47,200
mll4 uh my student Lou venal will is

434
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,639
working on on all of these follow-up

435
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,080
questions uh we're very interested to

436
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:56,280
see if it will confer resistance in

437
00:20:53,079 --> 00:21:00,319
other genetic backgrounds and whether

438
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:02,440
that mll1 knockout uh confers any uh

439
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,798
debilitated phenotype because that's

440
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,759
often the case with these susceptibility

441
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,679
genes we have not seen that so far with

442
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,839
FL

443
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:15,640
58 and we're also very interested in uh

444
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,798
the resistance mechanisms between hot

445
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,240
powdery mildew and hemp po powdery

446
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:24,038
mildew and whether we have resistance

447
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,720
genes to those alternate pathogens uh

448
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:28,879
resistance to hot powdery mildew and

449
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,400
hemp or resistance to hemp powdery M do

450
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,240
in hop so that's something that Lou is

451
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,400
working on as

452
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,480
well uh so we are she has been

453
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,000
ingressing it into other

454
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,640
backgrounds and uh making crosses to get

455
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,720
it into the homoa state and we have also

456
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,559
been working with the USDA germplasm

457
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,440
repository to screen other material and

458
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:55,359
search for other sources of powdery M

459
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,159
resistance maybe we will find that pm1

460
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:01,079
Gene in other genotypes and won't have

461
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,840
to go back to Dey scientific uh to beg

462
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,839
them again for

463
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,399
that uh I'll pause here any questions

464
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,798
about the powdery milary story before I

465
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,798
move on to

466
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,600
herbivores

467
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:21,839
okay so again I a benefit of doing all

468
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,918
of these small plot variety trials it

469
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,319
was a lot of work it's a pain in the

470
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,640
butt uh getting the seed from all these

471
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:32,960
companies and and doing all the f typing

472
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:36,679
is yet you do learn interesting

473
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,120
things and again in 2019 we planted out

474
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:42,159
all of these grain and fiber varieties

475
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,399
in small plot trials and the observation

476
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,840
that George made was that some of them

477
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,840
were really getting hammered primarily

478
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:52,519
by Japanese beetle which is a pest that

479
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,759
we have a lot of that they don't have a

480
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:59,079
lot of in some other big hemp growing

481
00:22:54,759 --> 00:23:01,519
regions like Colorado and Oregon

482
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,759
uh they really preferred these four

483
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:07,879
varieties shaded in Blue uh which happen

484
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:10,119
to all come from the breeding program in

485
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,919
Ukraine and the other feature of those

486
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:15,719
four is that they are all cannabinoid

487
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:19,080
free so that's a pretty strong

488
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,319
correlation that the four canabo free

489
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:25,119
lines uh just get hammered by Leaf

490
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,038
feeding beetles whereas pretty much

491
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,519
everything else that's making

492
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,319
cannabinoids uh has at best a low level

493
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:34,918
of

494
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:38,158
herbivory there are reports in in the

495
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:41,679
literature that canabo uh may have some

496
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,000
effects on arthropod health and

497
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,840
feeding uh so again I think we had some

498
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,038
good hypotheses that we could test uh to

499
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:54,158
see what the role is of canabo on uh at

500
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:56,519
least this this type of leaf feeding

501
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,880
herbivore so I have to give you a short

502
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:02,359
background on can aboid

503
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,960
biochemistry uh if you're a hemp or

504
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:09,079
cannabis scientist uh this is a a lot of

505
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,919
what we all think about is canabo uh on

506
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:13,960
the med medicinal

507
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:17,799
side uh but here we're we're looking at

508
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:20,120
these on the field crop side uh so this

509
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:23,519
is a very simple diagram of the

510
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:25,759
biosynthetic pathway combine gpp and

511
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,918
olivetolic acid to make what they call

512
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:32,158
the mother of all cannabinoids CBG and

513
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,038
then depending on which synthes enzyme

514
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,240
is present in those

515
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:39,640
tricomes uh you will either uh use that

516
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:44,000
CBG as a substrate to make

517
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:47,799
CBD or if you have thca synthes uh you

518
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,798
can convert that CVG into

519
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:56,000
THC uh so again those it depending on

520
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,399
the combination or the expression of

521
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,440
those two enzymes we have different

522
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:05,519
cannabinoid chemotypes as we described

523
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:09,159
them if you do if the plant lacks active

524
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:13,038
cbda synthes it will only make thca

525
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:17,000
synthes we call that chemotype 1 that is

526
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:19,798
uh the adult use uh drug

527
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,960
type but you might have plants that are

528
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:25,158
expressing each enzyme and if you have

529
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,600
both enzymes present in those tricomes

530
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:30,840
they will make about an equal ratio of

531
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:33,879
CBD and THC we call that chemotype

532
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:37,240
2 it is also

533
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:41,039
non-compliant uh so it's still not

534
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,720
classified as hemp in that case hemp is

535
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:46,798
uh chemotype 3 uh so it is not

536
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,839
expressing any active thca

537
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:53,119
synthes it only expresses active cbda

538
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:56,439
synthes thus we get cbda

539
00:25:53,119 --> 00:26:00,119
CBD uh the twist here is that that cbda

540
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:04,840
synthes is promisc promiscuous and makes

541
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:09,278
a little bit of THC in a about a 25 to1

542
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:11,558
ratio so hemp does make THC and if you

543
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:15,640
do that calculation when you get to

544
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:18,398
about a seven or 8% by dry weight CBD

545
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,679
line it will exceed the

546
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:25,119
0.3% THC

547
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:30,240
threshold then it's no longer hemp uh so

548
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,239
as John McKay says hemp is a phenotype

549
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:37,319
think about that uh we can also find

550
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,440
lines where both enzymes are knocked out

551
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:43,398
and then we see the accumulation of the

552
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,360
precursor uh so CBG dominant lines are

553
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:50,558
chemotype

554
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:53,759
4 uh and so we now know that those two

555
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:57,319
synthes genes cbda synthes and thca

556
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:59,240
synthes sit very close to each other on

557
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:01,319
chromosome 7

558
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,440
at a region that we call has been named

559
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,398
the B

560
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,840
Locus uh we have not detected any

561
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:11,558
recombination between those two genes uh

562
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:15,278
so we can effectively treat them as

563
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:18,558
alals with and they display melan

564
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:23,359
inheritance and we also have lines that

565
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:26,519
again either have a knockout in the thca

566
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:30,519
synthes gene we would we calling that

567
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:33,759
bt0 or BT null a knockout in the cbda

568
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:36,319
synthes we can call that BD null and we

569
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,879
also find lines that have the entire

570
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:42,079
region

571
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:45,840
deleted uh so we call that the B null

572
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:48,798
Al so then you can uh look at these

573
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,240
different ala combinations again

574
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:54,798
typically hemp would be homozygous for

575
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,079
the cbda synthes it would be chemotype 3

576
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,960
but if it was heterozygous for the

577
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:01,398
active cbda

578
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,600
and some knockout it would also be

579
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:06,918
chemotype 3 you have to be homozygous

580
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:11,599
for that b null or one of those other

581
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:14,679
Knockouts to be cha Type 4

582
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:18,759
okay and then finally we can also find

583
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:22,399
Knockouts in the Upstream enzymes in the

584
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:23,398
pathway for example Knockouts in all AIC

585
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:25,719
acid

586
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:30,079
synthase which totally eliminate

587
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:33,798
cannaboids so we're not making any CVG

588
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:37,079
either and that is chemotype 5

589
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:39,319
cannabinoid free okay and that is

590
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:42,000
determined Again by a single Locus that

591
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:45,519
has been named the O Locus so if you're

592
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,880
homozygous for uh the little o alil you

593
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,919
are cannabinoid free if you're

594
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,200
heterozygous you make very low levels of

595
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,919
cannabinoid and you have to be

596
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,840
homozygous for the bigo alal of that

597
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,440
olivetolic acid synthese to be truly

598
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:01,439
canabo

599
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,640
company so uh John mccay's lab Patrick

600
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:09,759
Woods in his group uh generated a

601
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,320
mapping population by Crossing one of

602
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:16,278
these canabo free cultivars Uso 31 from

603
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:19,879
Ukraine with an Italian fiber variety

604
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:22,319
carola and generated a segregating F2

605
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:26,880
population which he shared with

606
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:29,158
us and uh it turns out that that F2

607
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:33,278
population was was very nicely

608
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:37,000
segregating he used a single F1 and self

609
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:40,038
that so it was a true F2 population and

610
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,960
that F1 was heterozygous at both the B

611
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:46,119
and the O Losi so we have very nice 9

612
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:50,000
to4 to3

613
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:53,759
segregation uh if of of cannaboid

614
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,359
competence and production of CBD versus

615
00:29:53,759 --> 00:30:00,480
CBG so let me walk you through

616
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:03,199
this uh so this is is a log scale of

617
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,079
total cannabinoids so high cannabinoid

618
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,679
on the right and essentially cannabinoid

619
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,960
free on the

620
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,080
left and that makes sense when you look

621
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:16,399
at the little o homozygotes here the

622
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:20,558
light blue down to the light yellow are

623
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:24,278
all in this canabo free

624
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:27,200
group uh so those are the chemotype 5

625
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:31,960
plants and then if you look across this

626
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:34,080
line the homozygous B null genotypes are

627
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,880
going to be chemotype 4 they're going to

628
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,119
make CBG so the vertical scale is the

629
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,519
proportion of

630
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:45,599
CBG uh so all those High CBG lines the

631
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:49,359
chemotype 4 lines are at the top and the

632
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,959
rest are uh the chemotype 3 uh CBD

633
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:54,079
dominant

634
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,798
lines so that gave us a very nice

635
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:59,558
segregating population to look at the

636
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:03,038
role of cannaboid

637
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:06,398
competence and we could also compare CBD

638
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:09,798
versus CBG uh from this

639
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,959
population so George planted it out in

640
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:16,319
uh paired field trials one in Geneva one

641
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:19,159
in Ithaca in 2021 he rated herbivory

642
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:21,319
weekly uh which and then generated what

643
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:22,278
we call area under the herbivory

644
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:26,038
progress

645
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:29,398
curves and we also uh measured folar

646
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:30,960
cannabinoids by hplc

647
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:33,038
uh and Stephen again looked at

648
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,000
differences in triome density and

649
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:38,398
morphology in a subset of these

650
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,200
plants uh this is a nice phenotype you

651
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:45,119
like to see right I'm I'm not a stats

652
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,960
expert but uh I don't you don't really

653
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:50,319
need stats when this is your result yeah

654
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:53,200
we do need stats but I'll show you those

655
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:56,678
next so the plant on the right is

656
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:00,080
chemotype 5 cannaboid free uh just got

657
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,880
hammered by some Leaf beeding herbivore

658
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:04,558
probably Japanese beetle but it could

659
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:07,240
have been slugs it could have been

660
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:11,519
something else we're not entirely sure

661
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:16,880
of that and the cannaboid competent uh

662
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:19,638
CBD line on the left relatively little

663
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,880
herbivory this is a graph on the scale

664
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:27,678
of herbivore damage expressed as the log

665
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:30,159
a uhpc plus one okay so keep that in

666
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:34,120
mind mind the bottom line is that we do

667
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:36,080
see a significant difference in area

668
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:39,079
under the herbivory progress curve

669
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:42,960
between the cannaboid free lines in this

670
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:45,879
F2 population versus either the CBD

671
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,079
dominant or CBG dominant lines there was

672
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,480
much more herbivory in itha than there

673
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,158
was in Geneva I that was a local

674
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,399
environmental

675
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:59,480
effect uh but still significant uh

676
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:02,638
difference between the Canam 3 and

677
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,639
cannaboid competent

678
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,798
lines uh again here we're graphing the

679
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:12,200
log of total canabo so high canabo on

680
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:14,879
the right low canabo on the left and in

681
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,278
both sites uh we see a significant

682
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,880
negative relationship between

683
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,880
herbivory and uh cannabinoid

684
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:27,119
concentration but that's all in the

685
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:29,599
field again we didn't really know

686
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,319
exactly who was chewing on those

687
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:35,879
leaves uh so we wanted to try to counter

688
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:38,918
any criticism about that by bringing

689
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,200
leaves inside and putting them in a a no

690
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:42,200
choice

691
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,200
bioassay uh this is where we got the

692
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,600
help from ping Wang he provided us

693
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,759
cabbage Looper from his colony and

694
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:51,839
George picked out six CBD dominant wines

695
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:55,638
and six cannaboid free

696
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:58,319
lines uh and did three reps of feeding

697
00:33:55,638 --> 00:34:00,678
with one cabbage Looper per leaf

698
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:04,638
and then measured mortality position on

699
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:06,519
the leaf area consumed and final mass of

700
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:09,598
that

701
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:11,280
cabage so again they perform much better

702
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,200
on cannaboid free

703
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,639
leaves uh

704
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:19,439
significantly more Leaf area consumed of

705
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,480
the cannabinoid free lines a

706
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,079
significantly greater mass of the

707
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,679
Cabbage Looper on canabo free lines and

708
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,519
significantly I think this is

709
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:32,760
significantly greater mortality on the

710
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:35,358
CBD leaves than on the cannaboid free

711
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,720
leaves all of that

712
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:42,199
fits and the other interesting thing is

713
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,439
that uh these cannaboid free lines

714
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:47,838
normally

715
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:50,440
these uh cesil glandular tricomes are

716
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:52,199
the site of cannabinoid

717
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,838
biosynthesis you can see in the

718
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:58,358
cannaboid competent leaves they're very

719
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,239
swollen this interesting observation

720
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:03,480
that Steven made that they seem to be

721
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,799
collapsed in the cannaboid Freel line

722
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:09,800
also that there's a much higher density

723
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,560
of tricomes on the leaf on the abaxial

724
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,320
side

725
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:19,400
uh uh on the bottom side then on the top

726
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:21,800
side the ad axial side and when George

727
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,440
looked at the position of those cabbage

728
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,599
Loopers that fit right so there were

729
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:33,000
much they were much more likely to be on

730
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:35,760
the abaxial side on the cannabinoid free

731
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,358
lines than they were on the canabo

732
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,960
competent lines uh because that's where

733
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:46,000
all the CBD

734
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:46,000
is uh on these CH chemotype 3

735
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,039
leaves okay so again just these are

736
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,480
whole leaves maybe there were

737
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:55,199
differences in the toughness of the leaf

738
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,880
when you talk to entomologists right

739
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,358
they want to know what was that

740
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,358
toughness of the Lea Leaf what was a

741
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:02,078
nitrogen content in the leaf what was a

742
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:05,838
water

743
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,200
content okay so we'll do artificial diet

744
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:11,318
assays then eliminating all of those

745
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:13,838
sort of tissue effects so we worked with

746
00:36:11,318 --> 00:36:16,519
this company cerona Labs who had a nice

747
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:19,838
water soluble cannaboid Emulsion

748
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:22,599
Incorporated it into the insect diet and

749
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:26,159
uh George did both an incorporation

750
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:29,559
formula and then also painted the canabo

751
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,559
on the surface of the DI

752
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:36,519
uh and again the Cabbage Loopers grew

753
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:40,880
much less on the diet with cannabinoids

754
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:44,960
integrated into it and there was a

755
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:48,440
significant effect on Final Mass uh with

756
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,880
higher levels of CBD and CB well this is

757
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,519
not significant but numerically

758
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,079
different uh the surface bioassay

759
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:59,480
actually worked a little bit better and

760
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,960
gave us the ability to do a little more

761
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,079
range of

762
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,880
concentration and we did see a dosage

763
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,000
effect uh with only 0.01% CBD no

764
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:13,400
significant difference in percent

765
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,800
survival but if you go up to 0.1 uh

766
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,800
significant decrease in survival and uh

767
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,359
we killed every all the Cabbage Loopers

768
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,200
with 1%

769
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:29,039
CBD and most of them with 1%

770
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:31,960
CBG uh so all of those data fit the

771
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:35,358
story uh leading us to to this

772
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,880
conclusion that herbivory damage is

773
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:39,679
related to cannaboid

774
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,000
concentration uh

775
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:46,879
that uh our our cabbage Loopers perform

776
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,318
better uh so it wasn't just something

777
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,318
happening in the field it wasn't

778
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:53,480
something about Leaf

779
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:57,000
toughness uh because we we also saw the

780
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,679
same effect with artificial diets and we

781
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,920
came to the conclusion that probably

782
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:05,199
breeding cannabinoid free

783
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:09,639
cultivars is a bad idea not a good

784
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:11,000
idea but we can breed for high CBG lines

785
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:14,920
this chemotype

786
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,358
4 which produce essentially no

787
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:21,838
THC uh so they will be essentially

788
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:24,519
cannabinoid free uh sorry THC free but

789
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:27,639
not canabo free and should still be able

790
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:29,838
to defend themselves against herbivores

791
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,480
now I want to I'm showing a picture of a

792
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:35,519
corn earworm

793
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:37,559
because uh corn earworm goes right for

794
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,679
the high CBD

795
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:42,599
flowers

796
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:46,118
so the hypothesis there is that corn air

797
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:49,160
worm don't care about CBD uh because

798
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:51,280
that's where we find them in the plant

799
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:53,960
uh same thing with cannabis

800
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,560
Aid uh so cannabis aphid is very

801
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:00,559
abundant in the top parts of the of the

802
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:02,838
CBD flower at the end of the season so

803
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:06,039
I'm not going to say that this is a

804
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:08,318
silver bullet for all insect problems uh

805
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:11,759
but it does seem to have some effect on

806
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:11,759
those Leaf feeding

807
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,079
herbivores uh so I will wrap things up I

808
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:19,799
need to thank uh the very generous

809
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,760
funding we've gotten from New York State

810
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,960
through primarily through agen markets

811
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,880
but also also through uh office of

812
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,480
cannabis management and Empire State

813
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,559
development

814
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,480
uh we have had uh grants from industry

815
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:37,920
and this project on Powder Milo was

816
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,679
funded by FF in cooperation with

817
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,318
Scots and uh please email me or check

818
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:45,039
out our website if you have any other

819
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:47,440
questions so I would be happy to take

820
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:52,000
questions

821
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:55,358
now about 10 minutes for Larry to see

822
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,318
how we are going to vote as a faculty

823
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,318
yeah first question from a gr

824
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:05,358
great to see

825
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:13,199
you I was wondering about the like

826
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:17,119
there's tradeoffs invol that

827
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:19,639
out uh yeah so that that is often often

828
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:23,880
by knocking out the susceptibility

829
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:27,000
gene you see an impact on Vigor in other

830
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,318
systems and uh we have not seen that we

831
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,318
don't really know what the function of

832
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:38,279
those S Gene proteins

833
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:38,279
is uh yeah it's still an open

834
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,480
question would you

835
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:49,480
ever a type

836
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:59,239
of fiber or would you ever that those or

837
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:06,960
yeah so there are some very mature hemp

838
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,838
Industries uh in Europe and in

839
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,960
China

840
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:14,799
and we I think we in the US are only

841
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,000
just beginning to learn how those mature

842
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,400
Industries are

843
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,440
performing uh I was just at a conference

844
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,119
where I heard a talk from the president

845
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,000
of the largest hemp company in the world

846
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:30,000
in

847
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:33,559
China and they grow grow hemp in a very

848
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,119
specific way and harvest it and process

849
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:38,519
it in a very specific way to get textile

850
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:43,760
grade

851
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:45,358
fiber uh it doesn't go to seed so no

852
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,560
they're not going to get textile grade

853
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:52,000
fiber and grain from the same

854
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:53,599
plant and uh they don't get any herd

855
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,838
either because they're harvesting before

856
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,000
the accumulation of any

857
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:02,679
herd in contrast uh there is a mature

858
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,079
grain industry in Canada in Manitoba

859
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:07,239
Alberta

860
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:10,440
Saskatchewan and they have they have

861
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:13,239
never collected any of the straw they

862
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,920
only their crop grows about four feet

863
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:17,118
tall they combine it with their big huge

864
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,760
wide

865
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,559
combines uh and they are the largest

866
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,680
producer of EMP grain you could buy it

867
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:28,400
in the store from Manitoba

868
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:30,960
Harvest uh called hemp parts

869
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,240
uh so those are two mature hemp

870
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,880
industries that are single

871
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:39,078
purpose so whether we can develop

872
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,599
multi-purpose crops that are profitable

873
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:45,240
and actually meet the needs of the end

874
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:49,039
users we do the economic modeling of

875
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:50,479
that and it comes out beneficial but uh

876
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,920
what I understand right now is that the

877
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:58,119
end users are not going to want those

878
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,119
products from Dual Purpose crops

879
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,318
I think I tried this in Parts visited

880
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,960
you that one time

881
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:08,679
tasty High Am protein yeah omega3 and

882
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:12,318
omega-6 fatty

883
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:12,318
acid chickens love

884
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:27,159
them yeah so uh sorry I should be

885
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,119
repeating the question so the uh

886
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:30,118
question is uh there only about 200

887
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,559
acres of

888
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:35,680
hemp uh I don't know the exact numbers

889
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,079
of how many acres of cannabis there are

890
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,358
I would

891
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:42,960
guess I'm going to guess somewhere

892
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:45,239
probably around four three or 400 Acres

893
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,039
of outdoor grown

894
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:52,439
cannabis

895
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:55,639
uh so what is our Outreach strategy

896
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,440
uh my Outreach strategy is to provide

897
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:59,480
knowledge to Growers and allow them to

898
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,760
make the choice of whether they want to

899
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:05,199
grow hemp there has to be a market first

900
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,960
and we do not have any hemp processors

901
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:10,399
in New York state again I have a

902
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,318
decorticator and I am the only one in

903
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,480
the Northeast with a hemp

904
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:17,838
decorticator uh so we need some

905
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,599
investment in hemp processing before I

906
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:24,838
would ever suggest uh a hemp farmer to

907
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:28,119
to plant the hemp but I think now we we

908
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:29,759
have we have uh delivered Field Days

909
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,880
every year since

910
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,520
2017 the high the best attendant

911
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,000
attended one had about 260 people this

912
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:41,280
year we had about 150 people so there is

913
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
definitely interest and we show people

914
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,079
how to grow hemp

915
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:50,639
effectively uh for fiber grain and

916
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:54,000
CBD uh we just need the processing

917
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:57,519
infrastructure and uh we need less

918
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,159
regulation that's also true

919
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:05,400
okay so we had a lot of CBD hemp growers

920
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:07,558
in 2019 we grew about 2,000 or 2500

921
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:11,039
Acres of CBD

922
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:13,519
hemp the market crashed but then New

923
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,079
York State this was the only state in

924
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:19,199
the country that did

925
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:23,559
this uh authorized our experienced hemp

926
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:25,960
Growers to then get a cannabis grows

927
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:28,880
license so everywhere else in the

928
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,400
country you cannot have both licenses

929
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,400
you can't grow hemp and cannabis on the

930
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,519
same

931
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,240
Farm uh so New York was pretty unique

932
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:43,358
and saying okay hemp Growers you can now

933
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:45,039
start growing cannabis go for it and so

934
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,078
all of my

935
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:50,318
clientele uh then started growing

936
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:54,839
cannabis pretty much and uh we are not

937
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:58,318
allowed to provide extension to uh still

938
00:45:54,838 --> 00:46:00,639
schedule one drug produc

939
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:02,519
users all just Qui question for the New

940
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:06,400
York State Office of

941
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:10,280
cannabis is do they oversee hemp as well

942
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:15,000
so they do oversee uh not the licensing

943
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:18,880
but the uh product side of

944
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,880
CBD and sales of

945
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,800
CBD years ago at the height of f of CBD

946
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,800
marketing

947
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,800
fromr identified

948
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:33,318
what does it look like

949
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:42,159
now yeah so the the question is uh for

950
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:43,519
me to describe uh the roller coaster of

951
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:47,440
the CBD

952
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:49,719
industry yeah so again hemp people

953
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,760
started being able to grow hemp in after

954
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:56,399
the 2014 farm bill and States had to

955
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,520
pass their their pilot program every

956
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,039
state was different but it really was

957
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:04,639
the 2018 farm bill so some early States

958
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:06,519
Kentucky Colorado Oregon got started

959
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:10,199
ahead of everyone

960
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:11,838
else uh we got started our plan was

961
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:14,519
passed in late

962
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:17,799
2016 uh we started planting grain and

963
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:20,639
fiber hemp initially but then in 2018 it

964
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:24,039
became clear that CBD was going to be

965
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:28,838
the thing and 2019 after the 2018 farm

966
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:28,838
bill pass people went berserk

967
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:35,079
uh I'll give you an

968
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,559
example uh there is a probably the best

969
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:40,318
seed producer for CBD hemp was a company

970
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:43,400
in Oregon called Oregon

971
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:47,599
CBD and estimates I've heard is that

972
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:49,880
they sold 300 million seeds in 2019 at a

973
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,039
dollar a

974
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,240
piece dollar a piece wow you're in the

975
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:55,239
right

976
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,880
business so that the owner Seth Crawford

977
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,960
of Oregon CBD is a very clever guy very

978
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,280
scientifically oriented he was a member

979
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,119
of the FF hemp research

980
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:12,880
Consortium he bought a pack bio

981
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:14,640
sequencer and started sequencing genomes

982
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,880
working with Kelly Vining at Oregon

983
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:20,118
State and Todd Michael at

984
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,519
sulk and uh they have now leveraged that

985
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:27,720
all of those data into a Pang

986
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:30,880
genome uh so we now have 75 B

987
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:34,799
uh genomes from that era thanks

988
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,800
to the estimated $300 million that he

989
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,920
made in

990
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:43,079
2019 people were paying uh you know if

991
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,519
you're planting 2500 plants an acre

992
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:48,000
you're paying $2,500 just for the seed

993
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:50,000
per acre and some people were planting

994
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,880
40

995
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,440
acres uh there were 60,000 acres in the

996
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,920
state of Oregon in

997
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,880
2019 uh based on all that

998
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:05,400
overproduction processors we went and

999
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:08,559
visited uh Charlotte's Web a company in

1000
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:11,000
Colorado uh when we were on sabatical

1001
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,119
they were still processing pemp that was

1002
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,358
grown in

1003
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:18,280
2019 in

1004
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:20,279
2023 so what we're being told is that

1005
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,960
the processors are finally now have

1006
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,240
finally gotten through all of the

1007
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:28,920
backlog of biomass from

1008
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:32,000
2019 and uh there is now finally an

1009
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:34,039
uptick on the grower side for the price

1010
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,599
of CBD hemp and people are actually

1011
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:39,599
planting CBD hemp again but now the

1012
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,920
market is so thinned out that really the

1013
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,000
only survivors are companies that are

1014
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,318
vertically

1015
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,358
integrated that have a solid seed

1016
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:52,519
supplier grow their own hemp process it

1017
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:55,159

1029
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:27,318
it's an incredible company so they are a

1030
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:30,239
Survivor and a success story uh

1031
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:31,558
but very few other success stories in

1032
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,199
that

1033
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:37,798
industry uh we probably close here but

1034
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:41,279
just remind people as sarin had said

1035
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:44,400
there's a meeting at 5m on the which

1036
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:47,200
room was it Bradfield

1037
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,880
1102 there there's one question in the

1038
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:54,318
chat uh from Syria uh any idea whether

1039
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,358
spotted Lantern fly feeds on him uh and

1040
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:59,838
he wonders if there's a similar story as

1041
00:50:56,358 --> 00:51:02,358
cabage Looper uh so that's an excellent

1042
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:05,358
question we also share that same

1043
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:09,558
question for hot uh so spot and Lantern

1044
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:13,480
fly is coming in from the south is a big

1045
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:16,160
threat to our Vineyards for sure uh but

1046
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:19,358
we have not seen damage on hop and we

1047
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:23,239
have not seen damage on hemp so far

1048
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:25,960
so uh yeah but we need to wait until the

1049
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:27,118
populations are bigger for sure but uh

1050
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,519
at least for now

1051
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:35,358
now it does not seem to be a huge threat

1052
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:35,358
specifically to him great let's thank

1053
