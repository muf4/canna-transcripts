1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:12,320
University um so so when I kind of got

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,919
the invitation last year from gide and I

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,160
was like super honored but has you know

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,879
had to cancel at the last minute because

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,480
of some some unexpected healthy issues

7
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:25,079
we still kind of go through that process

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,679
um but then when I can of prepare for uh

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:30,759
this seminar I think is not only just a

10
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:33,039
seminar from can for the research view

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:36,159
is actually a pretty kind of interesting

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:39,200
and fun way to kind of revisit my

13
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:42,479
journey since join Cornell cuz um

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,039
believe or not um actually the first

15
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:49,078
official Cornell seminar I got invited

16
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:52,160
was from PL pass uh but dedicated in

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,759
Geneva and that's 2020 uh Kitty

18
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,640
mentioned you know we just started the

19
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,679
lab and that's the two student I have uh

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,280
one just graduated last of fall uh

21
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,838
actually started his own startup on

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,760
commercializing the robot he developed

23
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:08,879
and second PhD is still account of in

24
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,240
the pipeline and hopefully can graduate

25
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,599
soon sometime this fall um and then you

26
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,919
know 22 is really kind of a booming

27
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:19,158
stage for my lab and you can see from

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,640
three kind of people there looking at

29
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,159
each other most of the time just through

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,920
Zoom now we really have all of these

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,320
folks and they enjoy the inperson

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,840
activities and start to do the Synergy

33
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,719
as robotic sees address in many of these

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,680
Agriculture and food related issues and

35
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,679
last year we actually first time had

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,759
this cross lab meeting uh involving with

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,000
Kitty uh Lance and also chonun who is

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,040
also a new hire actually in food science

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,040
dedicated for technology for post

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,840
harvesting uh

41
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,399
evaluation um so with that I I still

42
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,840
want to kind of revisit that's actually

43
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,000
uh the the drop talk I gave at Cornell

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,039
back to 2019 and I still think this is

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,118
the kind of the key Vision we now uh not

46
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,399
only see that on the paper actually we

47
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:09,080
going to go through that through many of

48
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,878
the true products now working on daily

49
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,680
basis and support different uh programs

50
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,679
especially implant pathology um but the

51
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,640
basic kind of a concept is we really

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,480
want to kind of highlight using

53
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,439
technology as a middle layer to better

54
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,119
bridge between human and the

55
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,318
agricultural systems instead of using

56
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,840
you know tons of our wisdom and

57
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,839
knowledge and you know we can have a

58
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,200
technology lader to really more

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,719
quantitatively gather this knowledge and

60
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,919
hopefully can reserve them for many of

61
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:44,039
the future Generations in a different

62
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:46,199
way than just a writing books right and

63
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,639
one of the good example nowadays is like

64
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,518
we have all these AI systems especially

65
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,518
large language models and how those can

66
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,360
be used as a way to teach students we

67
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,280
Beyond cornal in my opinion that's

68
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,599
really kind of a passion as a

69
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,199
Technologies I can foresee for the

70
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,959
societal

71
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,158
benefits and then our kind of a story

72
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,598
really started with the food chain

73
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,959
solution right that's we call it a

74
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,798
systems engineering is it's not a

75
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,479
specific angle but to look at the whole

76
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,120
system and try to find oh what other we

77
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:21,000
weakness is there right or the aspects

78
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,360
to be improved and instead of putting a

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,080
lot of resources just solving a single

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,480
problem perhaps for each of these aspect

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,040
we make you know 1% better collectively

82
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:35,000
the give us not 5% but maybe 50%

83
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,199
improvements down the roow and and

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,680
that's really the vision there and we

85
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:43,518
kind of use the so-call multi modality

86
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,879
multikill sensing technology it's also

87
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,480
not just a ground robust where we got to

88
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:50,479
focus a lot today but we have you know

89
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,078
in collaboration with Lance we have the

90
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:56,199
backbird as more like a laboratory

91
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,000
microscopic Imaging robot that we can

92
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,798
gather the information really from the

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,799
web lab experiments and then translate

94
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,480
to the ground robot to get you know

95
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,560
submillimeter very high resolution

96
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:10,399
imagery and information from the

97
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,680
canopies of the plants in the field and

98
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,439
all the way to the Jone or uas based

99
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,918
imagery to get what the field looks like

100
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,918
right or what's this kind of whole

101
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,758
Vineyard or art looks like all the way

102
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,839
to how the New York State and the global

103
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,360
look like through the satellite remote

104
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,159
sensing technology and hopefully we can

105
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,800
also gather all this knowledge right

106
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,080
through from molecular all the way to

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,560
the global as well and in my opinion

108
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:41,000
that's where AI really really helpful

109
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,519
because we I mean as as human we have

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,639
limited power to really figure out very

111
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,439
complex relationships and that's really

112
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,199
these computational tools can help us in

113
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:53,478
the long

114
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,840
run and then when I kind of a look back

115
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,800
all right so we talk about from all the

116
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:02,239
way from breeding to pre-season inseason

117
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,120
post Harvest suppos Harvest Right um why

118
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,918
I just joined all the bottom part are

119
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,720
black okay so nothing there it's just a

120
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:14,918
blank page and we start fill in and in

121
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,600
the past four years around uh we kind of

122
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,359
fill in most of these major components

123
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,720
as I mentioned in collaboration with

124
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,840
Lance um and and uh in the early stage

125
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,720
also uh uh D garyi also from Plant

126
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:31,359
Pathology uh at Geneva uh we have this

127
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,280
microscopic image rubot and we actually

128
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,000
just um submitted a new Initiative for

129
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:40,679
USD ARS uh because the ARs kind of uh

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,279
leadership is very interested in pushing

131
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,038
this technology for all ARS Labs across

132
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:48,038
the country to uh do the highr

133
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:51,680
phenotyping to better understand the

134
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:53,800
plant responses to different stress um

135
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,038
stimulations and in the middle that's

136
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,960
where we do for uh not only the braiding

137
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,879
like we have field of Trials the

138
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,318
programs to evaluated their actual field

139
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:06,279
responses right to different diseases

140
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,759
but we also have the Drone systems that

141
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:13,159
really can be leveraged for faster and

142
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,240
kind of equivalently accurate sensing uh

143
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,439
capacity to the ground system and the

144
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,519
last piece actually is this new lab

145
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:24,800
scanner um G and I really work a lot

146
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:26,719
from the breeding right all the way to

147
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,120
how we manage the grip vines in the

148
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,440
field during the season and this is the

149
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,560
last is okay we got disease infection

150
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,719
for whatever reason and it the

151
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,000
management does not really take effectiv

152
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,160
this and we ended up with all these

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,560
infected GP berries and how at the last

154
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,840
step people can evaluate their defective

155
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,959
needs and really sort out the highest

156
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:56,519
quality that g still can gain the

157
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:59,598
monetary benefits rather than okay this

158
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:02,719
is a canly died one and we have no idea

159
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:05,399
how to make money from that and we just

160
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,800
kind of published this paper um last

161
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,758
year and hopefully to just continue uh

162
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,560
in collaboration with Terry Bas from

163
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:17,639
claro at Western New

164
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,079
York so that's the kind of a major thing

165
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,160
we have achieved but when I kind of

166
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,680
think about what's the vision right uh

167
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,039
for a roboticist to work with PL

168
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,639
pathology in a broader context this is a

169
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:36,478
kind of image I generated and I use I'm

170
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,800
a very passionated roboticist interested

171
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,519
in Plant Pathology question and my dream

172
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,598
is to help my colleague really dealing

173
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:47,799
with many of the daily scouting issues

174
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,680
please help me generate a figure to

175
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,280
demonstrate how this can be more

176
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,840
collaborative period That's the taex

177
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,439
promp it's very long but then just give

178
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,279
me this very beautiful image right and

179
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,759
that's exactly what I Vision U we still

180
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,079
need a lot of human pathologies in the

181
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,360
room to use our kind of natural

182
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,800
intelligence to advance the knowledge

183
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,240
really help people to understand this

184
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,360
knowledge but on the other hand we start

185
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,240
to have the robots to assist you as a

186
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,158
human

187
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,918
scientist again to better understand all

188
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:26,199
these interactions and hopefully to also

189
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:29,279
identify insights or any of the complex

190
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,639
relationships otherwise human ourself

191
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,879
can can not easily identify right so

192
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,399
when we can look at a two line of

193
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:39,519
numbers try to do regression yes we can

194
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,519
even manually draw the scatter P plot

195
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,200
and try to identify some relationship

196
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,839
there doesn't matter that's linear

197
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,399
nonlinear but when you have thousand

198
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,000
dimensions of the data the first

199
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:54,278
challenge to me is like okay I stop

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,399
working right the dimensionality is just

201
00:08:54,278 --> 00:09:00,120
a booming and how this Ai and Robotics

202
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:03,240
technology can help us

203
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,360
and then there another kind of a key I I

204
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,839
I did not really kind of see uh B

205
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,680
actually would be here but I'm so

206
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,760
appreciate you come um because that's

207
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,879
kind of ir relevant also in my opinion

208
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,759
to a very traditional field in Cornell

209
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,639
called agricultural engineer and I think

210
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:24,519
many of you who are senior really know

211
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:27,039
that department used to be actually the

212
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,799
leader uh not only in the country but

213
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,039
worldwide to push for all the

214
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,399
agriculture

215
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,679
mechanization um but somehow we kind of

216
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,720
achieved the entries and now we're

217
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,679
catching up for the digital agriculture

218
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,320
era and one of the key thing for or

219
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,039
challenge for all the agricultural

220
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,040
engineers in my opinion is we lack

221
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:50,039
actually a solid Science Foundation to

222
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,199
start with okay the analog I kind of try

223
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,120
to compare is when you consider biom

224
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,320
medical

225
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,959
engineering versus agriculture

226
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,600
engineering what's the key difference

227
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:03,679
there only the study object is different

228
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,360
one is for human health the other is for

229
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,519
plant health for Plant Pathology context

230
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,480
right other than that this just a

231
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,679
similar and actually plant give us more

232
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,759
advantages because we can create more

233
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,000
samples more replicates different

234
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,838
genetic sources and we can leverage all

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,958
these to really Advance our

236
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,200
understanding about the life

237
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:27,599
mechanisms in addition to you know just

238
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,600
help us to U manage the human disease

239
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,839
which is also very important but it's

240
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,320
just like we have a lot of other ethical

241
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:38,200
issues that we don't want to kind of

242
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,240
risk ourself right so PL actually is

243
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,320
very advantageous um but often time the

244
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:48,200
key thing is like I don't know where I

245
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,680
can start with from a science point do I

246
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,000
have a solid science framework to guide

247
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:55,719
my engineering advancement and hopefully

248
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,720
use this Advanced engineering

249
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,040
Technologies to better understand the

250
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:04,240
science as a Clos Loop so K and I kind

251
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,838
of chatted a lot over the covid and this

252
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,039
is really the figure I want to borrow

253
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,040
from her because this is a kind of a

254
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,240
very cool starting point as an engineer

255
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:14,199
to find the Science Foundation um when

256
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,000
we talk about the disease many of you I

257
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,000
believe know more than me we have the

258
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,360
host we have the pathogen and then we

259
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,919
have the environment and somehow because

260
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,200
of her program entries we add the

261
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,719
management explicitly but I still

262
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,639
consider that as a part of the

263
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,680
environment right um from the

264
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,600
engineering perspective sorry Kitty um

265
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:37,159
so we started with okay let's just a

266
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,320
pick this three U pathogen that's a can

267
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:41,360
of a different world in my opinion and

268
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,440
and we're GNA just put that aside a

269
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,120
little bit and we're g to find some hard

270
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,360
time later on so this is actually the

271
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,600
starting point okay 2019 uh December I

272
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,919
heard Carell has no tradition to close

273
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,759
the campus Because of snow but my first

274
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,639
day was a heavy snow and the campus was

275
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:03,679
closed I've been told your first day

276
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:07,200
will be holiday thank you Cornell

277
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,319
um um so that's actually the system um

278
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,399
so my colleagues already used in the

279
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,040
field to collect a lot images and try to

280
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,198
better understand what's the disease

281
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:20,000
resistance response in the field and

282
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:22,639
then um we start to come up with a more

283
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,839
automated kind of a concept on the right

284
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,480
hand side and you will be laughing oh

285
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,000
what that small kind of a toy robot can

286
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,360
do but that's our starting point right

287
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,198
we we start to add a GPS at different

288
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,800
sensors and start to automate the data

289
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:38,599
acquisition

290
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:41,120
process but what is really key is two

291
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,199
components there right when you talk

292
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,639
about autonomous field scouting we need

293
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:47,799
to actually solve two problems number

294
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,959
one we need a navigation system right

295
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,599
just as the Tesla that now can drive

296
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,518
just on the road we need the rubot to

297
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,399
just derse the whole vanard or allart or

298
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,320
fiill autonomously without any human

299
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,919
interference and the second component is

300
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,879
how the disease will be sensed from the

301
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,958
images we collected so that if we put

302
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:11,039
these two together okay yeah automous

303
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:15,078
disease scouting at least as a prototype

304
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,759
um so this is a published work um and

305
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:20,039
here we actually use a Pure Vision u

306
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,360
based guidance um on the left side

307
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:25,599
that's the input image seen by the

308
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,879
camera from the front view and then the

309
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,199
the right side is actually the AI based

310
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:34,399
Det determine determine passway the

311
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:36,399
robot should go forward to derse the

312
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,240
whole vanard without any human

313
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,600
interference and surprisingly we tested

314
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,240
that out in different you know field

315
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,560
conditions it generated very well so we

316
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,159
collect the data actually in one Kitt uh

317
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,799
Vineyard in Agri Tech and we test out

318
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:54,360
that during the winter time in

319
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,639
California uh you different V yards in

320
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,120
New York and they just all work pretty

321
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,519
nicely okay so that give us the

322
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,679
confidence all right we have the

323
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,078
navigation capacity here and then we

324
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:07,879
build the neuron Network right um which

325
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:10,399
is a kind of a bus word nowadays uh and

326
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:14,039
to really identify where these disease

327
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,120
infection regions are on the images um

328
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,958
and we also further optimize the neural

329
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,519
network so that we can get it faster and

330
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:24,319
can be deployed on the robot

331
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:29,360
directly and I put in these two together

332
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,759
um that that's I believe oh sure why

333
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,959
many of you have have seen this before

334
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:37,120
while the rubot traversing through the

335
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,679
venard we get the input image we got

336
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,639
where the disease are we get the

337
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:44,159
canopies are and then we also avoid any

338
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,720
of the overlapping between consecutive

339
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,120
images right because we don't want

340
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,720
double count anything there and if we

341
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,159
aggregate them all together we can get

342
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,759
the uh actual disease infection

343
00:14:54,159 --> 00:15:00,958
severity and the good thing is once we

344
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,839
have this robot right is no longer oh as

345
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,679
KT mentioned we need to have a group of

346
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:08,399
five or six send them all to the field

347
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:11,000
folks let's do the

348
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,879
scouting and after you know a week we

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,519
probably finish some kind of field

350
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,600
scouting and we know time is important

351
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,560
for Plant Pathology because disease is

352
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,519
not a static thing they keep developing

353
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,879
themselves so there are a lot of

354
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,360
variance there so what we found is

355
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:31,639
actually the scouting frequency is

356
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,199
really a right so we deploy this robot

357
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,519
based on a weekly basis and if we want

358
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:40,318
we can actually deploy that on daily

359
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:43,039
basis and the interesting thing is um we

360
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:46,318
oftentimes talk about asymptomatic

361
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:49,799
disease detection as the key information

362
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:51,159
for the GS to know okay I need to apply

363
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:54,198
preventive

364
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:56,519
mirors to suppress this disease pressure

365
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:59,479
right at the good starting

366
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,480
point and often times as symptomatic

367
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,079
disease detection is super

368
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,159
challenging um and that's really because

369
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,559
we have limited manpower to scale that

370
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:13,159
frequently and now with this robot can

371
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:15,958
autonomously SC the vard on a weekly

372
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:18,679
basis what we found is at the beginning

373
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,119
that's the map the Scot the the rubot

374
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:24,159
Gap if you can see if you can see my

375
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,519
cursor here and you see some of these

376
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:30,000
purple-ish blocks that's actually the

377
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,240
panels start to show very very early

378
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,839
symptom but if you look at the whole

379
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,959
vanard it seems like that's fine won't

380
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,839
really trigger any of the series

381
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,838
consideration but when you can of later

382
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,959
on all the way wait for you know three

383
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:49,600
weeks the human scouting really confirm

384
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:52,638
no you got serious disease issue and

385
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,120
this time window be in between is what

386
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,799
this rubot can really fill in right

387
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,480
because we don't have the limitation

388
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:02,278
because of the Manpower just deploy this

389
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,759
robot and you detect this map and as

390
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:07,640
early as you know just a week we we

391
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:09,798
already identify these hotspots and

392
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,520
hopefully if we come up with the right

393
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:17,359
management strategy we can contain them

394
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:20,038
well and avoid getting into this

395
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,918
situation so with that what we kind of

396
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:24,359
want to come with is let's kind of

397
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,400
explore further what about the frequency

398
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:30,359
of scouting can impact how the disease

399
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,400
management practices can be in the past

400
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,119
we have to wait for the scouting

401
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,840
Consultants coming in and tell us what

402
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:40,918
happened but now with this rubot if I do

403
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:43,359
frequently let's see push for even daily

404
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:46,240
basis what that can tell us what's the

405
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:49,000
new information we can leverage

406
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,240
there so the other thing I want to point

407
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,880
out is actually the improved scouting

408
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,200
sensitivity so this is a can of U

409
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,880
commercial vard in finger leaks region

410
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,880
and we are targeting to detect the g g

411
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,360
Leaf real virus right which has a very

412
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:08,240
obvious visual feature is like a radish

413
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:10,959
infection on Green Leaf right so that's

414
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,159
very kind of neat for this rubot to do

415
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,720
and what we found is in general the

416
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:20,240
rubot and human scouting align very well

417
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:24,600
like over 90% accuracy but for some of

418
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:27,839
the spots the rubot reported hey here if

419
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:31,959
you see this dot we got some diseases

420
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:34,558
there but human report n well interested

421
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,960
in oh I know the model is not perfect

422
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,359
and we all know model won't be perfect

423
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,400
but some works and then the good thing

424
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:45,678
is first our impression is not to check

425
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,559
all the lab note is to go back check our

426
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,400
database really pull out what's the GPS

427
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:53,798
information for that particular region

428
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,280
and then what's the corresponding raw

429
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:59,279
image look like and that's exactly we

430
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,639
show on the left side that's a raw image

431
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,798
and then we have this model inference

432
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:08,120
result on the right and we identify oh

433
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:10,720
there is a very very small portion being

434
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:14,079
labeled as jrv

435
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,159
infection as here and I hope the the

436
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:19,759
contrast is enough but we kind of zoom

437
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:21,880
in this region and really bring to

438
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,480
people and we confirm yes that's a

439
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,400
radish symptoms on grein Leaf so we

440
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,519
confirm there is

441
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,519
GV or can of grv infection symptom there

442
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,839
so that really give us the confidence

443
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,720
okay not only about the accuracy

444
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,720
absolute accuracy but also the way how

445
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,200
we think and how we retrieve the

446
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,200
information that we think might be a

447
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,480
surprise to our research

448
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,360
hypothesis and that's where this robot

449
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,440
can do

450
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:57,158
now so then uh we can of uh distribute

451
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:00,159
the ppb uh into different regions and

452
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:03,000
this is supported actually by the um s

453
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:05,520
Grand called vites gen 3 the third

454
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,119
generation uh and we have collaborators

455
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:11,319
all the way from California South Dakota

456
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:13,399
Wisconsin and Wisconsin Minnesota uh

457
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:16,439
West Virginia and of course New York we

458
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,480
have KY crew uh program we have madis

459
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,919
group uh program on group breeding and

460
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:26,839
also uh L program from the ARs

461
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:29,640
perspective um and then what we kind of

462
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:32,038
wondering is okay so we have these good

463
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,799
tools for our researchers and many of

464
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:36,359
them can afford that for sure right and

465
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,558
and we don't need to worry I mean the

466
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,319
only thing we need to AR is when we

467
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,000
going to start to get these agencies

468
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,038
back to function normally and we can

469
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,880
write Grand proposals and start to

470
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,759
acquire these tools for our research

471
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,880
routine research um but for gers the

472
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:55,279
challenge is always being around the

473
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,840
cost and also their return on investment

474
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:01,678
and for each of the PBB prototype uh

475
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:04,519
roughly just the building itself cost

476
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,519
$35,000 right and if you consider for an

477
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:11,000
entrepreneur to survive you need to at

478
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,960
least double that so each venor need to

479
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,519
pay for

480
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,278
$70,000 to get one

481
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:20,038
rubot I'm not sure when they can justify

482
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:22,400
the ri on their Finance balance sheet

483
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:25,599
right um but of course I don't want to

484
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,840
be the one to create further

485
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,798
disparity because of the technology

486
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,558
advancement that not how we've been

487
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:34,519
passionate about technology advancement

488
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:37,879
so that's a reason we just do some kind

489
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:40,480
of a brief comparison uh am of UR in

490
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,440
different states and we found okay

491
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,839
remote sensing is the only viable option

492
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,840
right because we have the federal

493
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,319
agencies like NASA to really offer

494
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:54,959
affordable or even free satellite

495
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:57,439
imageries that people can use and also

496
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,960
we have some other private sectors that

497
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,320
launch commercial satellites that will F

498
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,640
ultimately enable such of the thing

499
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:08,798
happening using remote sensing

500
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,520
technology but the question is how right

501
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,679
so when you consider the current remote

502
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:17,038
sensing can work largely is on one hand

503
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,080
we need to gather data from the air and

504
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,599
on the other hand we need to have the

505
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:23,639
so-called ground troops right so that

506
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,678
they can really build the model to

507
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,360
correlate the signals from your remote

508
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,880
sensing data set versus what we observed

509
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:33,798
from from the field and later on we can

510
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,159
translate or dispatch this model for the

511
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:38,960
actual uses but often times getting the

512
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,320
remote sensing data is no longer being

513
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,319
the challenge at least with all this

514
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:48,918
engineering advancement but who will be

515
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:51,000
the human power get the ground Tru

516
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:54,200
mement from the

517
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,319
field right you all run your field

518
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,558
experiments and I being very lucky have

519
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:03,079
my colleagues like kitty to run that I

520
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:04,960
know they have you know group of folks

521
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:06,399
just dedicated for ground choosing is

522
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,159
very tedious

523
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,080
laborers and no one really I wouldn't

524
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:13,400
say not really enjoy but when you

525
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:16,720
repetitively doing that then that's

526
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,798
where Bing starts right so our idea is

527
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,319
why not we can leverage our ground robot

528
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:24,960
as a source to ground troose what

529
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,960
happening on the ground and feed this

530
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,440
ground Tru data back to the satellite so

531
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,159
that we can build a model between the

532
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,919
robot generated ground tools versus the

533
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:39,600
satellite imagery so that we can have a

534
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,640
model but with a much affordable cost or

535
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:46,079
press tag to build

536
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:49,240
it so here is what we kind of TR um

537
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:52,079
actually last season is first we deploy

538
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,038
the robot in the vard right and as we

539
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,639
demonstrated there we can identify

540
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:58,798
different disease and generate a

541
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:02,240
geospatial map with what's their severe

542
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:05,359
there and instead of just having human

543
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,038
ground choosing we purely rely on this

544
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,678
map as the ground Cho because we know

545
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:13,119
the accuracy is pretty high and we can

546
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,840
confidently trust it and then we just

547
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:18,079
collect the Jone data or aircraft

548
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,038
hyperspectra data actually later on and

549
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,720
then we build a model try to see whether

550
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:27,079
or not we can use the rubot generated

551
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:30,640
ground TRS to train a model to interpret

552
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:32,398
the uev or remote sensing imagery into

553
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,640
disease

554
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:38,359
severity and here is what we got um the

555
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,559
first case is actually again a a

556
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:44,639
research vity in every teag and we use

557
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:47,000
the uev which has much higher uh special

558
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,200
resolution but um we use multispectral

559
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,480
Imaging which we have less spectral

560
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,600
information and what we found is

561
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,319
actually when the can of disease

562
00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:00,439
approaching to is a peak time or end

563
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:03,798
time the accuracy or the correlation

564
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,399
between the human uh the rubot generated

565
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:09,200
ground Truth versus the uh remote

566
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:12,000
sensing or U signal is really high and

567
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,159
we can push for a model of accuracy

568
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,278
about 80% that would be really useful

569
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:22,480
because you don't need to really rely on

570
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:24,679
kind of a um very time consuming human

571
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,759
scouting in the field you can actually

572
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:30,360
bro this um model and then just fly the

573
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:34,119
Drone with the hope we can deliver 80%

574
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:36,879
accuracy quote unquote um so that the G

575
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:40,319
can really use a faster speed to know

576
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,919
what is happening in the field right but

577
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,319
we all know what is kind of not really

578
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:48,278
good for multispectral Imaging is it

579
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:51,079
lacks of certain spectral resolution

580
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:53,880
that can really resolve the signal

581
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,359
relevant to the disease infection or the

582
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,799
disease

583
00:25:55,359 --> 00:26:00,199
itself so that's the reason we Leverage

584
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:02,879
The hyp spectral technology um but

585
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,080
before we kind of getting into build a

586
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,000
model what we do is first as a data

587
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:12,079
person I really want to have a very

588
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
solid statistic evidence to show yes the

589
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,319
DAT based on the data intrinsics they

590
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,839
are separable so what we do is we use

591
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:23,798
both human field scouting as a ground

592
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:26,839
troose and also rubot field scouting at

593
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:30,519
the ground shoose and then we label all

594
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:32,798
the pixels from the REM sensing data set

595
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:36,639
and try to see what's the separation

596
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:40,000
power between healthy and infected

597
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,000
plants and what we found is actually the

598
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,359
rubot is not only on par but actually

599
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,960
give a little bit more statistical power

600
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:51,839
in generating the separation between

601
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,519
healthy and infected plants through the

602
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,359
hyperspectral data okay to me that's a

603
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,398
really kind of exciting thing because

604
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:59,599
then we have the solid foundation to

605
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:01,918
build a

606
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,359
model and here is just a you know

607
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,440
highlight of that particular region and

608
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:10,079
you can see for the human the mean to

609
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,798
mean is almost very close to each other

610
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,079
and if you consider the standard

611
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:16,519
deviation that just created a challenge

612
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:19,038
for the modeling itself but when you

613
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:21,240
look at the bottom part that's where the

614
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:24,038
ground truth is from the rubot you start

615
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,240
to see clear kind of a separation even

616
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:28,319
between the two

617
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,599
means so that that give us additional

618
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,599
power to believe the model should get

619
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,919
improved so with that we just build the

620
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:41,240
model and uh of course uh we can of a

621
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:45,519
tested out on that hyperspectral imagery

622
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,640
uh collected by the aircraft uh and 5%

623
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,359
Improvement um so we are still kind of

624
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,960
waiting for more data for from the

625
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:55,839
coming season and try to see if this is

626
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,798
a solid 5% Improvement or it could be

627
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,879
just a variation by Nature right and it

628
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:02,079
is hard to tell at this point but at

629
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:06,360
least give us a very prom missing

630
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:09,079
results from the data analytics

631
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:11,558
perspective and of course you know with

632
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:13,720
that as we kind of uh discussed what's

633
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:16,798
the motivation there right is really to

634
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:20,120
have a skillable solution that everyone

635
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:22,759
can afford to use Advanced Technologies

636
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:25,158
and that's the comparison very easy okay

637
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:28,119
a group of four to five people do the

638
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:31,399
human scouting for this venard that's

639
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:34,518
actually a venard out in California um

640
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:36,439
takes a week and with the rubot we need

641
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,599
several hours to run the rubot

642
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,840
autonomously there I mean although you

643
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:44,158
don't need to think oh I don't need to

644
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:47,359
Traverse there how much power robot can

645
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,600
consume based on the current regulatory

646
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:52,719
in California and actually most of the

647
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:56,519
states in the US you need to follow the

648
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,319
self-driven car traffic policy for

649
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,200
having autonomous robot running in your

650
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:04,038
field

651
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,120
that's I did not get understand about

652
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:09,038
that part but that's what we've been

653
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:11,038
regulated okay so I have brought that up

654
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,519
to actually many of the New York

655
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,798
legislator lators and hopefully they

656
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,240
start to discuss what would be the

657
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:21,599
policy from New York to really Embrace

658
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,038
this technology and being like aead of

659
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,359
other states or even the world about

660
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:28,759
this new regulatories for autonomous

661
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:30,639
equipment in agriculture

662
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:33,839
and last is actually the the NASA

663
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,960
average you know data acquisition just

664
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,278
the whole

665
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,120
region and then it take seven minutes to

666
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:43,278
run the model yes you get it okay so

667
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,558
that's really the difference in terms of

668
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,798
how soon we can get and how large the

669
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:50,240
region we can cover in terms of using

670
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:52,278
remote sensing plus with all these rout

671
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,399
Technologies

672
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:57,640
together so up to this point I would say

673
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:58,558
okay we have the autonomous disease

674
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,919
scouting

675
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,480
uh we have the disease detection models

676
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:05,519
by supervisor learning so if you work on

677
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,079
machine learning this is the way like a

678
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:11,480
human need to explicitly tell the answer

679
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:14,519
what this is to the model so the model

680
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,679
can learn what it is okay the pen is

681
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:20,278
like we need human labels and I know

682
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:22,120
many of you don't want to do that um and

683
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:24,679
then we have a proof of concept

684
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:27,639
skillable scouting from the field to the

685
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:30,600
region levels through this ground to

686
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,480
Arrow branch of this close loop

687
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,639
analysis but what is missing there right

688
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,120
is actually looking at this map that's

689
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,038
how we distribute our rubot across the

690
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:42,239
country is actually the model

691
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:45,119
generalized capability which is also a

692
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,200
key for many of these AI research is the

693
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,959
model train on one data set whether or

694
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,360
not I can rely on for many of unseen

695
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,679
data sets in the

696
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:58,000
future and what we did is okay instead

697
00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:00,720
of just rely on the image itself which

698
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,599
give us the V feature we leverage the

699
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,519
multimodal models so we use the language

700
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:08,638
as a

701
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,638
regulator because that's how many of us

702
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:12,199
as a human pathologies really kind of

703
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:15,038
communicating because I'm learning from

704
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:18,159
you and I'm not kind of learning from

705
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:21,079
you to point all the pixels on the

706
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,159
images seeing hey that's the PO M

707
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:26,119
infection that's Don M infection that's

708
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:29,840
your RV I've been told just when you

709
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:33,158
look at the p m that's a widish layer on

710
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:35,558
top of the leaf and you need an acute

711
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:38,278
angle to look at that so you can really

712
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:40,678
see it clearly that's how we really

713
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:43,440
learn and that's what we really want to

714
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,480
push for AI technology is why not to use

715
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,038
text description as a way to tell the

716
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,880
model what is the feature looks like in

717
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:54,398
the image so that combining both the

718
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,639
image as a v inputs and the text as

719
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,479
another inputs the model actually can

720
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:02,599
get better performance

721
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,278
so here is just a quick thing to show um

722
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:08,678
with this improvements U we got a much

723
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:11,798
higher accuracy as compare with uh the

724
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:13,639
Baseline model in the middle and also

725
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:15,599
another kind of a large foundational

726
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:18,439
model called Sam I think many of you

727
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,879
also use that maybe um so get some

728
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,120
improvements there so that really

729
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,159
demonstrate yes our hypothesis is

730
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:27,000
correct and when you try to use

731
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,639
additional modality or the modality

732
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,720
information and the overall model

733
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:33,839
performance will be boosted because the

734
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,159
model is really trying to learn some of

735
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,439
the knowledge rather than the

736
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:40,720
superficial you know pixel

737
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,159
relationships so then what we want to

738
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,079
test is not just for the New York right

739
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:47,480
um we talk about the model generalized

740
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:50,359
capability and that's our Target what

741
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,759
about we just pick one data set from

742
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:54,678
California and this is the totally un

743
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:57,158
that that we have no idea what's going

744
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:59,038
on and if you look at all these images

745
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:01,320
the even us using different scoring

746
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,398
system than what we use in New York

747
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,879
their training system is different and

748
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:08,759
you see each group one is a very buy

749
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,679
canopy and being very well separated as

750
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:14,879
compare as a panel like a whole panel of

751
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,320
leaves in New York right and how the

752
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,639
model going to

753
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,319
perform that's the first thing we got

754
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:24,558
just a deros shot which means we TR our

755
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:27,278
model only using the New York data set

756
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:30,398
done modeling part is done and we

757
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:33,558
directly Ed that model infer the disease

758
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,398
infection on the California data sets

759
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:40,038
and that's what we found actually across

760
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:42,000
two years from 23 and 24 so this is the

761
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:44,599
error distribution remember they have

762
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,398
the scoring system from zero to six

763
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:49,599
right a z to five six different levels

764
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:51,959
and in the middle line that's agreement

765
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,079
with no scaring category difference at

766
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,319
all and then when you look at the

767
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:59,240
overall distribution maximum difference

768
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:03,240
category IAL difference would be just a

769
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:05,319
one level either minus one or plus one

770
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,679
and this is very consistent through two

771
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:10,639
years of this testing and we are very

772
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,918
happy about that um so that demonstrate

773
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,440
okay these models are generalizable but

774
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:18,960
what's the next is actually Several Hard

775
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,878
Times get ready so the first thing we

776
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,838
are kind of thinking is at the beginning

777
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,598
from the project people are more

778
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:27,759
interested in or concerning whether or

779
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,240
not the rubot can detect very low

780
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,679
incident cases right because they are

781
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,678
very challenging for Compu Vision but

782
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,200
what we found actually from the C

783
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,800
California data set is no actually the

784
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,158
model handle those low incidence cases

785
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,679
pretty good I would see but more

786
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,760
problematic with high incidence and this

787
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,519
is understandable because for many of

788
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,560
the Breeders or even PL pathologist

789
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:55,119
after certain stret cold you g just see

790
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:56,960
no that's a useless thing I got just

791
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,280
give whatever score there right

792
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:04,559
regardless that

793
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:07,320
really 55% or 75% or 95% I all call them

794
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:10,000
score five right so that really being

795
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,240
the key challenge um but is actually

796
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,960
good thing because our model actually

797
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:17,078
give better percentage quantification

798
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,440
rather than just a

799
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:22,480
scaring the second aha moment is okay

800
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,639
now we have really disease progression

801
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,920
right is as I mentioned it's not just a

802
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,279
single time point we can frequently

803
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:32,159
deploy that on weekly basis and we can

804
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,800
generate this disease progression curve

805
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:37,598
and as a data scientist I'm lazy right

806
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,039
and I lack of the be honest yeah and I

807
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,800
lack of certain PL pathology knowledge

808
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:44,239
so what I do is really from the data

809
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,640
perspective that's just a WR clustering

810
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:49,759
algorithm and see what we can learn from

811
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:52,159
these disease Progressive curves and

812
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,200
very surprising we found a can cluster

813
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:58,199
if you see starting with adding uh four

814
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:01,239
clusters there there is a bottom Blue

815
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:04,399
Line showing consistently very low

816
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:06,439
disease infection symptoms there right

817
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,720
so from the breeding perspective that's

818
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,240
exactly the group we want to identify

819
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:14,039
because they really give a very strong

820
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:16,000
resistance to the disease in the natural

821
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:18,639
environment and that's what we really

822
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,920
want to kind of um find using big data

823
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,719
right because then breeding is a number

824
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,318
game in my opining the more numbers we

825
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:28,199
put in the the kind of higher likelihood

826
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:30,559
we're going to get something useful

827
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:32,799
and this is really enable us to put more

828
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,719
and more and more numbers there and to

829
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,680
really enhance our possibility of

830
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:40,159
getting the right materials for

831
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:43,679
different environment or different

832
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:46,920
desires aha moment three is

833
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:49,199
actually okay so we compare right we

834
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,920
have this progression curve but how that

835
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:55,039
can of compare among different years so

836
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,358
what we usually kind of expect is

837
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:00,279
actually the left side right if it this

838
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:03,880
is the genotype with certain disease

839
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,160
resistant genes kind of stacked there we

840
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,200
expect it demonstrate also high

841
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,920
resistance to any of the pathogen like

842
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:12,679
for example this is for po M right but

843
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,920
actually through the data analysis we

844
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:18,078
found the right side

845
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:22,280
case that particular genotype also have

846
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:25,280
a stack of resistant genes but the why

847
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:28,760
in one year is behave very normal right

848
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,800
if you look at the um blue and red lines

849
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:34,240
that's actually the data from 23 but

850
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,920
when you look at the uh black lines

851
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:40,838
that's the data from 24 it got kind of

852
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,760
infected a lot by par

853
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:45,279
muu right and that really give us a new

854
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,000
science question what

855
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,760
happened that's a part bring back this

856
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,239
chart right so we discussed about all

857
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,319
the plan environment management but what

858
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:58,118
we lack is what's the interaction from

859
00:37:56,318 --> 00:38:00,960
the pathogen

860
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,599
point of view right there are so many

861
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,519
isolate and we know the mutant risk is

862
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,760
very high for this m BS right and how

863
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:13,358
that being considered so far in the

864
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,800
whole breeding cycle or whole management

865
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:18,119
cycle and now our new tools really

866
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,760
enable us to do that and actually that

867
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,240
right case if you look at here is kind

868
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:27,760
of overcome by a specific isolate of

869
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:30,959
ping modu only identified in California

870
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:35,079
not in New York okay but it might be a

871
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:37,760
matter of time when it can't be here so

872
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:40,160
with that um we have some new chapters

873
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,560
to ongoing right we have affordable

874
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:46,838
scalable solution especially now we want

875
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:49,239
to bridge the the the um closed loop

876
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:52,159
from the arrow to the ground right rubot

877
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:54,598
are very neat but they are so expensive

878
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,679
and how to strategically deploy them

879
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:59,079
into different places that can help the

880
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:01,598
remote sensing model even being better

881
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:04,640
than nowadays so that's our next

882
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:07,519
question and also is a economic question

883
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:10,519
now this actx sector being soly focused

884
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:13,000
in California which I understand why but

885
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:14,358
is this the right way to allocate all

886
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,199
the resources

887
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:20,400
there and how to strategically really

888
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:23,078
expand and reallocate these resources

889
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,240
both help the gers to combat their

890
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,760
production kind of challenges but also

891
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:30,199
help these startup companies gain

892
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,440
economic benefits and hopefully that can

893
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:34,919
also boost Regional economy because of

894
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,119
the Technology

895
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,358
Innovation and then of course with this

896
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,280
new approach we start to add passing

897
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,358
back in the whole thing right then we

898
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,000
really have four components there try to

899
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:49,119
identify their complex relationships and

900
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,280
we hope to review more and the last part

901
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:55,760
is a um participatory research approach

902
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,440
uh we talk about this Hightech but my

903
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,680
heart goes with people and where we are

904
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,119
right now and that's actually ongoing

905
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:05,399
effort from my student supported by NASA

906
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,079
we call it the pharmacology Network and

907
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,639
basically is if everyone doesn't matter

908
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,599
if you are a grer or not can contribute

909
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:16,679
a cell phone image with a specific

910
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,880
guidance that would allow us to build AI

911
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:21,559
models to better understand Regional

912
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,920
level thing without much of a pressure

913
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:27,920
lacking of data um so I hope to share

914
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,920
more maybe in the coming years or two um

915
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,079
but so far everyone we reach out is very

916
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,599
excited about this approach because they

917
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:38,160
now feel being part of Agriculture

918
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,838
rather than oh yeah I'm just a buyer of

919
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,598
the Agricultural

920
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,318
produces period right so if you are part

921
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,318
of something then you start to generate

922
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:49,358
the different motivation and passion so

923
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:51,639
with that i g to acknowledge for all

924
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,480
these funding agencies programs to

925
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:56,118
really support all this wonderful work

926
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,760
and also thank everyone in actually the

927
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:00,358
beginning you know

928
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,319
from the four Labs who you know made

929
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:04,920
significant contributions otherwise I

930
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,679
won't give the talk here today with that

931
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,480
I hope I still have some time to take

932
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:11,118
questions

933
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,280
thanks

934
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,119
yeah I was just curious um you said said

935
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,079
that the robot was around

936
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:21,559
$35,000 now I think did you compare with

937
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:25,400
how much it costs for the ground TR by

938
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:25,400
humans what does it cost for

939
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,719
that so

940
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:35,760
the the question is um the rubot cost

941
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:38,000
$35,000 uh and what's the cost for human

942
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,400
Scouting For the equivalent coverage

943
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,920
right and

944
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:45,519
accuracy that's a great question and we

945
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,519
did not really do a very precise

946
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:51,440
calculation on that kind of a category

947
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:53,800
because largely we tested mostly for the

948
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,559
research venur and that's being paid by

949
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,640
K's program I'm not sure how much

950
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:00,519
dollars you put for that but I guess

951
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:02,920
that's a kind of significant portion of

952
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:05,800
your program right being hired people

953
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:09,159
and doing that so I would consider rubot

954
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,800
still might be cheaper right might be

955
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:13,759
cheaper in my opinion but again

956
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,200
technology itself the rubot itself is

957
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,760
there right but so far we need the

958
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:22,000
operator to learn what is

959
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,839
Linux um how many of you use Linux on

960
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,880
daily

961
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,799
basis right yeah okay I I saw several

962
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,358
people and there are some kind of a

963
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,839
troubleshooting skills we need for the

964
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:35,920
operator right if what what if something

965
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,558
happen and and how you can really

966
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,519
quickly put the robot back in function

967
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:43,880
so those are steep learning maybe not

968
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:46,838
steep but at least some learning curves

969
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,838
there to prepare a new Workforce and

970
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:50,880
that's the reason why through my

971
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:54,279
extension actually we put a lot of

972
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,200
efforts now try to um distribute needed

973
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,960
training materials for the gers but at

974
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:01,919
the same time working with different

975
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,760
sectors try to lever or um create the

976
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,358
Synergy to build the new Workforce

977
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,839
Development programs especially you know

978
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:10,279
with Cornell as a so unique position

979
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:13,119
with all of these

980
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,839
aspects did the math real quick so for

981
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,119
just the training data for the whole

982
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:20,519
season it was approximately $112,000 for

983
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,800
like sub one acre so as soon as you're

984
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:25,759
using the robot in its current condition

985
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,000
over three acres you're

986
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,200
netting POS

987
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,199
and that doesn't count like

988
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:38,960
indirect oh yes was

989
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,160
better a followup question to bills

990
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,519
about cost of the robot it also relates

991
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:47,078
to resolution of the

992
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:49,400
satellite and relates also to like the

993
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:51,960
potential of the imaging technology

994
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,000
Precision agiculture so unless I'm

995
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,838
mistaken a lot of Growers are in their

996
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,358
fields on regular basis driving their

997
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:59,960
equipment how much of the cost of the

998
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:04,480
robot is

999
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:07,280
navigation right and relative to image

1000
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,039
acquisition data analysis take the guts

1001
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,240
of the robot and put it on the tractor

1002
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:14,119
right and make something and is the

1003
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,239
image analysis fast it's just a

1004
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:18,160
realistic goal so that you put it on the

1005
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:19,558
front of the tractor and the images are

1006
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:23,639
analyzed by the time the back of the

1007
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,640
tractor passes then this nozzle comes on

1008
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,920
off so let me summarize your question is

1009
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,119
like how about to translate some

1010
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,358
components from the current rubot

1011
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:37,119
prototype into the existing agricultural

1012
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:39,440
machineries so that we can lower down

1013
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,240
the operation cost while still taking

1014
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,838
advantage of all this advanced

1015
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:48,279
technology right okay great and that's a

1016
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:50,358
great suggestion uh and I'm I agree with

1017
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,720
you 100% about that and I'm not sure if

1018
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:55,400
you notice when we distribute the the

1019
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:58,159
robots to different places we do not

1020
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:01,280
distribute the whole product type we

1021
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:03,759
actually take out the the Imaging kind

1022
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,000
of a component or model and really

1023
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,160
distribute that part because when we

1024
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,960
consider autonomous scouting right

1025
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,519
autonomous is one thing that's more like

1026
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:17,000
about navigation and people may not

1027
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:20,119
really enjoy or like need that like a

1028
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,960
$15,000 each navigation model but they

1029
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:25,680
much more like the you know $20,000

1030
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,760
Imaging model with analysis capacity

1031
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:30,879
right and I agree with you then we can

1032
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,319
attach to ATV tractor any of the egg

1033
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,440
equipment nowadays we can easily find in

1034
00:45:33,318 --> 00:45:37,679
the venard or alard or other kind of

1035
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,838
farms so that people can start to gain

1036
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:42,719
the benefits um one thing I want to kind

1037
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:45,480
of highlight is actually the the

1038
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,919
analysis power right or or the speed or

1039
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,039
turnaround time of getting the raw data

1040
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,760
to the result The Growers can use or

1041
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:56,079
researchers can use is getting much

1042
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:58,079
faster uh and my personal kind of a

1043
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,440
vision is to this thing is going to

1044
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,400
improve infinitely right and even for

1045
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,960
our current robot is running on a near

1046
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:09,039
real time term which means as soon as

1047
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,440
the camera taking one image the analysis

1048
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,599
model finish the inference at the same

1049
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,200
time and then you will just keep

1050
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:19,079
continue so at the end of the scanning

1051
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:22,039
of the robot we also start to have the

1052
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:23,800
map of the where the diseases are in

1053
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:26,440
that kind of a particular field and is

1054
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,640
all Geor referen so then back to our

1055
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,880
last point point that really kind of

1056
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:33,239
enable us for many of these preceding

1057
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,119
management practices right and then we

1058
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:38,759
can use for Target spray or even you

1059
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:40,960
know using the current fan base that

1060
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,119
that still cance a lot of chemicals

1061
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,318
which is also a concern right now but in

1062
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,838
the long run I would see having this

1063
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:50,679
rubar might also help us to manage the

1064
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:52,679
soil problems in the long run because

1065
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:55,399
the large egg equipment cause a lot of

1066
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:57,838
soil compaction and there is no kind of

1067
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,200
a good solution right that might be an

1068
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:03,039
additional motivation and also because

1069
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:05,480
of the cost if that's kind of a compact

1070
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:08,318
system Growers may just a share that

1071
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:10,480
unit and just load on their trailer and

1072
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:13,119
walk around so several people can just

1073
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,960
buy one rather than every of them will

1074
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,358
buy

1075
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:21,720
one yeah I hope I answer your question

1076
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:24,719
you more comprehensive with yeah um yeah

1077
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:27,199
yeah yes yes so are you able to

1078
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,118
differentiate different diseases

1079
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,799
great question that's a wonderful

1080
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:35,358
question um so at the beginning we

1081
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:38,318
solely focus on either Donnie or poy or

1082
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:41,318
gr and last year for that kind of

1083
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:44,239
sensitivity slice if you still remember

1084
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:47,199
rubot is better kind of identified a

1085
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:51,719
small spot that's a actually a mixture

1086
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:54,239
of Donnie and uh gr RV so we will be

1087
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:57,558
able to differentiate that but largely

1088
00:47:54,239 --> 00:48:00,639
my kind of personal opinion is is I

1089
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:03,599
really use human pathology as the

1090
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:05,279
standard what human can do let's don't

1091
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,160
really kind of consider more advanced

1092
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,839
sensing Technologies because that always

1093
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:13,920
give us advantages right but let's step

1094
00:48:10,838 --> 00:48:16,239
back you and I just have this naked eye

1095
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,358
just the you know uh for the visible

1096
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:22,039
range to see all these things in our

1097
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:24,199
world but with your knowledge you still

1098
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:27,079
still be able to differentiate a lot of

1099
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:30,199
these things and my current goal is how

1100
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:32,760
we can push rubas and AI to achieve that

1101
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:35,919
first and of course if we can achieve

1102
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,040
that with Advanced sensing modeles with

1103
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,838
additional information chain everything

1104
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:43,119
G to be just boost

1105
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:44,400
naturally I could as well so a lot of

1106
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,760
people from my group who spent a lot of

1107
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,240
time training a robot um in particular

1108
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,160
my field research manager da holes who's

1109
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:52,879
forgotten more about disease management

1110
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:56,239
that I think any of us would really hope

1111
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,640
to know um the robot the new model is

1112
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:01,078
just good at looking at its imagery as

1113
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,118
he is now so it's there's still room

1114
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,559
like you know him in the field P head

1115
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,000
like sticking his head in the vine like

1116
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:09,880
being there but like looking at the

1117
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,559
imagery they're CL I think that gets to

1118
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:15,079
use point where it's like the

1119
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,440
human you want to repeat that to the

1120
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:21,440
zoom audience oh yeah for for whom on

1121
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:24,679
Zoom what Kitty kind of add in is now

1122
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,480
the rubot is as good as

1123
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:30,279
her very longterm and a wonderful

1124
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,719
technician Dave come uh with like a 30

1125
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,760
years of experience about the disease in

1126
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,239
grip

1127
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:41,559
ones thanks so much for the

1128
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:43,239
comment oh um oh yes sorry I forgot that

1129
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:46,839
yeah yes and

1130
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:50,879
yes is the uh the ground Imaging

1131
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:53,519
dependent fair weather days or is it

1132
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,318
restricted by very bright days like post

1133
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,480
rain Bo overhead irrigation Two Face

1134
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:00,199
limits like that yeah the the the

1135
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,639
question is whether or not the robot

1136
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:05,879
being limited by environment conditions

1137
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:08,798
like the sunlight or varying you know U

1138
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:11,400
conditions so uh great question so far

1139
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:14,159
the only kind of enemy for the robot is

1140
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:17,440
the severe weather events like a very

1141
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:19,519
windy very snowy very rainy I cannot run

1142
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,559
that because nothing is you know

1143
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,519
weatherproof but other than that um so I

1144
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,240
did not introduce more on the sensing

1145
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:30,280
side but we use active illumination

1146
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:32,919
to combat the sunlight so the camera

1147
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,559
does not rely on the natural light to

1148
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:38,680
provide the information it's actually

1149
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:41,440
rely an artificial light so that only

1150
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:44,078
that light provide the illumination and

1151
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,200
that's how we really uh try to control

1152
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,480
the data quality consistency and

1153
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:51,239
actually also boost the AI model for the

1154
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,199
generalized capability so it serves for

1155
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:58,679
both purpose and it can run day and

1156
00:50:54,199 --> 00:51:01,439
night yes yeah U my question was about

1157
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:03,078
what powers the robot and like it's a

1158
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,599
charge like how long can it go without

1159
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:06,920
beting a charge like I'm thinking if

1160
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,400
it's in the middle of a Vineyard it

1161
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:12,480
might be hard to go back and and charge

1162
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,960
it so yeah so the question is uh about

1163
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,719
the B battery consumption or the power

1164
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:20,838
consumption and charging time for the

1165
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:23,798
robot um so so far for the robot it can

1166
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:26,400
constantly run about three hours for one

1167
00:51:23,798 --> 00:51:29,400
charge and usually we feel that's kind

1168
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,519
of sufficient to cover he is two acres

1169
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:35,400
field per charge um but of course you

1170
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:37,239
know we are upgrading all the platform

1171
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,440
and with the Improv The Battery

1172
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:41,519
Technology and I know at Cornell we have

1173
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,880
a lot of researchers on you know energy

1174
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,280
side we hope actually to further improve

1175
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,280
that down the

1176
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,280
row

1177
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:56,798
yes oh oh I miss that let me open that

1178
00:51:54,039 --> 00:52:00,639
oh there are several messages on the

1179
00:51:56,798 --> 00:52:02,679
zoom sorry folks just open that um first

1180
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,440
comment from Gary very exciting PR

1181
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:07,759
missing research well communicated

1182
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:11,318
thanks thanks Gary for you

1183
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,920
um second from Edwin uh I'm wondering

1184
00:52:11,318 --> 00:52:18,199
what is the maximum height that robot

1185
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:21,440
can extend can it work on hops up to six

1186
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:25,239
six meter tall um so add that's a great

1187
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,798
question so so far so it's not on this

1188
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:29,078
kind of a rubot based platform platform

1189
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:31,318
we have a new one and that one can be

1190
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:33,160
used for apples um although for a

1191
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:35,039
different purpose not for disease at the

1192
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:37,239
moment it's more like for its 3D

1193
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:41,639
structure um for the digital twin

1194
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:43,439
purpose um so I would say six Metter

1195
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:44,639
might be okay it depends on the base

1196
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,000
right everything is down to the

1197
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:50,199
mechanical designing whether or not it's

1198
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,719
stable and also a challenge for New York

1199
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:57,318
forever is our kind of um terrain

1200
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:59,679
situation uh if that's in our Washington

1201
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:01,759
California with a super flat field I

1202
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,919
would see oh yeah let's just do that but

1203
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,960
now with New York we have all these

1204
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,400
slopes D all these things um I I think

1205
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,199
it's kind of a very Case by case at this

1206
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,960
moment but I I think in general six

1207
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:18,118
meter would be okay yeah hope to answer

1208
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:20,599
your question um next from Luke do you

1209
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:23,000
think it will be on the individual

1210
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:25,960
farmer to buy into this remote sensing

1211
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,039
technology to use it or do you foresee

1212
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:30,519
that there will be a subscription

1213
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:33,440
service perhaps where a company will

1214
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:35,920
have a fleet of drones Rovers sensors

1215
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:39,119
extra and be able to work with Farmers

1216
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,519
to do the data capture to data

1217
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:44,079
processing uh and make recommendations

1218
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:47,280
on decision making uh one for question

1219
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:50,039
look so that's also my feeling uh I I

1220
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,839
don't really have a very strong opinion

1221
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:55,199
either way you know um but I think both

1222
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:57,719
can work and I see definitely both work

1223
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:00,358
because for many of the pilot Growers

1224
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:02,879
who kind of run very large vure generate

1225
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:05,440
tons of the revenues their only question

1226
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,559
is how I can maintain that right by

1227
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,159
saving money that that's their kind of a

1228
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:12,319
first priority and I wouldn't see they

1229
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:14,519
would be hesitated if this is the proved

1230
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:17,079
technology they going to invest on that

1231
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:19,559
and then really use that on daily basis

1232
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:22,079
but of course then down to small to

1233
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:24,920
mediumsized Farmers that's a totally

1234
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:28,839
different word and sometimes even asking

1235
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:31,400
for you know $500 subscription fee can

1236
00:54:28,838 --> 00:54:33,558
be a glitchy question there right so I

1237
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,160
definitely foresee both business model

1238
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:38,119
could wrong and I think the best way is

1239
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,759
let's just explore and see how these

1240
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:43,039
things go naturally um because in my

1241
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:46,760
opinion what we bring in for this Clos

1242
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:49,679
Loop um framework is to let the pilot

1243
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:52,799
and the large GRS to actually help the

1244
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:54,838
small to medium siiz Farmers because

1245
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:56,838
largely the training data set going to

1246
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:58,880
be contributed by them

1247
00:54:56,838 --> 00:55:01,558
and then the knowledge can be translated

1248
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,000
to the other group who might not be able

1249
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:09,400
to afford this advanced technology at

1250
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,039
the moment okay um last from Don hi you

1251
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:14,358
for virus detection the best use for

1252
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:16,519
remote sensing might be in the nursery

1253
00:55:14,358 --> 00:55:18,920
do you have any plans to use the robot

1254
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:22,000
or Imaging models in a commercial grip

1255
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:24,039
Nursery wonderful question uh Donna uh

1256
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,400
maybe you can just shoot me an email

1257
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:29,960
let's just chat after this seminar um

1258
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:34,559
sounds like a very interesting use case

1259
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,559
scenario yeah that's what I got from

1260
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:38,318
Zoom all right thanks

1261
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:49,480
