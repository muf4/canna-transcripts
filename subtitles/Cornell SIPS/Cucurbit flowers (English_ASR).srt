00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,960
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:08,279
University hi everyone my name is keny

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,800
Rodriguez I am a PhD student at Corell

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,518
University and today I'm here with Steve

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,200
rers he's a Horticulture specialist and

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,278
today we're talking about we're going to

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,640
be talking about flowering on curbit so

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:22,879
Steve sometimes people wonder if there

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,560
are like females and male plants that we

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,079
need to plant in order to get

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,278
pollenization and to get fruit or

12
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,479
sometimes people don't get u fruit in

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,238
their plants so can you talk us a little

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,480
bit about that and how does the

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:38,320
flowering influence um the fruit

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,479
producing in the Cur beads sure and

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,359
curbit they're different than a lot of

18
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,439
other things for example tomatoes have

19
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,439
what we call perfect flowers flowers

20
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:48,920
have both male and female parts within

21
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,000
within a single flower in curbit and

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,760
we're talking squash and pumpkins and

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,480
cucumbers and melons um with those they

24
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,238
have male and female flowers and we have

25
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,358
a perfect example of it right here in

26
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,959
this plant right next to each other for

27
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,560
example so here this is going to be a

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,599
male flower easy to tell because if you

29
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,560
look at the base of the flower there's

30
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,599
no immature fruit on that as compared to

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,519
this right next to it you can see here's

32
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,079
a flower and then you can see this

33
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,679
immature fruit you can notice the

34
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,640
difference between these two so we've

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,479
got male flowers we got the female

36
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,200
flowers and here's another female flower

37
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,000
here that's even a little bit further

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,200
along and that flower is just opening up

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,959
now the male flowers typically there's

40
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,118
going to be maybe 10 or 12

41
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,359
um in a season for every one single

42
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,759
female flow that we're going to get and

43
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,560
the male flour and I'm going to just

44
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,359
pull this one off I'm going to open it

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,118
up because there could be a pollinator

46
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:44,319
in there sometimes there are but there's

47
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,799
not in here but again this is where the

48
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,000
pollen is and bees and other pollinators

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,680
will go into that flower they're going

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,239
to actually they're going for some

51
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,000
nectar that's at the bottom of that

52
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,078
flower but they're also getting some of

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
the pollen as well and as they're in

54
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,919
there they get that pollen all over

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,118
themselves and then they go to a female

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,399
flower like what we will have here and

57
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:06,879
you can see here and then they're

58
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,878
bringing that the pollen onto the sticky

59
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,560
part the stigma of the female flower

60
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,840
which is what what's right up there at

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,280
top and moving that pollen over that

62
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,680
gives us fruit set if for some reason we

63
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,640
don't have bees M now there could be

64
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,480
bees but maybe it's been a week of rainy

65
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,119
weather or it's been really hot if you

66
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,479
don't have the bees moving from the male

67
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,239
flowers to the female flowers what can

68
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,799
happen is eventually um this will start

69
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,439
to get a little B bigger but because you

70
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,160
didn't have any pollen move you didn't

71
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:37,039
have fruits it eventually this will

72
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,680
yellow and just fall right off so people

73
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,439
sometimes will panic when they see these

74
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,719
and they they see these open and then

75
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,598
they don't see any fruit and that's

76
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:45,598
normal it's a male flower if you're

77
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,238
seeing these opening up and these are

78
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,280
falling off and again you look for that

79
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,480
immature fruit um then you you could

80
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,199
potentially have a problem so do all

81
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:59,000
plants Dan have female male FL

82
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,799
flowers um all curbit yes all curbit for

83
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,919
the most part would be exceptions

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,719
because some are have only female

85
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,639
flowers and we have to put some other

86
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,878
plants out there pollinators is what we

87
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,279
call them because they'll have male

88
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:12,719
flowers um so if we just had a feel of

89
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,759
nothing but female flowers we wouldn't

90
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,719
really get anything this has been a

91
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:21,759
