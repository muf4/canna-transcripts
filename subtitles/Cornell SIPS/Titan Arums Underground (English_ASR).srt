1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,759
University

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,640
justed now we're going to find out if

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
it's going to go down easy or hard

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,640
yeah yep all

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,640
right

7
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,279
fingers it down yeah maybe that would

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,320
make more

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,160
sense if you want to have a look in

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,840
there you can see the old where the this

11
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,718
is how big the leaf to give you some

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,239
idea that's how big the leaf was and so

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,439
you're seeing in there is basically

14
00:00:55,238 --> 00:01:00,640
that's the the actual corn right there

15
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,280
and uh I don't see any bud coming up yet

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,920
which which is a good sign that probably

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,359
means this will be a little dormant a

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,400
little bit longer suck on Roots there

19
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:12,438
yeah well and that's a good definitely a

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,280
lot yeah yeah okay all well I'm going to

21
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:15,279
so get a

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,879
Legge that sounds like a good

23
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:35,719
one oh look at this we found buried in

24
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:38,478
here I was this is really cool so I I

25
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:41,959
had feared this was lost it it had gone

26
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:44,039
into the pot we planted this on August

27
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:47,759
11th

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,960
2013 uh and it was weighed on June 1st

29
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,438
of 2013 and it weighed 18 lbs uh which

30
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,038
is very good because I'm expecting this

31
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:59,519
to weigh a lot more based on how big the

32
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,519
air was

33
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,519
get on the song got

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,718
it

35
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,598
okay there is

36
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:13,199
excitement

37
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,199
wow almost feel like an

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
archaeologist what blow baffles me is so

39
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:21,120
what do you think did all that media

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,280
just s of weak out through the botom the

41
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,599
pretty compressed yeah that must yeah

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,400
that's pretty

43
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:31,439
true I think this could weigh more than

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,120
the other one I mean this is a m cor and

45
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,919
we have a good scale downstairs that

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,360
Andy and I tested yesterday

47
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:42,919
that on from the top The Roots come from

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,879
the top of the Corn and uh and then they

49
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:47,598
go around it and go down and grow around

50
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,439
the cor as the cor gets converted to

51
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,878
energy for the for the plants they

52
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:54,079
necessary plant them several inches down

53
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:54,919
because if you don't The Roots will sort

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,519
of go

55
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:59,679
up be out of the soil

56
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,800
which pretty soon I think we can flip it

57
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,800
over

58
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,800
yeah

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,640
yeah you know this may not so my punch

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,000
actually is that this may not be a

61
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,279
flower because do you see buds are the

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,878
bud is on the periphery which may mean

63
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,439
that this won't flower which is good and

64
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,798
bad it's good

65
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:28,759
because when it does flower it'll be a

66
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,599
really good a huge specimen because I

67
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,039
I'm

68
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,399
yeah I I'm going to guess that this

69
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,598
weighs about 50

70
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,719
lb you see all these roots that are

71
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,639
coming off the top of the corner yeah

72
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,759
that's really good that's a good

73
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,679
observation but I mean I'm actually

74
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,239
really really pleased is the help of

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,079
this you know it's always you're never

76
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:55,640
quite sure what you're going

77
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:58,360
to get Andy knows this as a potato

78
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,479
grower sometimes you uh you just don't

79
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,280
know what it looks like till you dig it

80
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:04,280
up I'm really conf this is this is

81
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,239
great yeah it's impressive how it's sort

82
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,598
of recess the the area where the bud

83
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,280
differentiates

84
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:17,839
from and what's different about Titan

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,120
that that compared to some other arams

86
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,039
is is it really rarely

87
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,399
produces what I would call a corlet uh

88
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,439
smaller corn other species like conc

89
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,000
would have uh quite a number of smaller

90
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,160
corn arms in there that you could grow

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,160
up if you wanted

92
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,759
so um aside from leaf cutting the way to

93
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,039
propagate Titans seems to be perceive if

94
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,919
I remember correctly reading it in in

95
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:45,918
one of these articles he he actually was

96
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:48,279
saying correct me if I'm wrong or look

97
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,599
this up but he was actually cutting one

98
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:52,319
of the

99
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,520
uh uh leaflets you know this is actually

100
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,959
a single leaf uh but he was cutting it

101
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:59,918
right here where it was first compounded

102
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,279
and rooting that and then eventually

103
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,079
what happens is a little bit form will

104
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,679
develop around the base of that so it is

105
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,038
possible to do these through Le cutting

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,439
but uh we haven't we haven't done that

107
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,439
here we get down to the corn and not

108
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,478
much else yeah I think it's it's I mean

109
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,839
I think at this point if we weigh it and

110
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:18,959
maybe you know I don't think there's

111
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:21,918
more than a pound of media that would be

112
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,680
getting weighed when I when I weighed we

113
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:27,359
stinky it actually weighed one weigh 51

114
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,038
lb but I had about this much or maybe a

115
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,038
little more promix on it so I just sort

116
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:34,560
of round it down down 50 so I was saying

117
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,399
earlier Craig you know the the pedial on

118
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,240
this was was much had a much wider

119
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:41,959
diameter than than the the last heroid

120
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
the last vegetative state of our our

121
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:46,439
flowering Titan so that was when I was

122
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:50,079
really excited about the fact that we

123
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:53,319
had obviously another strong specimen so

124
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,918
um the the actual diameter of the pedal

125
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,240
was was about here and you can see right

126
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,038
along the edge of plant where that or

127
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,720
the edge of this indication where that

128
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:07,318
was so what do you think should we take

129
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,319
this downstairs and wa one two

130
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:15,240
three I think it was about 16 close to

131
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:19,038
half a meter yeah yeah this is a decent

132
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,918
size Tim is a one of our Dutch interns

133
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,399
so he really knows uh geoides pretty

134
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,879
well youever seen have you ever seen a

135
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,879
Lily that

136
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,519
big amazing yeah

137
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,639
yeah we're going to go find out how much

138
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:39,439
it weighs okay so we're measuring in

139
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,439
pounds yes all

140
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:49,000
right all

141
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:50,680
righty wow 55.9 lb 55.9 lb including a

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,959
little bit of media but not too much

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,840
yeah I'm going to say that we're at

144
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,120
least 55 corn absolutely the corn would

145
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,719
probably I haven't actually paid

146
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,160
attention to these things over time but

147
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,960
I wouldn't be surprised if the corn

148
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,199
weight decreases for a little while as

149
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,359
it as it

150
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:10,319
descat uh So based on flower on the

151
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,919
weight it's it's a it is a blooming size

152
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,759
qu uh and I'm I'm really excited now to

153
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,279
see whether this does based on where

154
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,038
where I see the new but emerging my

155
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,399
hypothesis is that it will be a

156
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,079
vegetative stage which is also

157
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,079
encouraging that means that the ne when

158
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:28,240
it does Bloom you can have a really

159
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:31,000
large bloom this is this is a huge farm

160
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
so this is is this is as good as it

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,360
could I mean this is just way better

162
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,399
than anything thought it would be so

163
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,400
good news this could be not so weed

164
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,399
stinky

165
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,840
yeah this has been a production of

166
