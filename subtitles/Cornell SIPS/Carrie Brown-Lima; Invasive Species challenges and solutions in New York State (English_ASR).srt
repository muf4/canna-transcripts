1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:28,639
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:28,640
University problems and solutions

3
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:34,109
today's challenges and solutions in New

4
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,479
York State I am in a line a lot of the

5
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:38,700
problems and the species we have here

6
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,799
but I just want to talk a little bit

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,420
actually a lot about what we're doing

8
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,169
here in New York State to address those

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,140
problems we are actually really academic

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,420
a comparative I've worked out 30 for 11

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,060
years and it was so refreshing to come

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,450
back into this situation with the

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,520
resources of great people in their

14
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,890
position to actually accomplish

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,198
something for conservation and for

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:09,450
improving natural resources management

17
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:10,750
so I get started in that for those of

18
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,299
you I see that

19
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:19,030
that is just bear with me I was really

20
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:20,469
sure of the level of knowledge thought

21
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,079
that pieces and I wanted to make sure

22
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:26,650
we're on the same page before I go into

23
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:28,359
more specifics so I need to start making

24
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,910
sure that we all are speaking the same

25
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,739
language because there's a lot of

26
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:35,228
different terms that we see thrown

27
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:37,419
around when we're talking about species

28
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:40,599
that are native introduced not maybe

29
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:44,349
because I have a feeling we lose any

30
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,618
pets digits into what we're talking

31
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:47,439
about

32
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:49,420
like what species that are introducing

33
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,909
new to environment and they're

34
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,969
problematic and that's what we call in

35
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:57,819
existences so here in New York State we

36
00:01:54,969 --> 00:02:00,939
follow the National the National

37
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:03,250
definition or basic species and it's a

38
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:04,840
species that is not native ecosystem

39
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,939
under consideration and whose

40
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,520
introduction causes arts likely to cause

41
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:11,949
economic or environmental harm or harm

42
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,909
in human health and she considered it

43
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:19,589
actually has to have negative impacts

44
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:22,030
typically are greater than the benefits

45
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,530
and so just really quick Moorthy might

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,680
be the species were thinking about

47
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,689
species that had telomere hundreds of

48
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,819
thousands of years of a particular

49
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:34,090
region and so usually you need to have

50
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:37,169
like a regional to record qualifier like

51
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,170
New York

52
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,450
and you should really count species is

53
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,449
native if you were here before European

54
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:45,919
settlement what's not being a species

55
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:48,408
will diseases that comes from a

56
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,809
different place and there's a rise in

57
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:52,699
human activity deliberately or

58
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,318
accidentally I know a lot of important

59
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:56,689
with a lot of non-native species that

60
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,310
are not invasive and so I like to make

61
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:02,389
sure that we make this distinguishing

62
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:04,519
between now it makes it and not it so

63
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:07,029
the other part of the definition is that

64
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:11,439
it causes some sort of environmental

65
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:13,759
economic or harm to human health and so

66
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,799
you know those are actually things that

67
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,399
were concerned about when we're talking

68
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,769
about invasive species so I'm going to

69
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,289
give heard of giant hogweed

70
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:32,480
because even I want to lose I didn't

71
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:35,298
actually have heart attacks actually

72
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:39,310
copy images we find when we care you are

73
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:42,790
safe and ended up words actually

74
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:45,729
sunlight and severe burns across our

75
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:48,269
body we also sometimes forget that we

76
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:52,030
have increase in mosquitoes that carry

77
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,770
serious diseases like Zika virus we

78
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,140
forget that that black rat is not

79
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,569
necessarily needed and carries diseases

80
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:00,129
we have other diseases that are not even

81
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:02,560
that are are decimating our bat

82
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:05,979
populations and we're even finding that

83
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,810
some of these shrubs are related to our

84
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:11,619
association with Lyme disease and

85
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:16,449
increase tick populations of the

86
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:20,829
economic impact of our tuple first of

87
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:23,019
all we have the actual loss associated

88
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,569
with invasive species so for example

89
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:28,930
cited Regis table which many of you may

90
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:30,969
be familiar with here in your state was

91
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,728
purchased by Cornell that 7 million

92
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,620
dollars worth of fruit loss at least it

93
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:37,870
makes it nice very beautiful very

94
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,430
significant depends and then a couple

95
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,689
days later when you're home and ready to

96
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,240
eat them yeah

97
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:46,168
the unit full of larvae so you can

98
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,410
imagine the effect that has on on crops

99
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:53,049
well we have applause to to Fisheries in

100
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,840
the Great Lakes is sea lamprey breathe a

101
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,478
word to describe in part our sport fish

102
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:01,938
populations as you can see they latch on

103
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:04,008
then we have other impacts on our

104
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:07,430
forests which are very significant when

105
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:10,550
we have to cut loose trees that article

106
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,430
for timber such as action so on and the

107
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,168
other part of the it also even and he

108
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,269
ceases and leaves you see that were

109
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:19,098
dying so it down significantly

110
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:21,588
we the legs are quite that the species

111
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:23,899
ability over swim in that and then

112
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:26,149
that's it the second part we should have

113
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:28,429
the economic impact that impacts of the

114
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:31,938
possibly one percent you control them

115
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:35,538
and so on - there's an estimate about

116
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:38,930
sixty seven billion defenders going

117
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:40,878
until 2005 and really have very part

118
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,189
time quantifying those impacts that they

119
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:47,060
are zooming in and they are difficult to

120
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:49,009
manage and then you know and this is

121
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,370
kind of my area where to conservation

122
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:54,620
biology for many years and so this is

123
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,199
kind of impact that that I think about

124
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,259
anonymity truth but and that's the

125
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,370
logical impact of invasive species

126
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,259
there's just a belief you choose

127
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,838
biodiversity in that residents are the

128
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:09,348
second greatest threat next to a boss at

129
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:12,259
attack impacting species as a basis to

130
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:14,088
survive Danny Jean doing species that we

131
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:17,538
care about here in our state we have

132
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:20,598
sworn and verging on the heartburn just

133
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:21,529
an hour north of here and we have other

134
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:25,740
other

135
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:27,959
species hybridizing databases

136
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,329
hyperresonant naked and we're losing

137
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,000
this time editions as well it's a direct

138
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:35,609
sequence system functioning and also to

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,649
start specialized relationships and i

140
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,870
want to point out this word exact alley

141
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:41,729
north of a bringing a general we may be

142
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,550
familiar with that because it's over a

143
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:47,460
field where he really points out these

144
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,620
really specific interactions these

145
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:51,839
photographs are are dr. Tommy's he's an

146
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,090
amazing photographer to everybody a

147
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,229
presentation about them please go out of

148
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:57,839
their way to do it

149
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:01,290
but we have these very specific

150
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:04,199
interactions between insects and their

151
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,030
host plants sometimes it's like monarch

152
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,639
butterfly they and I want specific

153
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:11,819
species to complete their lifecycle and

154
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,759
so when we change that by introducing

155
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:16,980
non-native species we actually lose that

156
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,629
and he hits a movable research he's

157
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,759
actually talking about it he was here a

158
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:22,769
couple of years back where do you want

159
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,659
me happy to discover experts and

160
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:28,139
insurance collects all the species they

161
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,480
find on a HTC's and then all the insects

162
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:34,409
me signify my baby's uses an element all

163
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,879
the Olympic high on ornamental plants so

164
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,719
these aren't even invasive species

165
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:42,999
necessarily they're just mine

166
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:46,899
in a landscape yard and see is Amanda

167
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:50,289
her little black on and hope he got five

168
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:54,189
her 18 species and we get down to the

169
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:57,548
crater all three if they're like this up

170
00:07:54,189 --> 00:08:00,159
this is also limited by dr. Tommy as you

171
00:07:57,548 --> 00:08:03,368
can see these species are important not

172
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:06,038
just for their existence that they

173
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:08,949
supported through weapons such as I work

174
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:11,019
feeding their nominee and so on as he

175
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:12,968
says here in our mental support twenty

176
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:17,619
nine times last five person in a

177
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:21,278
department so let's shift gears a little

178
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:24,039
from the impacts to Mesa species here in

179
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:25,149
New York State right now I have a basis

180
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:27,818
which are they're talking a little bit

181
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:29,619
more about later every year there are

182
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:32,288
changes because we have more species

183
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:34,839
partially more reporting and partially

184
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:37,448
due to more species coming in right now

185
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,639
we have four members of the species that

186
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:42,490
are every level Smith basicness in their

187
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:45,970
duties in acting as one of every year

188
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:48,818
that I exit and one commutable about

189
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:53,620
your currency is we have more success

190
00:08:48,818 --> 00:08:56,049
than any other state in the US and this

191
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,320
is very fast significance because work

192
00:08:56,049 --> 00:09:02,479
as a really

193
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,520
only the only basis bc ii or the only

194
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,409
impact the converging way out tree

195
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:11,449
species within a matter of decades so

196
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:13,759
this is one that I focus on quite a bit

197
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:17,060
because he's one that has such merit

198
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:20,389
accident in we have many horses in New

199
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:24,799
York 62 type of aging effect such as

200
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:28,269
emiliya Dungey emerald ash borer 1/2

201
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:30,309
inch bubble will southern pine beetle

202
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:33,769
chestnut late into learning whatever

203
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:36,549
judgments and melissa is on I'm just

204
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:39,730
very much like it's a tightly one or two

205
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:43,759
came in from Asia and it's thinner since

206
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,590
2002 in the u.s. spread to New York and

207
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,799
here we were about to lose all of our

208
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:51,019
actions now you're saying is dys basics

209
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:55,039
easy so don't get invited places to get

210
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:58,009
high but you know tubular sections of

211
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,699
been lost and it's spreading across the

212
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,700
state of New York

213
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,580
however I go back to say there are

214
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:10,759
solutions being being sought out for

215
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,620
this so it's not necessarily just a lot

216
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,450
so we think we solve our actually have

217
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,549
cheap banks were Mia programs and are

218
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:19,580
collecting seeds we're looking for

219
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:21,449
assistance in hash to try as if you can

220
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:25,290
find as individual

221
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:27,090
and we also have a very advanced bio

222
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:29,039
control program that will hopefully

223
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,410
start kicking in and helping some of

224
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:34,079
these - device so I don't want to be up

225
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:36,389
all negative about that but there is

226
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,430
another species and I specifically point

227
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:40,289
this out here because I want you all to

228
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,939
be aware of it since you're out a lot

229
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:43,620
it's really important that we have a lot

230
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,260
of eyes out there looking for the

231
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:51,259
species I was how the spider-man to fly

232
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:56,100
it was introduced into conveniently 2014

233
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:59,189
he came in on on slabs of granite that

234
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,730
were imported from Asia and since then

235
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,260
because it's become a pest like we never

236
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,570
imagined it would be ten the

237
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:10,919
Pennsylvania there's quarantines trying

238
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:13,050
to keep it out it keep it had many uses

239
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,459
in South Korea that never even seen the

240
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:16,979
kind of behavior that we're seeing here

241
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:21,300
with it population expansion it is

242
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:24,389
attacking grapes apples hops maybe

243
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:27,029
doesn't necessarily eat the fruits it

244
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:30,740
actually just screams a honeydew on that

245
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:36,209
that makes them on several efforts

246
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:39,000
and even with even with pesticides there

247
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,920
because this is so large they can't keep

248
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,159
them off it so right now we're actually

249
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:46,649
have have a live look out where to work

250
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,490
we're trying very hard to contain it

251
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:51,319
down

252
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,600
versus those whose hearts are very

253
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,430
important to our economy as well but I

254
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,509
think every country as I told you many

255
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:00,559
of you are out about it would happen

256
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:03,019
opportunity to see this and it's very

257
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:07,759
difficult to miss as you can see the

258
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:17,299
spread on its ways and it kind of like

259
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:21,679
this discussing yes no it's actually

260
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:24,439
sucking the flow of my plate and I'm an

261
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:36,769
ecologist but what through the graves

262
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:38,240
are to excrete it I need you in order to

263
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,039
make slip through where you can summon

264
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,690
it offensive plan to the plants have

265
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:44,120
less productivity is just common sense

266
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,580
of energy needs to go for a over shop

267
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,210
and they are up in arms they don't know

268
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,480
what to do about it

269
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:54,139
so keep an eye out for it and if to

270
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,029
reported to the GC if you have it and we

271
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:58,340
all know a lot of the party bases here

272
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:02,669
in our sleep if you have heard about

273
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:05,649
credibility driller we have

274
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:08,829
trying desperately not to let spread of

275
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:14,740
new DC species this clunky everything in

276
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:20,500
here is a study starve and die of sorry

277
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:23,019
still missing but it actually is an

278
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,940
algae that forms like layer and layer

279
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:28,090
and layer there's no control method

280
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,340
known and the Senate who traveled in the

281
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,060
Midwest for two years in recently

282
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,530
serving problematic in New York see

283
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:38,289
indicated appearance for muscles as well

284
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,539
which assistant a little bit just an

285
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:42,039
example of the Qasim I generally very

286
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:43,569
important as talking would be aquatic

287
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:45,879
invasive species working it for the

288
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,520
state she said they've spent over 15

289
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,889
million Jets her treatments since 2011

290
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:53,500
and it's only about a couple elevations

291
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:56,049
and so you can imagine possible and

292
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:01,899
trying to prevent makes me choke

293
00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:03,990
definitely they are in Florida digest

294
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:06,490
for the two we've got hundreds of them

295
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:10,899
one of the challenges we've been dealing

296
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:12,549
with is this swath word yeah black

297
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:16,629
swallower which is very difficult to

298
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:18,789
control it spreading rapidly many seas

299
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:21,460
and many of the shortness of shrouding

300
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:24,329
who may be familiar with and I just

301
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,740
wanted to point out on earthworms as a

302
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,360
specialist species that I think we need

303
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,769
to be thinking about a little more here

304
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,649
and then I'm actually

305
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:34,239
have section and trying to our database

306
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:36,220
here a new artists and trying to collect

307
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,869
more information on you know you can

308
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,600
think a lot of times that first of all

309
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:42,850
or to return the image in this area we

310
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,509
don't have any meaning in terms but over

311
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,909
par the south we do a couple of species

312
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:50,739
but our workers here are not needed and

313
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:53,769
while they may be good for aerating

314
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:56,040
swells so farmers say they're really bad

315
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,688
for us and so we suddenly search there

316
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,548
it we're not missing going on in and

317
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:03,009
other fixes have show that it reduces

318
00:15:00,548 --> 00:15:05,409
deep litter that he's the soil of course

319
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:09,009
right analyzed and I think I should

320
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:12,578
student apply in the mcc ci' versity and

321
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:15,308
an increase in invasive plants easy in

322
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:17,409
the decrease in the soil moisture is

323
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:21,068
also result in decrease and arthropods

324
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:22,778
such as detected salamanders in grandmas

325
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:25,238
birds and so on and so forth and so

326
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:27,938
there it is this return and there's

327
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:30,489
actually you can record a if you find in

328
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:31,688
these forums you can report it really

329
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:34,540
making a better understand their

330
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:36,998
distribution so those of you who aren't

331
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:39,159
doing a lot probably see it and it's

332
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:42,100
also a big deal for people who are

333
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:44,499
selling plants that are Kylie good soil

334
00:15:42,100 --> 00:16:00,278
or selling mulch because that house one

335
00:15:44,499 --> 00:16:02,259
of the witnesses from camera comes here

336
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:04,509
as well the critical part is the one

337
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:05,870
that's enemies really and jumping all

338
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:08,060
over the place

339
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,830
they urge about because it's all legally

340
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:11,089
with there are pieces of nerve damage

341
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,810
right there the one that they're

342
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:19,100
actually really looking for reporting in

343
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:22,549
the Davies is the agent jumping horn or

344
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:30,970
crazy snake work or whatever they call

345
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:34,099
it but yes we find it and um - you know

346
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,379
diseases they're problematic you have

347
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,269
other things that are happening and

348
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:40,399
they're impacting our ecosystems they're

349
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:43,460
actually also helping invasive species

350
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:49,090
spread further I will get to the good

351
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:51,560
part eventually for the solution part so

352
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:55,610
something that is caring about obviously

353
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:57,889
everywhere you go on the news it's on up

354
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,509
and let gene is really interesting

355
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:01,789
because we're seeing and we're just

356
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:04,430
learning and really starting to gather

357
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:06,529
data on how it's impacting invasive

358
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,269
species and I can have a whole hour talk

359
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:11,809
on that and so I'm not commissioned to

360
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:14,680
quickly go through a few of the ways the

361
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:14,679
rising temperatures

362
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,380
okay it's early spring I'll be back over

363
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:21,730
there and you can see that I'm sure when

364
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,800
you're out in the woods it was first

365
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,870
released in English and not enough story

366
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:27,490
those are usually invasive species so

367
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,529
they react and then they gave me

368
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,630
advantage where the native species don't

369
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:33,759
have that assisity to do so

370
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,410
they're also expanding their range

371
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,569
they're moving north they can live

372
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:40,480
farther north now they can survive the

373
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:42,460
features also we've had storms that are

374
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,860
creating disturbances which invasive

375
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,140
species love that they adapt to

376
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:50,049
disturbances and also this interesting

377
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,880
little picture I can't even reserve this

378
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:55,329
completely this study so much

379
00:17:51,880 --> 00:18:00,310
it looked it increased co2 levels in the

380
00:17:55,329 --> 00:18:02,500
lab and when they share the matter what

381
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:06,609
species it is but then when you have

382
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:11,019
higher co2 in basic species can respond

383
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:13,659
to that and her faster then even in the

384
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:16,029
same higher co2 and beyond that they're

385
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,860
more resistant to herbicides so it's

386
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:19,480
really interesting a little challenge

387
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:22,689
the way we manage a lot of these weeds

388
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:27,759
in both agriculture antonov and the

389
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:29,769
natural settings over Rd seem like the

390
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,960
range of my way indulgence nobody ever

391
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:35,200
product of the way around axes is she

392
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,500
cold surviving losers and it's a big

393
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,640
norm and we value if you look at its

394
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,529
just weird like a Martian or

395
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,809
and we've been seeing it move up and

396
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:48,379
it's like winters and it's adapted to

397
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:49,849
cold spells and unfortunately it was a

398
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,150
factor with the number of other species

399
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:55,849
as well and predictions of showing this

400
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,590
is from my Jetta alan through an agent

401
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:59,480
indefinitely rapidly from us and

402
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:01,159
predictions are showing that the more

403
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,110
this will kind of be a hot slide the

404
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,850
teacher recommendations so we really

405
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:09,079
need to keep an eye out to be proactive

406
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:12,019
about about not juicing these species

407
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:14,808
that we thought were plus into America

408
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:16,799
and there's another cool study that was

409
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:19,980
done by Steve Rankin

410
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,049
and here looking at this is relevant for

411
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,960
you all in your field as well he was a

412
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:29,819
hit movie scale at sex

413
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:31,950
cruel they're not native species and he

414
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:34,529
was looking at snoozing cities that are

415
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,120
slightly warmer and drier the same kinds

416
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:38,970
of conditions that we expected some

417
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:42,000
regions due to climate change and

418
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,160
guaranteed slightly cooler outside City

419
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,890
inside the oyster it was finding that

420
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,840
the scales like had an explosion in

421
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,590
their population and even in a college

422
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:53,849
degree warmer environment climate

423
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:55,409
infinity started negatively impacting

424
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:58,049
the trees so there's wind review tests

425
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,779
they aren't you can probably see where

426
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:03,210
species their species are there and

427
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:04,789
under the new climate conditions they're

428
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:09,690
about to explode

429
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:11,730
so another change that we're seeing in

430
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,970
our environment and impact ever seen on

431
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:17,400
our on our lives within our burdens and

432
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,529
in our forests are the increase in

433
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,070
white-tailed deer populations and this

434
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:26,399
is an estate rise for four decades now

435
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:28,889
to degree sent in G of ever better

436
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,460
conditions for them to survive to more

437
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:34,419
winters and you know not really thinking

438
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,980
and I was

439
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:38,019
but we're not talking about what they're

440
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,389
doing when they're out of the woods this

441
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:43,960
is taken at night and these are native

442
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:46,648
seedlings that were planted as part of

443
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,649
an experiment

444
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:56,919
[Music]

445
00:20:53,048 --> 00:21:00,319
and I would say the camera may say that

446
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:02,778
but we can see how completely one tear

447
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,028
couple of seconds can really take that

448
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:07,638
media vegetation and they're kind of

449
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:09,259
picky eaters as you can see them from

450
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:11,628
probably from your apartments they don't

451
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:14,808
really like a lot of the invasive

452
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:17,388
species or introduced species and so um

453
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:19,220
you know and I'm just I can go into much

454
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:22,728
more detail on this to return to show

455
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:27,169
you is it they're also helping induces

456
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:29,298
BC spray so some researchers are analogy

457
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:31,340
that was an antibiotic as well as many

458
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:34,638
others have done fencing experiments

459
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:36,558
where they finished out the tear in the

460
00:21:34,638 --> 00:21:38,478
CV compare what happens inside and

461
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,608
outside and when you can see in that

462
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:42,288
actually this really invasive species

463
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:45,019
that we insert are highly problematic

464
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:47,690
here in New York the Vitamix is with G

465
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:50,479
significantly when it's inside the fence

466
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,700
and airlift out because the GR new

467
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:54,649
mother we the vegetation and actually

468
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:57,859
went deeper into this study to show that

469
00:21:54,648 --> 00:22:00,079
we hit the trillion G better we have

470
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:02,679
more native species in silence and

471
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,629
outside of Internet

472
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,220
there where you can see the still

473
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,080
breasts right right up to the fence line

474
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,390
and then it stops

475
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,849
you can usually mix meditation on the

476
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,380
inside and so you know we've got not

477
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:16,750
only the species here but we have all

478
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:20,020
these facilitating factors that are

479
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:22,119
helping that's right so it appears a

480
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:23,889
little bit and in chakra as we're

481
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:25,509
speaking about solutions for invasive

482
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,210
species we need to really think about

483
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:31,180
how they get here to begin with right so

484
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,350
that's the first place to start so a lot

485
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,170
of them have been introduced

486
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:37,419
purposefully intentionally years because

487
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:40,390
we thought they'd be good for securing

488
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,580
erosion on streamside such as the

489
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:45,460
tamarisk a jacuzzi and a future it's

490
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:48,609
that much more than scare the episode on

491
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,829
the stream side we've also introduced

492
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:52,809
them like the Shakespeare enthusiast

493
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:54,369
introduced many enemies in Birds we have

494
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:56,889
here today from Europe because they were

495
00:22:54,369 --> 00:23:01,179
mentioned in Shakespeare's books like

496
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:02,950
the Starling certainly house fear this

497
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,759
is a flock of starlings that you

498
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:08,350
probably seen quickly coming in the fall

499
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,990
and also at some point we actually used

500
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:12,789
to do experiments or interacting species

501
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,579
into the field as if they control other

502
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:18,319
species without screaming anything

503
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:20,720
such as the key to those it should be

504
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:22,878
sent to you in trucks Charlie and a

505
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,798
completely taking over I said if you

506
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:27,439
have a chance to see that yeah it's

507
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:31,158
really funny just researching their

508
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,808
movie on pages that's a really funny

509
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,269
movie that's real shocking of what

510
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:37,099
they've done but you know a lot of what

511
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:40,490
we're seeing now are not potentially

512
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:43,908
directions in one direction you see see

513
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:47,538
see Samia - das partnerships in packing

514
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:53,169
materials on plans and produce transport

515
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:53,169
and listen to the pet Raven and

516
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:58,179
and so those are the main unintentional

517
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,968
pathways that were splitting a lot of

518
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:03,340
species come in on and so since its

519
00:24:00,969 --> 00:24:06,038
trade that's driving a lot of these

520
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:08,918
introductions we need to think about

521
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:10,839
trim the situation of trade today and

522
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:12,609
we've actually seen a horrible old in

523
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,769
the recent shipment during the past 20

524
00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:17,319
years and the threefold increase in air

525
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:20,259
travels at past 20 years and it's just a

526
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:22,479
phenomenal amount of travel of transport

527
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:24,038
of goods allow a species to come in and

528
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:34,389
it really makes our work challenging

529
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:36,219
than likely this you know the number

530
00:24:34,388 --> 00:24:37,689
that we're giving introduce senator

531
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:38,739
balance we don't need to be quite as

532
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,700
vigilant or anything

533
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:44,798
in fact didn't even vote from the Forest

534
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,479
Service it really just makes any we're

535
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,440
sure they even though we're depleting

536
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:52,479
and this is just an important insects

537
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,249
for Part B Dulce is one of those each

538
00:24:52,479 --> 00:25:00,909
other oh there's that this actually

539
00:24:54,249 --> 00:25:03,098
translates across taxa the species in

540
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:04,539
potentially the interviews but it's a

541
00:25:03,098 --> 00:25:06,158
celebration of imports and the

542
00:25:04,538 --> 00:25:08,710
likelihood that they could be here

543
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,599
Chisholm pumping in Avery anytime soon

544
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,259
from having introduction so this is an

545
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:16,178
area where we have to be super attentive

546
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:19,778
in New York actually are pretty

547
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:21,599
vulnerable here genuine reductions we

548
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:26,618
have a lot of woods coming

549
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:27,908
good packaging 23% of the planet Santa

550
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:31,028
they're not sure you come through they

551
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:33,580
work in communities actually a pretty

552
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:36,700
similar vinyl pretty similar conditions

553
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:38,949
to those sorts of a lot of our students

554
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,989
which is Asia and so we're a temperate

555
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,058
zone and they can get there and so

556
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:45,220
getting there should have pieces of

557
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:48,638
evidence is beyond just average so if we

558
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,829
have recognition and matching conditions

559
00:25:48,638 --> 00:25:57,278
for from their home range we can

560
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:58,689
actually a lot of them to establish so I

561
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,548
want to say it's just coming into

562
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:03,159
shipping so you know we had were

563
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:14,288
welcomed into the big lab CD and many

564
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:16,479
others so into a solution it was a big

565
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:19,569
problem here in New York and wanted to

566
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:21,399
do something about it so you know people

567
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:24,269
investments were right here

568
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:27,689
arrey arrey Cornell

569
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:28,798
published 12 recommendations and I will

570
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,499
go through each of these recommendations

571
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,969
but what I cannot say about this

572
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:34,679
recommendation and I'll talk a little

573
00:26:32,969 --> 00:26:36,959
bit about some of them they said they

574
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,909
all actually be implemented which you're

575
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:41,129
only seen here before it come out and

576
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:43,769
then people take actually actually do

577
00:26:41,128 --> 00:26:45,958
the recommendations so that was that was

578
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,459
part of the battle here in New York and

579
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:50,009
one of them in the permanent leadership

580
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:52,048
structure and actually an advisory

581
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:55,528
committee member here which is very nice

582
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:58,618
we have a new species council which is

583
00:26:55,528 --> 00:27:01,200
chased down a lot of the decisions about

584
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:04,288
path where the teacher New York is made

585
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,359
up of the nine agency agencies this

586
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:09,628
co-chair coyotes to be in their part of

587
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:11,788
that department and then species issues

588
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:14,269
prioritizes home being recognized

589
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:17,940
legislation and their devised by the

590
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:20,038
species advisory committees and they

591
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,129
give information to the council on

592
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:25,469
health recommendations on decision made

593
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:27,628
and it's made up of 25 members including

594
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:29,338
people from industries instead oh it's

595
00:27:27,628 --> 00:27:31,558
been really important over time to make

596
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:33,749
sure industry is involved and you have

597
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:37,798
industry representatives that are on the

598
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:39,538
advisory committee so it's great to be

599
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:40,979
involved we've seen a lot more industry

600
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:42,959
participation and it really helps

601
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:45,979
balance our decisions about basic

602
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:48,298
species when we have that kind of input

603
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:51,919
so we also have our toes on the ground

604
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:55,918
here in New York the partnerships

605
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,720
managing all the prisms there's eight of

606
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,940
them they cover the whole state each

607
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,470
prism it used to be they two tentacles

608
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,359
and coordinator now they actually have

609
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,149
staff and interns

610
00:28:03,358 --> 00:28:08,999
and they're up there to get people to

611
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:11,758
work together and prioritize elusive

612
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:14,220
species management and do it and also

613
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,808
educating and outreach to the public

614
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,079
about different in these two species

615
00:28:15,808 --> 00:28:21,329
issues a little cool about this is

616
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:24,388
actually one of the only states in the

617
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:28,288
region actually in much of the u.s. that

618
00:28:24,388 --> 00:28:30,358
had this this comprehensive coverage

619
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:32,368
where we have people out around this

620
00:28:30,358 --> 00:28:34,138
makes my job really easy because I have

621
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:35,939
all these contact points that and have

622
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:38,158
their groups and so we can actually

623
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,429
twenty makes it easy to responses into

624
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,409
action within this system employer for

625
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:45,599
example they actually have thousands of

626
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:47,009
species I thought was something I'd like

627
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:49,108
to see it basically determine our

628
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:50,639
Atlanta supporter or workshop Victoria

629
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:53,249
and then I felt it

630
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:56,579
so the portraits in excuses in our

631
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:59,778
database or in a big house and they have

632
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:02,460
this conference assistant with unpaid

633
00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:03,598
individuals that it's like 10% of their

634
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,340
job working on it

635
00:29:03,598 --> 00:29:07,798
so even as you see that some of the

636
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:10,319
other states have presented higher it is

637
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:14,908
actually an artist with very proud to

638
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:17,740
mention the discouraged funded and part

639
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:20,720
of this program is also

640
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:23,870
this is really important for people who

641
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,759
are at mckeil and understand that plant

642
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:28,159
identification and inside augmentation

643
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,289
or you can just want to learn about it

644
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,590
to be able to report what you're seeing

645
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:35,990
or do surveys and identify the

646
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:38,329
distribution of these species a lot of

647
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:41,059
them are new we really depend on citizen

648
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:43,159
scientists to provide this information

649
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:45,019
because we can't make people to be

650
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,790
everywhere all the time trying to record

651
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:49,099
this data so this isn't there's

652
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:50,480
trainings all the time they have a they

653
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:52,819
go around the state you can do them

654
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,230
online or teachers didn't just take my

655
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:57,259
hat back and make system you are

656
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:59,390
committing it information and then part

657
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:01,069
of this system is all the recommendation

658
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,620
with the information of the basics you

659
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:07,220
see two Research Institute which is the

660
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:09,889
Institute that I drank and the Institute

661
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,600
is to communicate and native species

662
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:13,850
research they'll prevent and manage

663
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:16,579
effectively basic species in yaariyaan

664
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:18,949
so the information is out there and

665
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:22,220
we're making webinars and conferences of

666
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:25,370
CCA in service in the hall as a basis to

667
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:27,440
extrapolate learning also making sure

668
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:29,449
that researchers are communicating their

669
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,070
information and then also I actually

670
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:33,470
people out of Iran that are generally

671
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:35,059
invasive species to find out what is it

672
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:37,069
that they need to know what what are

673
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:38,658
their artisan species are dealing with

674
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:40,460
where where are the information

675
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:42,619
then I can rotate and promote

676
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,869
researchers actually that research so

677
00:30:42,618 --> 00:30:46,519
I'm more of the Research Institute it

678
00:30:44,868 --> 00:30:48,408
doesn't have a staff of a bunch of

679
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,269
research language they put hands on this

680
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:54,609
network and collaborations to get things

681
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:56,659
done so this is what it looks like and

682
00:30:54,608 --> 00:30:58,428
this is all funded through the

683
00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:00,950
University Environmental Protection Fund

684
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:04,190
and so it has a continuous funding

685
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:07,460
language it has been essentially moving

686
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:11,149
you separate or just so maybe you

687
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:13,519
recognize some cases in there and so

688
00:31:11,148 --> 00:31:16,008
what are these persons doing well we're

689
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,798
doing their job prevention detection and

690
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:22,368
management of the basic species so

691
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:27,408
ranging from promoting regulations and

692
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:29,928
advising on and regulated species she

693
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:32,769
tries to detect species early and

694
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:35,149
getting out there to washing boats and

695
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:42,038
coming up with new solutions and

696
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:45,228
training volunteers inside cementation

697
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:50,509
basic species and how many ones in this

698
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:53,479
division her the president okay so is

699
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:55,628
actually is how it helps us bring our

700
00:31:53,479 --> 00:32:00,528
thinking for invasive species management

701
00:31:55,628 --> 00:32:02,319
so we care the bottom you can see you're

702
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:05,200
catching TB prevention

703
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:10,388
hedging species before it gets

704
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,819
I just talked about and the control

705
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:15,459
costs for that as you can see are below

706
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:17,980
as so as you go up to her

707
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,889
the area affected by the species

708
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,929
increases its over time and the control

709
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:27,519
costs increase and also the likelihood

710
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:30,820
of managing or our eradicate disease

711
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,909
decreases and so what we like to do is

712
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:35,439
prevent as we get further up eradication

713
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:37,330
becomes more difficult so early

714
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,548
detection we want to try to get it when

715
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:41,048
it's in this yellow area so in this

716
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:43,778
yellow part of the curve so we can

717
00:32:41,048 --> 00:32:45,908
actually have a chance of controlling it

718
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:48,548
but then once it's widespread that many

719
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:52,450
of the species you know barbarian or and

720
00:32:48,548 --> 00:32:54,129
the last war or storms but we really

721
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:57,850
just are managing our access or

722
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:59,470
protecting this truth or this time but

723
00:32:57,849 --> 00:33:01,959
we're not going to get rid of it unless

724
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:05,490
we come up with a longer-term solution

725
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,490
which I'll talk about afterwards as well

726
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:16,960
okay so as imaging we have a few we're

727
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:20,409
turning in the pathways and so I think

728
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,538
detail about a couple of these first of

729
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:25,059
all we have a blue washing program here

730
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:27,099
in New York State was in expanding and

731
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:29,019
what we're trying to do is prevent the

732
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:31,449
spread of invasive species from one way

733
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:33,369
to another so this is an example of a

734
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:35,710
way that we've been working we have a

735
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:37,719
policing f of X have no invasive species

736
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:40,419
at all so we want to keep these pieces

737
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,240
out of the states and we want you along

738
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:45,278
and teaching them just where they're at

739
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,200
so that we can keep it keep them in

740
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:50,470
minus five

741
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,390
we also have as a company are familiar

742
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:58,960
with the regulated and prohibited

743
00:33:52,390 --> 00:34:01,390
species okay so another view I wish it

744
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,278
just really quickly this is not on there

745
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:05,200
because it's not my presentation because

746
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,808
I usually don't talk about the ins and

747
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,550
outs of it the legislation what I wanted

748
00:34:07,808 --> 00:34:10,929
to shoot to share a little bit of

749
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:14,649
additional information to those of you

750
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:17,950
who aren't familiar with it so as of

751
00:34:14,648 --> 00:34:20,108
2015 so this is this presentation was

752
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:23,049
passed on to me I take Atlas he is a

753
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:25,000
coordinator for that basis BC section

754
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:28,690
and the Department of our conservation

755
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,820
here here and so we have two types of

756
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,309
species on this list we have prohibited

757
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:37,929
species which is completely illegal to

758
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:39,909
possess or Egyptian or or introduced and

759
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:42,579
then we have regular bit invasive

760
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:46,269
species so you really can't reduce it

761
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:49,569
into the wild and I go to all the

762
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:52,539
definitions here but you can keep it

763
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:54,550
yourself if you want to you can sell it

764
00:34:52,539 --> 00:35:00,849
by a transfer as long as it's kind of

765
00:34:54,550 --> 00:35:03,490
control and they're juicy so they're

766
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:05,559
using them for landscaping you can

767
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:07,929
certainly provide more information from

768
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:09,789
the GCP or the department that part it's

769
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:11,739
on this who actually Nations with a

770
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:14,829
label on them and written notice must be

771
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:20,679
provided to clients that these species

772
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:24,759
are regulated and that they are if you

773
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:28,199
want to use the pregnancy seized you can

774
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,640
apply for a permit it's not always

775
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:33,639
reason for turmeric leaf or research

776
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,559
education or other protections but so

777
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:37,420
there are some exceptions apparently

778
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:40,869
that I don't know what these would be

779
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:43,809
that you didn't try and then also we can

780
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:45,670
fold ours where they they're trying to

781
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:49,929
through circle parse or some of the most

782
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:53,320
used invasive landscaping plants ones

783
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:55,719
that are able to reproduce and that are

784
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,170
cell and so there are some options that

785
00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:00,778
are developed by researchers and I guess

786
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,309
part of an introduced thing I was on the

787
00:36:00,778 --> 00:36:03,900
committee that was looking at some of

788
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:06,298
these assignment apart maybe it's

789
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:10,410
another grasses they have a personal

790
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:13,380
mercenary mercy this time and the

791
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:15,509
drivers offer you their our booklets on

792
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,059
the plants and the animals you can also

793
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,720
get them on the TCC website a

794
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:23,940
pediatrician and there's also no

795
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:26,509
presentations and different a session so

796
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,940
there are resources for you and this is

797
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:32,250
some type information and whatever you

798
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,048
down directions at the market some havoc

799
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:38,579
you can certainly be tested at dcara

800
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:40,259
markets or more info so I would say

801
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:44,519
there are couple things that before I

802
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:47,789
finish is that they are art the art

803
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:49,768
regulating preventing species from being

804
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,990
spread within the state of New York or

805
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:54,328
petition coming into New York but they

806
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:56,489
don't keep species out of the country

807
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:59,039
none of our hurting attributes for

808
00:36:56,489 --> 00:37:00,868
prevention here in mercy are preventing

809
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:04,799
the next emerald ash borer from coming

810
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:06,690
in from era there are some credible and

811
00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:08,579
if you probably know this figures in the

812
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,289
plant world that their restrictions on

813
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:12,980
which plants and commanded think they're

814
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:15,809
going to basically to do inspections

815
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:19,548
there are certain treatments a white

816
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:22,859
lesions we patents are a source of

817
00:37:19,548 --> 00:37:24,838
course has as well as where you planted

818
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:27,449
in the same general as where the market

819
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:29,608
lenses of the big risks right now there

820
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:31,529
are some treatments in please

821
00:37:29,608 --> 00:37:34,529
English question hot weather there

822
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:37,380
as we still continue to get new species

823
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:39,330
and so I went to the federal version if

824
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:44,880
that is an important aspect in New York

825
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:46,619
should expand this focus too so the next

826
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,539
part of the curve is this yellow part

827
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:53,400
that I talked about and it's a finding a

828
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:55,670
needle in a haystack a lot of the time

829
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,170
if you're gonna find this species before

830
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:02,309
it's at this population is growing

831
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:04,260
enough you you need a general you need

832
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:06,929
to get out of there but it's really hard

833
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:10,680
to find these small lands or the first

834
00:38:06,929 --> 00:38:14,339
insect and so near New York apartment a

835
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:17,250
lot of ways of finding the training

836
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,349
volunteers Newark has a really cool

837
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:21,840
German program where they're actually

838
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:25,410
looking at force how the reducing lands

839
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,539
AppData to us different satellites to

840
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:29,879
detect early infestations and some of

841
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:32,369
these forest pests we have to comply

842
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,170
sure it Cornell he's up he's a top

843
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:36,030
researcher working with environmental

844
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:39,960
DNA where you can take a water sample

845
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:42,720
and detect whether these species is in

846
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,960
that water body or whether dangerous

847
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,959
diseases and that water so and we've

848
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,409
also even

849
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,659
with conservation dogs who are excellent

850
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:55,480
at making things early and in fact

851
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:57,639
appear here and every day for our part

852
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,338
for the Extension Service we're going to

853
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,230
have a whole section on how you can play

854
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:05,170
conservation thoughts their detection of

855
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:06,309
invasive species orphan research just to

856
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,730
make this is something that interests

857
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:22,269
you and then finally there's long term

858
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:24,369
management so the last part is see what

859
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:25,780
we're looking at as our solution to

860
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:28,240
start what do we do when there's

861
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,200
actually a huge population and twice

862
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,009
we're processing

863
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:36,279
so we conserve washes you can spray them

864
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:40,300
we can remove them physically or we can

865
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:43,990
introduce a natural predator that only

866
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:46,750
feeds on that species in order to in

867
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:48,729
order to the toilet and up that's

868
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,639
actually is there a long-term solution

869
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:53,380
and I'll touch it a little bit weren't

870
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,868
some of the projects we have coming in

871
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,519
in your state but this it's never made

872
00:39:55,869 --> 00:40:00,099
that are introducing fire controls are

873
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,170
very carefully swinging can't have and

874
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:04,519
have it tested to make sure they don't

875
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,639
be anything or do something

876
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:09,420
[Music]

877
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:11,190
but it's targeted to so I just wanted to

878
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,840
go back a little bit to talk about some

879
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,659
initiatives of the narrative basic

880
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,608
species research has going on and the

881
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:20,969
kinds of things were doing to to help

882
00:40:17,608 --> 00:40:23,460
the room better and more informed in a

883
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:27,419
thesis disease prevention control and

884
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:30,150
and early detection so what we've been

885
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,220
really focusing on Alliance control

886
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:34,200
methods but unless you don't know if

887
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:36,599
we're actually successful this is kind

888
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:39,689
of a problem for invasive species of

889
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:41,699
management because we get funding Jim

890
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:45,420
Anderson and the funding doesn't allow

891
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:47,639
for post-treatment monitoring in an

892
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,200
example of this I found that a Great

893
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:53,730
Lakes restoration initiative but they

894
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:55,679
actually sent 2530 million for crack my

895
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:58,380
knees spread by this is something we're

896
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:01,199
all familiar that a wetland plant that's

897
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:04,590
very problematic and widespread in her

898
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,689
control at least went over certainly

899
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:09,900
over a five year period to control

900
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:12,000
Phragmites there were no reports

901
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,099
included in that funding of whether it

902
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,019
was successful they only recorded the

903
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:19,349
amount least three the number of people

904
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:22,550
they employed the area and cover and

905
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:27,319
there's no funding for them to do that

906
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:27,320
so one of our partners

907
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:33,318
he went out and they measure we threw up

908
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,910
with a hot July every other with their

909
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:36,349
own money they went out they monitored

910
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,000
all the sites where they were petroleum

911
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:40,640
fried mighties and what they found was

912
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,690
if you had a patch it was bigger than

913
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:43,639
the front of this room

914
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:46,369
you had that zero probability of ever

915
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:47,960
eradicating it and so he partnered with

916
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:51,140
researchers Derek went on to do a

917
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:53,329
statistical analysis and that really

918
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:56,960
helps guide you know some of the

919
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:59,390
management perfecting because we know we

920
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,500
have a huge stretch pregnant we're not

921
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:04,358
there really here it is

922
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:08,000
that's our goal we should change our

923
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:09,679
objectives it isn't there we're going

924
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,989
with a we reached our goal we can't know

925
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,250
by the mountains we only know whether

926
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:15,618
the thing that we're helping to protect

927
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,929
later Jillian are there so we need to

928
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:20,960
start thinking about how how we measure

929
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:23,210
success and we've been partnering with

930
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,639
state parks and eroding researchers

931
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:28,099
Department this is actually a table with

932
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:30,500
from Sydney SUNY Cortland she's been

933
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:32,390
helping state parks to measure whether

934
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,039
there's halt or control is ineffective

935
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:37,469
and so they did you know they sermon

936
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,759
she's going out helping them see whether

937
00:42:37,469 --> 00:42:41,269
they're actually reaching their goals

938
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,250
whether they should continue doing that

939
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:46,199
we've also mentioned a lot of species

940
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,780
and it's really hard to make decisions

941
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:50,669
about which of those species we should

942
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,820
manage in which of those we should not

943
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:56,039
manage and so we've been working with

944
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,710
some computer scientists and with dr.

945
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:01,230
Angela fuller and I doubt we've hired at

946
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:04,349
the site Jenny price that reduces the

947
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:06,090
effective interns and they are

948
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:07,710
developing taking all of this

949
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:09,750
information in try to develop a model

950
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:13,050
living help guide our decision-making

951
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:17,309
and help us optimize our our invasive

952
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:19,140
species management in our state Research

953
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:20,929
Institute since we've been working with

954
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:24,299
researchers a lot of them Eric Cornell

955
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:26,460
to promote they're getting funding and

956
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:30,060
to promote them working on a new

957
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,980
biological control agents for for some

958
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:34,679
of our most problematic species you guys

959
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,809
may have heard of our quit Wars by over

960
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:39,960
12 chemical the intelligent lab here at

961
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:41,670
Cornell that's been a really growing

962
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,789
program as I mentioned in part of our

963
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:46,930
rental conservation and he also recently

964
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:50,829
released for the first time yes

965
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:53,889
an insect from the Ukraine that was a

966
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:54,369
roof for swallow biocontrol here in New

967
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:57,608
York State

968
00:43:54,369 --> 00:44:00,099
um we're also developing biofuels here

969
00:43:57,608 --> 00:44:01,838
in NYC laughs she's controlled water

970
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:05,230
chestnut which is a very problematic

971
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:08,259
aquatic species and also frenemies it's

972
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:11,289
a once and hoping each other but once

973
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:13,960
you get and I like to buy we control the

974
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:16,329
rest of it it starts working for itself

975
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,250
and it reduces the population that's

976
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:20,680
where native species can come back soon

977
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:23,858
destroying it early it's on so if you

978
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:26,039
get the right match then it actually

979
00:44:23,858 --> 00:44:27,969
leaves a sustainable solution

980
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,429
another issue that we've been working

981
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:32,769
with I mentioned how climate change is

982
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:36,068
impacting invasive spreads but one of

983
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:38,259
the things that come that we don't

984
00:44:36,068 --> 00:44:40,088
really know we don't know how we can

985
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:42,940
incorporate that knowledge into our

986
00:44:40,088 --> 00:44:45,730
management plans and so even in the

987
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:48,608
executive order that was the appendix

988
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:51,940
the exact order Medusa species lamenting

989
00:44:48,608 --> 00:44:53,469
the we conserve languaging a species

990
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,019
management what we were attending to

991
00:44:53,469 --> 00:44:57,789
that so we developed on the northeast

992
00:44:56,019 --> 00:45:00,190
regional basis and climate change

993
00:44:57,789 --> 00:45:02,920
management initiative together with the

994
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,559
North Island Science Center and -

995
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,090
Beverly

996
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:07,309
but we've been really running together

997
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:10,120
researchers and managers in taking them

998
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:13,429
even in helping guide people to do that

999
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:15,259
we've also been working with researchers

1000
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:17,569
to share information on the new

1001
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,160
technologies for early detection so we

1002
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:22,519
coordinated a workshop effective date a

1003
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:25,460
lot and also for date on environmental

1004
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:28,570
DNA wall support anyone on remote

1005
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:31,340
detective education State Lisa species

1006
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:33,230
and then we also were to solicit and

1007
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:36,500
synthesize expert opinions and make

1008
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:39,099
recommendations to the council or to to

1009
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,539
the the GC and other management

1010
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:44,059
management leaders in the state about

1011
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:46,279
what the science is saying so they could

1012
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:48,889
include that in their science in their

1013
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,690
decision-making then finally kind of my

1014
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:53,269
favorite part of it all is this idea

1015
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:55,309
that information is going to be the

1016
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:57,409
solution and the judgment of the

1017
00:45:55,309 --> 00:45:59,779
National ISA species counselor is out

dr. Chaiken reducer fruits pictured

1019
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:07,220
there and she really has promoted

1020
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:09,500
listening across across disciplines

1021
00:46:07,219 --> 00:46:11,480
listed outside the box with the British

1022
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,769
solution they have an Innovation Summit

1023
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,190
about a year and a half

1024
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:17,900
I guess and I believe they're like here

1025
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,700
at Cornell and there are universities is

1026
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,920
a place where a lot of activation to

1027
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:23,569
happen so it's really exciting to to

1028
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,420
think about their solutions

1029
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:28,640
and I guess that's you know among the to

1030
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:32,510
include basic uses well they really see

1031
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:35,960
that as a as a little America in helping

1032
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:38,180
us early advanced Excel Anza district on

1033
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,920
your only time if you're looking for

1034
00:46:38,179 --> 00:46:42,919
things that you would like to do to

1035
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,840
reduce invasive species spread enemies

1036
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,970
are in here are you are getting

1037
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:50,000
generated some there's always needs to

1038
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:52,399
do volunteer days you can learn to

1039
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,400
identify some cases an interim into the

1040
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,320
database they should clean drain and dry

1041
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,220
you put a look fresh she thought so

1042
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:02,809
you're not sprays and a fitness another

1043
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:04,849
duck town we would be happy to know you

1044
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:08,269
plant because species in your garden or

1045
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:10,670
something in here a garden store so

1046
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:13,280
that's have it thank you so much

1047
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:15,760
that hopefully will make music species

1048
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,760
people back

1049
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,999
[Applause]

1050
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:31,599
maybe one or two questions if we had a

1051
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,599
boat we can use up for our next

[Music]

1055
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,490
so we're testing

1056
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:11,549
[Music]

1057
00:50:14,989 --> 00:50:18,139
[Music]

1058
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:33,730
and researchers they're having success

1059
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:35,440
and only know about the vibratory was

1060
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:39,429
issued a lot of patients visiting so

1061
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:42,400
long to actually establish my position

1062
00:50:39,429 --> 00:50:44,980
in the wild an initiative in American

1063
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,130
custody together published but from what

1064
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,130
I've heard

1065
00:50:50,389 --> 00:50:53,489
[Music]

1066

[Music]

1068
00:51:08,429 --> 00:51:14,879
yeah that's bad

1069
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:22,659
[Music]

1070
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:24,630
so they survived the winter so we're

1071
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:30,129
optimistic

1072
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:33,239
population here ten years
