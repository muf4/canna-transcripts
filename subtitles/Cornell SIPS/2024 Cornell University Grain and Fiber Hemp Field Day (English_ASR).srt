1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,519
University okay morning welcome

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,518
everyone my name is Larry smart I'm a

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,320
professor in the horiculture section in

5
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:24,640
the school of vgr plant science this

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,920
year just to give you an overview of the

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,679
agenda and you we did print out I did

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,880
print out enough hard copies of the

9
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:35,519
agenda for everyone but uh there is a QR

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,679
code that will take you online and we

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,640
have the agenda and all of our handouts

12
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,920
are online uh because we do that because

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,558
I used to print out 125 or 150 handouts

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,679
and end up with 100 left over at the end

15
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:53,640
uh so we do have 25 hard copy printouts

16
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,359
of our handouts and we'll be

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,960
Distributing those as each speaker comes

18
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,320
up to the mic and if you do want to look

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,640
at a hard copy hand out you know share

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,118
and look over uh each other's

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,799
shoulders uh so in the morning we are

22
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:12,200
going to talk about this uh we're going

23
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,520
to start with uh our update from New

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,960
York State agon markets uh Tim sweey

25
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,959
who's our program director and then uh

26
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:24,438
we will talk about this variety

27
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:27,199
trial and then we will uh shift down to

28
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:30,039
uh the next stop and talk about some

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,920
establishment management techniques uh

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:37,479
seed treatments weed management and

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,280
rolling uh and then uh hopefully the

32
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:43,000
Bish fiber cut is

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,960
running uh and we will see how well

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,519
that's

35
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:51,478
working so uh then we're going to move

36
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:54,679
on uh Magic Kowalski is here from Poland

37
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,438
he's going to talk about uh some of the

38
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,520
different aspects of

39
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:00,718
reading uh in particular for textile

40
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,319
fiber

41
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,118
quality then we will have a pretty cool

42
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,840
demo of a Monarch Electric

43
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:12,639
tractor and uh finally we'll end up the

44
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,280

45
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,359
uh

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,479
so then we will all drive down to our

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,000
new hemp processing facility that we

48
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:25,799
call the hemp tent it's a fabric barn

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,919
and uh we will have a delicious Rusty

50
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,959
Pig lunch uh in the hemp tent and in the

51
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,878
afternoon we will see if we can get our

52
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:38,878
decorticator running and then we'll end

53
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:41,598
the day with an array of uh hemp

54
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,878
industry professionals and entrepreneurs

55
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:46,759
from New York

56
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:48,560
State uh so I hope uh I hope it's a

57
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:51,039
stimulating event we have a lot of

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,680
people from across the country here

59
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:58,079
attending uh academics industry members

60
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,200
uh processing folks uh so it should be a

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,239
nice networking event

62
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:08,518
uh uh let me just the last thing I want

63
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,080
to say is that everything may not go

64
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,239
great uh we've broken a lot of stuff in

65
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,640
the last week and have been scrambling

66
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,080
especially my new research support

67
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,158
specialist Jacob Bish has been putting

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,000
in long hours uh trying to get things

69
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:26,719
repaired in time for

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,719
today they may not work perfectly uh but

71
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:34,239
it will be real so it may not be great

72
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,840
but it will be real and uh that reflects

73
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,239
where we are in the hemp industry right

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,878
now especially on the processing side uh

75
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:47,598
so bear with us uh if you have some

76
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:50,679
suggestions to make things work let us

77
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:53,878
know okay I'm going to uh hand over the

78
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,680
mic uh to our longstanding and good

79
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,280
friend at New York State agon markets

80
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,680
they have been incredibly supportive of

81
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,239
our research programs

82
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,760
and uh but Tim is is also manages our

83
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,438
hemp Growers and he's going to give you

84
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,878
a little update and uh answer any

85
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,878
questions you have

86
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,319
Tim so I'll be the first thing that may

87
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,439
not work

88
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:26,399
great my presentation's on a PowerPoint

89
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:28,000
we have no screen so um that's okay so

90
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,560
we've been running the hemp licensing

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,240
program since uh 22 it's the current

92
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,038
iteration of it it's no longer a pilot

93
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,000
program and uh we are granted that

94
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:43,439
Authority by the USDA hemp Still Remains

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,759
a heavily regulated crop and you must be

96
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,079
licensed by the state in order to grow

97
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,919
it the license fee is $500 and you have

98
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:56,240
to have a FBI background check you can

99
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:59,319
have no uh felony drug related

100
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,478
convictions within the last 10 years uh

101
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:02,839
in order to get a license if you do you

102
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:05,560
would be

103
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:09,159
disqualified um I don't want to take a

104
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,439
lot of time going through the minutia of

105
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,919
the program because I don't think

106
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:15,199
there's probably a lot of Growers here

107
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:17,198
Larry U sorry I'm here with Chuck

108
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,800
Schmidt my colleague somewhere around

109
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,800
we'll be here all day so if you have any

110
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,600
particular questions if you are a grower

111
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,400
you can hunt us down and we will talk to

112
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,160
you oneon-one

113
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,560
um if you are a license grower

114
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,880
there's some things that you need to

115
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,560
remember if you are haven't yet done a

116
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,159
planting report you need to get that

117
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,720
into us they have to be in by the end of

118
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,720
the year um they're supposed to be in

119
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,479
within 20 days of planting even if

120
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,560
you're not planting you still have to do

121
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,439
it there's a box to check that says

122
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,240
you're not planting but if you don't get

123
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,639
it into US you run the risk of having to

124
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,360
enter into a a corrective action plan

125
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,160
which is just a lot more paperwork for

126
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,800
you so you don't want to do that um also

127
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,479
if you a grower and you're about to

128
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,160
Harvest you need to submit a pre harvest

129
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,680
report with us they need to be sent in

130
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,800
30 days before your intended harvest

131
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,720
date and then you would uh on that form

132
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,319
you would choose your sampling agent and

133
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,360
a lab that will do your testing for you

134
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,879
we no longer do the sampling and testing

135
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,120
as an agency we just don't have the

136
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:25,598
capacity so that is the Grower's

137
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,680
responsibility we have uh 28 I believe

138
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:32,439
certified sampling agents and 24

139
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,240
recognized lb that you can uh work with

140
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:35,240
to fill those

141
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:45,560
responsibilities sorry about

142
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,160
this so uh the Grower's license is good

143
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,000
for three years that's the $500 fee you

144
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,439
pay is is good for a three-year license

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,759
and since the program started in 2022

146
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,038
that means that licenses are going to be

147
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,360
expiring next year they'll start to

148
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:03,360
expire if you're a grower you'll be

149
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,960
getting a 90-day advanced notice that

150
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,759
you need to get your license renewed we

151
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,758
will be doing individualized

152
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,720
notification to everybody as their

153
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,680
license comes up 90 days out and

154
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,919
unfortunately I checked with the

155
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,759
USDA you do have to do another

156
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,598
background check for the new license the

157
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,879
background check can be no more than 60

158
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:27,279
days old when you apply when you send in

159
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,759
your application applications have to be

160
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,038
mailed in they can't be taken

161
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,479
electronically

162
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:36,360
for some reason they W let us do that

163
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,359
there's another $500 fee for the

164
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,879
renewal and this is uh these are just

165
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,919
caveats that I say every year if you're

166
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,479
planning to grow hemp know where you're

167
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,279
going to sell the hemp have a market

168
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,758
before you plant the stuff we have

169
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,598
people every year they plant it then

170
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,120
they call us at Harvest Time what am I

171
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:00,918
going to do with this we don't broker

172
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,639
hemp we don't have a way to set you up

173
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:06,198
with Buyers so know where you're going

174
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,519
to sell it before you plant also zoning

175
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,240
is a local issue in New York state check

176
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,478
the zoning where you're going to grow

177
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,400
you can't grow in a residential area

178
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,719
unless it's also zoned for agricultural

179
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,198
uses you can't grow in a

180
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,680
residence or an attached

181
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,120
garage know the characteristics of the

182
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,079
plant you're growing of the varieties

183
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,240
you're growing if it's got a tendency to

184
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,399
go hot stay away from it cuz if it's if

185
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,599
it goes hot it's not going to be any

186
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,000
good to you you'll have to destroy it or

187
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,200
remediate it in some way and the

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,158
remediation pretty much makes it

189
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,120
invaluable or not of any

190
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:46,759
value and because we have we're still

191
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,240
operating under the 2018 farm bill we

192
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:53,278
have not had a new farm bill yet the 0.3

193
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,839
total THC Remains the standard for the

194
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,439
for industrial hemp no more than

195
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,519
3% we were hoping for a farm bill last

196
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,760
year I don't think we're going to get

197
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,560
one this year so we'll see if uh next

198
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,600
year if we get a farm bill perhaps there

199
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,319
will be some changes I haven't heard of

200
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,360
anything

201
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,839
coming so uh or any changes coming and I

202
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,200
haven't heard of any progress on the

203
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,959
farm bill

204
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,360
so if anybody have any questions now I

205
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,879
can take them or we can wait till later

206
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,959
does New York exempt certified varieties

207
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:29,360
from compliance testing we have a list

208
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:32,559
of varieties yes that that um are exist

209
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,560
Ed from from

210
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:39,680
testing and there's

211
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:42,720
uh you have the potential of being uh

212
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:45,159
inspected once every once in your

213
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,879
three-year period you will be inspected

214
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:50,000
sometimes more the testing can uh the

215
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,480
sampling certain varieties can be

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,078
Exempted from it others will not if they

217
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,000
have a tendency to be kind of hot if

218
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,879
they've

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,320
been um hot in the past you're going to

220
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:01,320
have to sample those

221
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:08,000
when do you sample for compliance

222
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:09,360
testing how many days har so if the

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,399
question is when do we sample for

224
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,120
compliance testing 30 days out from your

225
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,879
anticipated date of harvest send in your

226
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,839
pre harvest report with the name of your

227
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:23,278
sampling agent we then um generate a uh

228
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,200
chain of custody

229
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:26,759
form that would get sent to your

230
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,759
sampling agent and they would call you

231
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:32,000
you'd set up your sampling date so it's

232
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:35,240
30 days out uh from your anticipated

233
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,240
Harvest is when the sample's

234
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,879
taken the question is is a total THC yes

235
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,879
it's total

236
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,199
THC any other

237
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,879
questions great like I said Chuck and I

238
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,399
are here most all day so hunt us down if

239
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,240
you have other questions I have I have

240
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,240
one

241
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:11,360
too uh so if if a field uh exceeds test

242
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,440
hot exceeds the 0.3%

243
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,200
limit uh you have the option to

244
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,839
remediate it and retest it right uh one

245
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,120
of my colleagues told me that that

246
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,560
remediation retesting and Remediation

247
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:29,919
does not apply if you were growing or

248
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,919
seed for planting is that true

249
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:40,439
you always do

250
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:43,199
this Chuck I would say SE crops

251
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,920
generally don't go hot most of the CBD

252
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,920
crops what we'

253
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:52,360
seen so so we did have a seed crop go

254
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:55,879
hot last year right and we we did we did

255
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,360
let him Harvest that and and so so that

256
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,000
I think we probably would take that on a

257
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,959
Case by case basis and see what

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,440
varieties they're talking about how hot

259
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:08,679
it is um you know we

260
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,200
were to remediate

261
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:14,000
it have to chop it up pretty much and

262
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,320
make it a homogeneous mess and the seed

263
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,039
would have been lost and we didn't want

264
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,320
that to happen so

265
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:23,679
uh we did allow that to to go okay you

266
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,320
we're not we're trying to

267
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,239
not we want people to be successful we

268
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,320
don't we don't want we don't want uh to

269
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,799
to get

270
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:38,399
people unnecessarily in trouble or have

271
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:40,639
to destroy their crop for for uh minut

272
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,159
problems but we we are beholding to the

273
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,360
USDA if we get audited and we have

274
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:46,120
something wrong we could it could

275
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,399
threaten the whole proam

276
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,799
so so yeah and you also like I said it's

277
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:52,320
make sure you're not you're not growing

278
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,319
varieties that tend to go hot because if

279
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,440
a field is hot it it will have to be

280
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,320
destroyed if it can't be remediated and

281
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,600
and and if you haven't sent in your

282
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,160
planting your pre harvest report you've

283
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:09,079
harvested it without it being sampled it

284
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,078
will be destroyed and you turn it

285
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,240
into

286
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,480
valeries you mean if it tests hot it

287
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,799
tests hot can you use the material as a

288
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,800
source for biochar for champ yeah if you

289
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:27,519
could whatever you do with the biochar

290
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,759
to make to make the the hemp

291
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:34,360
irretrievable and and no you know not

292
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:36,559
useable B illicit purposes yeah yeah I

293
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,879
think that'd be

294
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,879
okay okay a question what is your means

295
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,759
of

296
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,078
remediation what is the means of

297
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,759
remediation Chuck you want to handle

298
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:48,759
that one

299
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:56,198
yeah thank you yeah for remediation we

300
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,000
generally ask that the the power be

301
00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:59,958
removed and then the remainder of the

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,399
drop be chopped up a

303
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:04,958
biomass um the flour can be chopped up

304
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,679
in that as well so you delute it with

305
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,119
all the leaf material and all the stem

306
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,000
material and then we send another sample

307
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,159
to the lab and most likely it's going to

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,720
be tested fine the problem is now you

309
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,240
have this product you have to

310
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,600
sell right what do you do with that I'm

311
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,879
not sure you have like a window of days

312
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,720
that has to be remediated yeah like

313
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:29,198
anything else you know once we find it

314
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,600
hot we got uh 10 days to tell us what we

315
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:35,198
do with it I talk to you talk about some

316
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,800
of the options that you have

317
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:40,599
ch a market for that cuz then you have

318
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,919
to get retested at your expense so you

319
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,079
want to throw good money up your bad if

320
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:47,679
you don't have a a use for it then it's

321
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:47,679
better just the

322
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,639
top okay okay great thanks very much Kim

want to see Farmers

331
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,838
succeed

332
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:26,599
uh but having said that evaluating the

333
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:29,079
cultiv ours that you're growing and uh

334
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,720
uh I would my advice would be to grow

335
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:34,799
compliant cultivars uh cultivars that

336
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,720
have a long history of being compliant

337
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,758
under the current rules uh so that is

338
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,879
something that we have been doing in our

339
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:46,240
field trials for the last s years is

340
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:48,439
evaluating varieties testing them for

341
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,959
compliance and doing the fundamental

342
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,839
research to understand the genetics of

343
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:57,399
why those varieties produce uh THC and I

344
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:01,279
think we've been pretty successful at

345
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:04,198
that uh it is now really critical that

346
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:07,198
you grow compliant varieties if you want

347
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:10,919
to enter hemp seed meal into the animal

348
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:14,439
feed market so that has been an

349
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:16,719
incredible uh event in the hemp industry

350
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,680
is federal approval AFCO and FDA

351
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,160
approval of hemp seed meal as a feed

352
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,638
ingredient for laying

353
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:27,600
hem with the caveat being that that feed

354
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:31,039
definition has some pretty low limits

355
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,959
for THC and CB BD so that hemp seed meal

356
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,599
cannot have greater than two parts per

357
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,559
million t total

358
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,959
THC or more than 20 parts per million

359
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,479
total

360
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:44,239
CBD uh obviously those seeds are not

361
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,000
making THC it would be residue that

362
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,440
would be rubbing off in the bin of the

363
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,399
combine or through the harvesting

364
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,720
process uh but right from the outset you

365
00:16:53,399 --> 00:17:00,000
want to be growing varieties that

366
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,199
produce low amounts of THC

367
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,838
uh this year you're going to see that

368
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:10,000
our field day is really focused on

369
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:12,078
fiber and a lot of those fiber varieties

370
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,599
do produce

371
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:17,000
THC uh so that's not an issue for the

372
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,000
hemp seed meal

373
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,359
obviously uh but but it's something that

374
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,359
my graduate student Luis monserat is

375
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,438
going to talk

376
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:30,199
about uh so Lis is going to give you

377
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:34,320
about a 15minute overview uh of uh 15 or

378
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:37,000
20 minute overview of his research uh

379
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,918
and the trial behind me here and then we

380
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,480
want to give you some time to walk

381
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:44,160
through the trial ask any questions

382
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,240
follow up with Luise on things that he's

383
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,320
saying and uh

384
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,839
then we are going to meet at that

385
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:54,879
speaker over

386
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:56,959
there uh

387
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,000
at uh

388
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,840
9:50 right okay okay so Luis it's all

389
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,839
yours thank you Larry hi everyone great

390
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:11,119
to see you all again uh many familiar

391
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:13,678
faces uh great great attendance is that

392
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,879
okay perfect uh so I always ask this

393
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:22,600
question when I give my talk who in here

394
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,600
is wearing or has any ham fiber piece of

395
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:30,960
clothing oh lower than last year that's

396
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,720
unfortunate um if you ever need a good

397
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,679
hat I would highly recommend this hat by

398
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:40,120
Ty or til I believe 100% H fiber so I

399
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,038
will encourage the industry once again

400
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:45,158
um yeah so my name is l mate I'm studed

401
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:48,158
my fourth year in my in this PhD program

402
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:49,880
with Larry uh focusing on fiber and

403
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,919
grain breeding and

404
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:56,480
genetics uh and you know as you saw last

405
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,159
like yesterday uh the USDA

406
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,519
characterization of General plasm is

407
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:01,880
important right so in order to do any of

408
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,240
the breeding in generics we need to

409
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,360
explore these cultiv we need to

410
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,839
characterize them I want to characterize

411
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,079
phenotypically and genotypically so

412
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,639
right now I want to show you my

413
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:13,399
phenotypic characterization here so this

414
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:18,520
characterization is not new it has been

415
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:22,400
done for many years uh um if I want to

416
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:24,879
if I'm not mistaken a century ago uh

417
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,559
list to do it started doing this in

418
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,400
1920s

419
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:31,200
1922 I believe uh uh and he started

420
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,759
characterizing General plasm from Italy

421
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,480
from China um and started introgressing

422
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:38,400
some of those traits in um the that

423
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,919
Geral

424
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,320
plasm uh in the Netherlands in 1994 they

425
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:48,038
did something similar assessing 163

426
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:52,918
accessions um and that was a multide

427
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:55,919
trial in 2020 I believe they assessed

428
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,080
123 accessions uh the same university

429
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,000
vaging university and they did an

430
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,480
international assessment comparing

431
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,240
performance in the Netherlands in Italy

432
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,400
and in France so this is not new but

433
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,079
this is very imperative uh to know how

434
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,120
how the cultiv performs and what are the

435
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:16,480
interesting traits there are so again

436
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:18,239
character is important at the USDA you

437
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,880
saw very cool traits if you walk around

438
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,880
the field you saw certain uh interesting

439
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,960
phenotypes certain traits certain Le

440
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,799
certain in fluoresence and certain Mishi

441
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,279
that was very interesting um so that's

442
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:31,158
what we are seeing here we're also

443
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,599
assessing that in a production scale

444
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,400
instead of a high plant density how the

445
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:39,359
per how the cul will perform in a

446
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,320
commercial setting uh to do that uh we

447
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:46,079
decided to do a dual on is on your right

448
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:50,240
side and a fiber that is on your left

449
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:55,240
side um uh the the fiber was planted at

450
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:58,839
a density of um 1.87 million plants per

451
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,839
acre I believe

452
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:10,439
[Music]

453
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,959
1.31 million plant per acre and the duo

454
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,719
was of 180,000 plant per acre uh I'm

455
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,278
sorry I I use metric units I'm trying to

456
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:26,759
convert to the uh imperial system um

457
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:29,599
yeah so as you can see uh the stand

458
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:31,359
count is very important important for us

459
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,399
because for fiber we want to minimize

460
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,839
the stem diameter so uh we have heard

461
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,038
from processors that they don't want

462
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,599
something that is thicker than an inch

463
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:43,119
uh or something that is you know uh the

464
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:45,158
diameter of a pinky uh and for the Dual

465
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,879
what we want is to maximiz the her

466
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,039
production as well as the grain

467
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,278
production so we should we should

468
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,879
actually uh enable that branchiness or a

469
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:57,359
little bit of branchiness for the um

470
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,919
yield of of fiber sorry of

471
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:03,278
grain um but I think it is important to

472
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,559
know that there are advantages and

473
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:07,960
disadvantages based on the type of

474
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:09,639
cultiv that you use the market classes

475
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,240
that you use so I would like to discuss

476
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,240
with you about

477
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:24,839
that for example um there are two sexual

478
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:27,400
difference uh what can I say uh

479
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,278
expressions in cannabis uh there is the

480
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,919
the isues and the mon isues

481
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:35,079
so if we have a daous crop uh there are

482
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:39,600
advantages and disadvantages with it one

483
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:41,558
D that is has has been uh approved and

484
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,278
corroborated well I want say approved

485
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:48,278
sorry corroborated by um a group in

486
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:51,038
Italy from 2022 I believe they observe

487
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:53,919
that male plants have a higher fiber

488
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:56,480
quality than female plants so in that

489
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,400
case when you have a daous population

490
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,558
then uh before the females flower you

491
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,159
objectively speaking will should get

492
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:07,519
better fiber yield now this assessment

493
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,240
has not been done comparing such yeld

494
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,839
with amonous and it makes it challenging

495
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,919
because you have to ensure you have the

496
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:19,439
same genotypic background except the

497
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,559
sexual differentiation right so but uh

498
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,480
for now we can say that in population

499
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:24,440
the males at least will have a higher

500
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,319
fiber

501
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,558
quality with the montias the idea is

502
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:32,639
that that quality should be more

503
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,079
homogeneous if you will right CU it will

504
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,720
be the same individual however if you

505
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:38,678
walk around and you see a demolicious

506
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,079
individual there will be a few males

507
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,320
over there it's it's typical to see

508
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:44,839
between 5 to 10% of the population

509
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:48,240
having

510
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:50,278
males uh another important um

511
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,880
characteristic with the Monas and the

512
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:55,159
isos is the east of

513
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:57,278
harvest um if you have a the populations

514
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:00,200
and you harvest for

515
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:02,119
grain that that would be at se maturity

516
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,558
by that time in aous population the

517
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:09,399
males will be sess and will be Reddit so

518
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:12,480
it is probable that that male will clog

519
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,640
your combine and I heard that before and

520
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,200
and sometime happens sometime you wraps

521
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,200
up and starts heating up in the combine

522
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,360
uh smoking and stuff so it could be a

523
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,440
challenge uh so that's why sometimes

524
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,719
montias is

525
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,320
better now if you look at the Monisha

526
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,960
individual I know I acknowledge there

527
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,038
are different types of Mishi there's

528
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,038
there are different uh inflorescence

529
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:35,278
types when you talk about mishas but the

530
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:37,759
European mishas in my in my opinion has

531
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:39,720
these clusters of male flowers that

532
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,000
eventually sess and they stay on the

533
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,480
female

534
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,919
plant uh so this is decaying material in

535
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,038
the inflorescence where the grains are

536
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,000
going to be harvested for human

537
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,720
consumption consumption are going to be

538
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,599
so that that is a little micro

539
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,440
environment for a potential pathogen

540
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:57,639
growth and uh some maybe some of you

541
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,080
know if you have ferum garum there you

542
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,159
may have omx in there so I don't know if

543
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,119
that would be the case but it's a

544
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,960
hypothesis I have that that could be a

545
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:08,639
potential um issue with amous individual

546
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,038
in that

547
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,240
sense

548
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:17,038
um the other question that I have about

549
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,200
the differences uh or a trade-off is

550
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,440
grain yield uh and again we have to

551
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,679
ensure that we have the same genotypic

552
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:28,320
background except the sexual expression

553
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:31,000
but are mous plants uh producing more ye

554
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,599
field than A's

555
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,720
population uh I mean you would think so

556
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:39,599
right because you have more than uh 50%

557
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,399
of the plants being

558
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:45,519
um uh female if you have a malicious

559
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:47,759
population you are objectively have more

560
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,798
grain but it's something that that we

561
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,480
need to assess because there are many

562
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:54,440
compounder factors such as late

563
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,319
flowering branchiness but that's another

564
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,080
thing to consider maybe malicious if the

565
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,599
plant is you know typically identical

566
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:03,480
but is mous maybe has more grain I

567
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:05,319
believe that uh new genetics has kind of

568
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,759
like that dra of thought a little bit

569
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:12,678
with their uh one of their uh

570
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:14,640
hybrids another parameter or important

571
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,960
trait that we characterize and we try to

572
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,480
make sense of is the flowering time and

573
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,798
there are advantages and disadvantages

574
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,079
with them and I would like to discuss

575
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:25,240
those with

576
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:27,558
you um so for fiber what do we want a

577
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,839
late flowering right because we want to

578
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:31,798
accumulate as much stock as possible

579
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,079
however during the Pennsylvania field

580
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:36,000
day I was told that for a specific

581
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,079
processor they don't want more than four

582
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,200
to six ft tall

583
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,558
plants um so I don't

584
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,480
know uh

585
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:50,119
but if you have a taller stem you will

586
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,960
have more Bast running along the the

587
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:53,918
main

588
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,519
stem um obviously you start getting more

589
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,600
hurt but when you have a l flower you're

590
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:02,759
able to uh accumulate that vegetative

591
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,480
growth over time accumulate more vast

592
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,480
you have an early flower in one that

593
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,960
would not be the

594
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,960
case uh another interesting thing is the

595
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,798
east of harvest when we looking at early

596
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:18,278
and late flowering if you have a late

597
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,038
flowering uh for grain for example that

598
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:21,720
plant will be very big that you need

599
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,720
very expensive and very difficult to

600
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,000
obtain piece of equipment such as the H

601
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,240
flx double cut right if you want to have

602
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,278
a dual purpose but if you have an early

603
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,640
flowering you need a regular combine

604
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:36,919
that you can you know easily

605
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:42,600
Harvest um for the fiber uh you may need

606
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:45,640
a fiber cut or um a s bar shouldn't be a

607
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:47,439
problem um but I think that you need to

608
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,000
reach certain height for that to work

609
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,278
cuz you going to have four bars on that

610
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,440
uh fire

611
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:58,278
C you can just use the T

612
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:01,399
Bar um One Challenge that we have OB

613
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:03,919
serve is the scal UPS late flowering

614
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:05,959
cultivars and early flowering also is a

615
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,440
very important step over very important

616
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,480
characteristic for us as a breed

617
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,558
breeders to to

618
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,919
utilize uh to scale up breeding lines or

619
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,200
cultivar if we have a late flower in

620
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:19,080
cultivar it makes it really challenging

621
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,960
to produce seeds here because by the

622
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:24,119
time that the seeds are maturing we have

623
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,079
a frost and we lose all our our seed so

624
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,158
makes it very difficult when you flower

625
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,000
very late so then we have to play with

626
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,480
other characteristic either okay we can

627
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,079
grow at Southern latitudes okay but you

628
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,120
know Florida there's a hurricane

629
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,079
everything goes to hell

630
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,759
right so it makes it very very difficult

631
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:42,398
uh however there are other parameters

632
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:44,359
that we can look into such as the

633
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,798
juvenile face of the plant we have

634
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:52,519
observed that certain germoplasm once

635
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:55,398
it's grown a very um at a very low sorry

636
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:57,278
short day length it will take a while to

637
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:59,879
flower it wouldn't flower like in two

638
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:04,278
weeks some do some do in two weeks but

639
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,080
some will take a month 20 days 6 weeks

640
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:08,398
and that is very good because he allow

641
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,798
us to have a growth that is big enough

642
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,639
for a regular combine to use when it's

643
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:17,079
growing in so we can grow in Yuma

644
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:19,278
Arizona in uh November SE uh December so

645
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:21,079
it makes it it's a good environment for

646
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,200
it but not all cultivat perform that way

647
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:26,439
so we need to assess General plasm to

648
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,080
see that juvenile face or that um

649
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:33,360
sensitivity to the critical

650
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:35,480
Dayland and just a little um sidebar

651
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,678
here when you're looking at Dayland I

652
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,159
will encourage you to include the Civil

653
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,559
Twilight in your measurements Civil

654
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,159
Twilight also uh prevents flowering uh

655
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:47,398
there's a group out of University of

656
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,440
Florida uh observe this and reported

657
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:53,398
this and I have been able to track down

658
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,320
and accurately uh compare my uh day

659
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:57,079
length from the field into a grow

660
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:58,240
chamber and I have observed those so I

661
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:59,639
would encourage you that whenever you're

662
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,000
doing measurement using day length

663
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,000
included C Twilight um

664
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:13,079
time we competition is another important

665
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:15,839
um phenotype to look into for our

666
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:18,158
general plasm and that would be probably

667
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,359
late to early flowering but I would I

668
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,080
would say that seiling Viger and leaf

669
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:24,558
area is another important parameter for

670
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,759
the week competition so we

671
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,519
want uh General platform that will have

672
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:30,240
a growth rate very high were able to

673
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:31,839
compete with the weeds a leaf area

674
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,880
that's going to be very large that we

675
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:37,839
can a were able to shade those weeds out

676
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,240
and you can see that in some of those

677
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:45,439
like there's no wheed whatsoever uh

678
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:48,159
obviously spray Sunland here um but uh

679
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,038
but last year we did an spray T I

680
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,519
believe and we have a nice we had a very

681
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:58,200
nice um with competition for some

682
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:02,120
cultiv and one an additional tra I'm

683
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,558
looking into uh uh which which I think

684
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:06,678
is very important and for some of you

685
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:10,038
may be more more than obnoxious com this

686
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:14,278
for me is seat size because what we have

687
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:17,398
observed that seed size uh does it it

688
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:19,638
seems to be a higher proxy for sealing

689
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:21,959
Vigor uh at least the general PR that we

690
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:25,278
have used that we have tested with large

691
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,440
seeds have large leaves which allow us

692
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,519
to compete with the

693
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,278
weeds preliminary speaking from a pilot

694
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,079
study that we did uh we have observed

695
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:38,159
that larger seats are able to perform

696
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:41,158
better in processing for de hauling so

697
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,600
that's that's good as well

698
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,120
um but I do acknowledge that the

699
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,480
challenge is when you're getting a pound

700
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,278
of seats you're getting fewer seats

701
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,960
that's a problem that's I understand

702
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:56,159
that but I think that the uh counter

703
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,399
argument for it is that you will

704
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,840
essentially need fewer seats to your

705
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:01,879
establishment because the ceiling is

706
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:04,798
going to be so high when you have lower

707
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,080
seats you need more seats in a bag sorry

708
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,798
you will have more seats in a bag but

709
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:11,240
you will use a lot of those seeds and

710
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:13,000
some of those will be th self thinned uh

711
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,440
or the crop is not going to compete with

712
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,200
the Wheats so what's going to happen in

713
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,880
the Harvest your bells are going to be

714
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,159
full of Wheats which may decrease the

715
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,320
quality and your seeds may have a lot of

716
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:29,278
wheat a lot of uh wheat seeds in

717
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:31,200
it um so I think think sit size should

718
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:32,880
be I mean we have done it with corn so I

719
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,480
think the same thing can be done with

720
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,919
hemp and I think it's a good um try to

721
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,278
explore and I'm constantly exploring but

722
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:47,440
what is the other characteristic of you

723
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:50,319
know hemp or phenotype of yes phenotype

724
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,399
of tra that we C the most I think Tim

725
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:55,240
was very clear about one of them that

726
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:59,119
makes hemp hemp legally

727
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:02,200
speaking the THC so so and that's the

728
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:06,678
perfect Segway for what we are going to

729
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:09,880
uh move on and that is selection for

730
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:13,000
populations breeding lines SL cultivars

731
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:16,960
that will be consistently below the

732
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,798
0.3% THC limit per driveway and that's

733
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,919
what we have done for our bring lines

734
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:23,759
Orsa Alta and Orsa Grande you will see

735
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:27,360
other two here 1380 and

736
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:32,359
1143 um these cultivar Embry lines were

737
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:34,599
actually selected for the production of

738
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:37,398
for the lack of production of THC or to

739
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:38,839
reach a limit below the 0.3 THC so this

740
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:42,558
was done with Market assist selection

741
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:44,678
developed by our lab and uh we are we

742
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,440
can ensure you that when you are growing

743
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:47,639
this cultivar by the time of sampling

744
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,038
and you're harvesting you are not going

745
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:51,199
to exceed that limit and we have

746
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:54,839
consistently observed that have been

747
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,360
certified uh by a third party lab so and

748
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:58,480
we have done the same thing for 1142 and

749
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,719
for

750
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,319
1380 and I will uh encourage you all to

751
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,278
look at the handouts and we can see our

752
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,039
potential yield in a small PL trial and

753
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:10,440
I understand small trial is no a street

754
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,759
trial we're able to reach about 20

755
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,639
metric tons per hectar per yes per

756
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:19,280
hectar which is like eight us tons per

757
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,399
acre uh and for your for your

758
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,440
understanding the average of five yield

759
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:30,519
last year was reported in the USDA

760
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:33,838
um uh hemp report it was two tons per

761
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:35,480
acre so that was the average and for Ura

762
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,878
Grande which is another cultivat in this

763
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,519
case we are promoting this a dual

764
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:43,118
purpose so we can get grain out of it as

765
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:46,960
well as the herd we're able to get um

766
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:50,358
about six metric tons sorry six um us

767
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:54,398
tons per acre and we're able to get

768
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:56,440
2,000 lb per acre of GRA of grain again

769
00:34:54,398 --> 00:35:01,519
the average last year

770
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:03,039
was uh 558 pound per acre so what I'm

771
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:07,519
giving you is numbers that should

772
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:09,639
encourage you to um pursue hemp and

773
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,759
looking into the future and perhaps

774
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:15,920
getting interesting our cul as well uh

775
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,480
but again I think more importantly is to

776
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,920
test this recurrently and to observe

777
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,838
these yields and this uh performance

778
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,039
consistently year after year and not

779
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:29,400
just in the same location but

780
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:31,880
across the uh across the US and in the

781
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,480
handout for our bring you can see also

782
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,880
the yields in Kentucky uh well IA

783
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,920
Kentucky uh North Carolina Texas and

784
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,039
Florida so you with that you can

785
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,559
determine uh what your potential your

786
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:48,559
best cultivate could be uh not just for

787
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:53,000
fiber but also for for

788
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:55,440
grain um one trait that I feel like I'm

789
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,239
I'm forgetting is

790
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,599
the uh the fiber quality one which is

791
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:05,759
bass content this bass content has been

792
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:09,838
improved since 1950s if I'm not

793
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:13,160
mistaken um right now you can see one of

794
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:16,920
those um which is

795
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:19,239
579 uh this was reported well this

796
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,440
yellow stem or bright stem was

797
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:25,159
identified in 1950s if I'm not mistaken

798
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,679
uh by a German group they call it brid

799
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:30,920
stems uh this trait is very interesting

800
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:35,399
because they have observed in

801
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,920
2018 other General plasm I think caralon

802
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,838
iory

803
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:43,639
marant that has produced higher bass

804
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:47,440
content uh after recation compared to uh

805
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:48,118
green stem uh in 20 I think 2023 if I'm

806
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,760
not

807
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:55,119
mistaken um another group assessed the

808
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,720
performance of fiber 79 with Futura 75

809
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,838
and they observe a difference uh well

810
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:05,439
they observed that fi 79 was

811
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:07,920
37.5% B content whereas Futura 75 was

812
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,880
29.3% uh I have seen crazy numbers as

813
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,800
well in all groups uh out of lvia they

814
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,960
upset like over 42% bass content which

815
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,119
is insane but they have done it

816
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,280
allegedly um

817
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,358
so basically what I was trying what I'm

818
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,920
trying to say here is that this

819
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:28,480
characterization of cultiv have allowed

820
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:32,400
all people and have allowed us to

821
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:35,400
improve our um yields to improve the

822
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,240
traits that we believe are going to be

823
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,760
more Adept for the industry as well as

824
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:44,639
for Growers processors uh industry in

825
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,119
general and I think that um we are

826
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,838
getting that we're heading that way and

827
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:50,838
we have more ring lines in the pipeline

828
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:53,799
trying to assess to ensure that we are

829
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:56,759
not exing the limits for hand seat meal

830
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,800
to have high seat size or great seat

831
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,000
size uh to ensure a uniform flower in

832
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,240
time to make sure that we have that

833
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,519
parameter of distinct um uniform and

834
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:10,039
stable to meet as a cultiv so that we

835
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:12,880
can have that certification of

836
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:15,519
seeds and

837
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:20,358
um yeah I guess this is all I had to say

838
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,358
and those are my 15 minutes so

839
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,480
yeah I'm sorry

840
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:34,039
that does not go

841
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,000
hot our our none of our varieties are

842
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:41,599
essentially zero THC they will not go

843
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,719
hot and uh our varieties will be

844
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,599
submitted uh for plant variety

845
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:46,598
protection this

846
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:52,760
fall I have another question yeah go

847
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,720
ahead so when is the right stage to

848
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,400
harvest for example like fiber type and

849
00:38:55,719 --> 00:39:00,399
also have dual purpose type so

850
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,318
when is the good time to harvest before

851
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,440
flowering or yeah uh the question is

852
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:08,440
what's the best time to harvest for

853
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,280
Fiverr and Dual Purpose uh fers so for

854
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:15,559
Fiverr it has been wildly researched for

855
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:18,800
many years uh in Europe um the ideal

856
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:21,880
time to maximize yield and minimize

857
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,200
quality uh quality loss and that is at

858
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,160
the onset of female flowering so you are

859
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:29,759
able to have those uh to stretch out

860
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:31,440
your your your your height your stem

861
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,160
length as much as possible but

862
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,599
minimizing the lfic that happens uh

863
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,000
during flowering F flowering so that

864
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,359
would be the time so what I do is

865
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,119
because I do not immediately believe

866
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:46,960
that every single cultiv is 50/50 I just

867
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:50,240
rate uh percentage of flowering overall

868
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,159
and whenever I see at least 50%

869
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,479
flowering in my population I decid that

870
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:57,000
that's time to harvest for fiber for a

871
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,599
dual purpose um so it is interesting

872
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,039
because have more issues and the issues

873
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:05,079
and I have to have a a Criterion that

874
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:07,719
will fit both of them so what I do is uh

875
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:10,039
I rate flowering again on a weekly basis

876
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:12,318
once I reach 80% flowering that will

877
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:13,960
ensure that for a manous population most

878
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:16,159
of them are flowering and for other

879
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,280
issues I have more than half of the

880
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:22,480
females flowering right and from that

881
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,079
point uh I track between 6 to8 weeks

882
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,440
after that point for seed maturity into

883
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,480
Harvest and I have observed consistently

884
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,039
that it seems to be around 6 to 8 weeks

885
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,800
it doesn't really change I mean it

886
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,119
changed within those 6 to8 weeks but um

887
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,599
that's around the time when you should

888
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,240
have for Dual

889
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,240
Purpose thank you

890
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:48,640
yep hi is there somebody hi Lou thank

891
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:51,920
you for your presentation I was

892
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:55,159
wondering about Ursa Al uh other than a

893
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,240
short critical dayline threshold what uh

894
00:40:55,159 --> 00:41:04,799
other uh characteristics special for New

895
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:07,759
York Farmers you mentioned um uh the uh

896
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,880
mean dry Reddit F Versa at different

897
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,280
latitudes and it actually did pretty

898
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,920
well in Kentucky too so I was wondering

899
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,400
if you could talk about more what are

900
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,880
the specific characteristics of UR ala

901
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,680
other than

902
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:24,280
critical that make it special for new

903
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:25,960
Farm yeah so let me just uh BR that

904
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,519
question a little bit the question about

905
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,599
is about what is so special about Ursa

906
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:35,559
Alta uh

907
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:38,880
so we have uh using marker assisted

908
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:43,119
selection uh from very late

909
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,960
flowering uh land races from China we

910
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:49,519
have selected these two cultivars we

911
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:52,480
trademarked the name Ursa which is the

912
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:55,480
Latin name for bear that's our our

913
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,480
mascot uh so all of the varieties that

914
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,559
we produce in our Cornell breing program

915
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,599
will be trademarked with that Versa name

916
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:06,440
uh and these two first two cultivars

917
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,000
were developed with funding from the

918
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,079
foundation for food and agriculture

919
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,719
research and matching funds from

920
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,920
International hemp and they have been

921
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:18,519
licensed uh exclusively in the US to

922
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,800
International hemp for

923
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:23,199
distribution uh and Seed production and

924
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,960
we call them Grande Grande has large

925
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:29,879
seeds uh Louis is very fond of large

926
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:32,400
seeds and and Ulta uh is an exclusively

927
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,800
fiber variety we cannot produce seed of

928
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,760
that Variety in New

929
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:43,519
York uh so Ruiz what is so special about

930
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:47,880
Ulta uh well uh I don't know who of you

931
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:51,079
you attended the USDA but uh my my lab

932
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:54,440
mate uh Lucia vial uh said that

933
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:58,079
apparently is resistant to both ferium

934
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:00,838
and sorry not ferum septoria and Par

935
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,880
uh from her uh screening so that's very

936
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:06,759
encouraging um and very exciting to be

937
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,838
honest uh so that makes it special I

938
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,920
would imagine um if you look at the

939
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:14,400
plant also uh to meet the leaf area

940
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,599
makes it very special because what I

941
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,280
believe is that you can decrease the

942
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:23,119
stand count uh or the plan in density

943
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:26,839
and you still have a good wi competition

944
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,358
and uh narrow stem so that Lea area

945
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:31,039
makes it competitive compared to other

946
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:35,119
uh commercially available cultiv such as

947
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:37,000
Futura 83 the LI is is um much larger

948
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,720
than for 83 so I would say that makes it

949
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:45,000
a special as well U likewise uh Ora

950
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:48,000
Grand is also large uh has a large T

951
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,480
leaves thank you yep yeah a couple of

952
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,358
other things so uh we have not had the

953
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,679
opportunity yet to determine

954
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:59,078
decortication efficiency and Bast yield

955
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:01,838
but we collaborate with David suchoff at

956
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:05,920
North Carolina State University and I

957
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:09,519
believe uh our our varieties are among

958
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,880
the highest and vast fiber yield among

959
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:14,559
the varieties that he tested in similar

960
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:17,160
small small plop trials

961
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,119
so uh we we highly value that

962
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:21,078
collaboration with North Carolina State

963
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,920
and they have an excellent College of

964
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:28,280
textiles there where we will be able to

965
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:31,720
assess fiber quality of of these new eer

966
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:35,880
varieties other questions

967
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:39,318
yes um you mentioned that you want very

968
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:42,640
thin is it because the vast fiber ratio

969
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:47,679
is it because the equipment is not there

970
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:49,679
for thicker or or is it both why uh well

971
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:51,679
I would say both one is because of the

972
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:55,519
ratio the thicker the stem they lower

973
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:57,118
the bass to her uh ratio uh but also if

974
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,480
you have a stem that is a whole trunk

975
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,240
you will not be able to decorate uh from

976
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,719
what I heard from some I think one

977
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:06,558
processor was that if the stem is wider

978
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:09,279
than an inch it will not thecate so you

979
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,920
cannot process a high can avoid stem for

980
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,319
example but it's because the equipment

981
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,079
is not there I think it's because of the

982
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:18,759
I believe is because of the bast to her

983
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:22,519
ratio you will get more H HT than vast

984
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,520
and ultimately also the

985
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,960
equipment Ty Ty how are you

986
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:35,039
yeah tyer is asking how I'm harvesting

987
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:36,720
these plots so what I do is I harvest

988
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:39,119
one square meter that should be

989
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,959
representative of the entire pass so if

990
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,559
you walk around you will see some holes

991
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,400
in the middle that's where I place my

992
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:45,960
quadrant and harvest everything in it so

993
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,639
that allows me to determine a yield

994
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,639
based on that specific uh one square

995
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:58,920
meter yep question over there what Trace

996
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,920
did you use markers for when you

997
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,920
can you repeat the question the question

998
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:15,760
is um so for marazine selection we did

999
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:18,599
uh chemotype for chemotype 3 solely uh

1000
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:22,119
so we'll have the this only these two

1001
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:24,640
alos that we produce uh mostly

1002
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:27,640
CBD uh and then the other selection

1003
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:30,279
criteria that we use was flower in time

1004
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:34,159
to make sure that uh is within one

1005
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:36,480
window of uh it hasn't flower like for

1006
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,480
several weeks but also like uniformly

1007
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,119
like I don't know like let's say like in

1008
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,760
in two three weeks you have everything

1009
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:44,559
flowering or something like that as

1010
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:48,880
opposed to flowering over several weeks

1011
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:50,880
uh and uh a specific flowering time when

1012
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,119
we want those to flower so for example

1013
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,960
Sala will be harvested I believe at um

1014
00:46:54,119 --> 00:47:00,800
early and between early and mid October

1015
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:04,039
that's the the window that we chose for

1016
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,880
it yeah so just another point about

1017
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:08,719
flowering time and what we've been

1018
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,400
harvesting here so as you drive around

1019
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:13,000
you're going to see some fields that

1020
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,400
have already been harvested red red

1021
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,199
we're going to demonstrate bailing

1022
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,599
raking and bailing some of

1023
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:19,679
those uh we're going to walk down and

1024
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:22,240
look at

1025
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:23,919
carmena uh where the Harvester is that

1026
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,879
we're going to run the fiber cut through

1027
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,240
that

1028
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:31,119
carmena and for fiber that field is

1029
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:33,639
already gone past the males have already

1030
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,760
sessed uh and if you were harvesting for

1031
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:38,358
fiber you're too late it's just about

1032
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,280
perfect right now if you were going to

1033
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:44,440
do a dual purpose Harvest uh because the

1034
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:48,040
grain is mature in that variety uh so

1035
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:51,800
the French varieties uh such as uh

1036
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:54,759
future 83 and FIB were ready to harvest

1037
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:58,880
what about three weeks ago yep for

1038
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:01,800
fiber uh and as Louise said Ur Alta

1039
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:05,400
won't be ready for another uh 3 weeks

1040
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:07,280
yep which is ideal so it continues to

1041
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,200
accumulate biomass over that time

1042
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:13,680
because of its late flowering

1043
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:16,919
nature uh yeah so the the last point I

1044
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:20,239
want to make uh is that these small plot

1045
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:22,800
trials are have been organized by my

1046
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:26,118
colleague Bob Pierce at University of

1047
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,400
Kentucky uh and we all work together

1048
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:31,800
under

1049
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:34,480
uh the organization of a USDA program uh

1050
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,839
which is called a multi-state program

1051
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,800
and that particular hemp research

1052
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:43,039
project is called

1053
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:46,839
s184 and you can Google that s184 hemp

1054
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:48,960
research and uh our our project

1055
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:51,558
objectives and some of our initial

1056
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:55,440
results will come up when you Google

1057
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:59,160
that uh but these types of plots are

1058
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,159
replicated I think this year at about 15

1059
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:02,000
different

1060
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,440
institutions if you went to the

1061
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,519
Lancaster hemp circuit you saw another

1062
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,838
replicate uh that Alyssa Collins planted

1063
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:12,079
at Penn

1064
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:14,920
State uh but we have Ursa Alta and Ursa

1065
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,318
Grande in all of those small plot trials

1066
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,358
around the country so we will get very

1067
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:20,798
good data from our academic colleagues

1068
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:24,279
on the performance of those two

1069
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:26,440
varieties anecdotally and Shelby Ellison

1070
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,960
is here from Wisconsin David Gang is

1071
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,920
here from Washington State uh they can

1072
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,798
tell you how uh Ursa alt and urser

1073
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:38,760
Grande are doing compared with other

1074
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:41,000
lines uh that uh are in this trial uh

1075
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,559
just one final note about because Sarah

1076
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,838
is Raising her hand one final note about

1077
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:49,040
obtaining seed uh you want to order your

1078
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:52,239
seed as soon as possible if you could

1079
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:55,239
order it now you should do it and you

1080
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:57,279
should go talk to Robin dtit from canopi

1081
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:59,719
us if you want

1082
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,440
some of their outstanding varieties you

1083
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:04,358
should talk to Sarah Mitchell of Kings

1084
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:08,079
Agra seed who distributes International

1085
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:10,519
hemp and Verve seed varieties and any

1086
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,160
others and New West genetics oh yeah I

1087
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:13,159
forgot about

1088
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:23,720
them yep just one more Point here uh and

1089
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:27,000
I don't want to forget my colleagues

1090
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:30,239
from indd hemp uh they have an excellent

1091
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,838
variety here which we've labeled SS beta

1092
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:36,879
but uh commercially is known as IH

1093
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:38,759
Williams uh named after our our deceased

1094
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,000
colleague David Williams from University

1095
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:45,760
of Kentucky so here you have uh three

1096
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,318
excellent uh seed Brokers to talk to uh

1097
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,079
if you want to order seed Valerie you

1098
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:52,880
were asking about

1099
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:57,440
cross-pollination so

1100
00:50:52,880 --> 00:51:00,519
uh yeah certainly in a breeding program

1101
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,838
we would not grow anything any breeding

1102
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:08,239
lines in the presence of these varieties

1103
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:10,440
we want isolation preferably of uh 3

1104
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,318
miles uh to make sure that there's no

1105
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,358
cross-pollination and to maintain the

1106
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:16,759
purity of our varieties that's also

1107
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,679
critical during the production of

1108
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,680
certified seed and the rule state if

1109
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,318
you're going to produce seed for

1110
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:27,159
planting you cannot have any other hemp

1111
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:28,920
within 3 miles to make sure that uh we

1112
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:31,920
maintain that

1113
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,519
Purity uh in a monious variety it's most

1114
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,119
likely

1115
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:38,798
self-pollinated uh because the male and

1116
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:41,240
female flowers are within the same

1117
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:43,798
infloresence and obviously in the dous

1118
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:46,558
varieties you have male individuals and

1119
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:47,880
female individuals I I'll just say one

1120
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,119
thing we note about those male

1121
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,400
individuals they're very attractive to

1122
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:57,200
bees uh both honeybees and

1123
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:59,639
bumblebees uh so it is a good food

1124
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:02,798
Source uh male pollen is a good food

1125
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:05,719
source for bees but hemp is entirely

1126
00:52:02,798 --> 00:52:08,199
wind pollinated those bees do not go to

1127
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:11,399
the female flowers

1128
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:13,679
so yeah Sarah what are the growing

1129
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,519
conditions is the crap shorter to me

1130
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:18,199
than in previous years what happened

1131
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:20,318
this season to keep thisp

1132
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:21,159
short yeah uh you're not the only one I

1133
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:23,838
noticed

1134
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:26,838
that uh yeah I also want to the same

1135
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:29,279
thing uh and what I've noticed and this

1136
00:52:26,838 --> 00:52:32,480
is one idea I have no idea sorry

1137
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,599
hypothesis I have is that this field uh

1138
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,400
after s rain fall rful events it gets

1139
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:40,318
really water logged so I believe that it

1140
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,960
may have suffered some it have suffered

1141
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:48,639
from uh water logging stress and that's

1142
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,639
why it has not uh riches you know

1143
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:56,920
one um I believe so I cannot tell you

1144
00:52:55,159 --> 00:53:00,118
but there is another plan thing I at

1145
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:02,119
this 3 weeks after uh you can see in the

1146
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:05,039
back over there and those look way

1147
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:07,160
taller um so they that field does not

1148
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:09,440
suffer for that water logging so I would

1149
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:11,679
imagine that water logging would be the

1150
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,039
the main factor why they are shorter

1151
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:17,078
what is the plan date uh this one was

1152
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:20,480
May 20th that was June

1153
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:23,400
13th yeah so hemp does not like to be

1154
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:26,159
wet and it will stop growing when it

1155
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,760
rains and when it's uh you know water

1156
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,879
lost

1157
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,240
uh the remnants of what was it hurricane

1158
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:36,039
Debbie came through and gave us about 4

1159
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:38,199
in of rain that day and uh this is

1160
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:40,838
another uh sort of feature of our

1161
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:43,679
research Fields here you see that we

1162
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:45,960
maintain these 2 acre blocks and these

1163
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:48,838
two acre blocks have been here for

1164
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,798
decades and as we plow these blocks and

1165
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:54,000
then maintain driveways in

1166
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:56,838
between the soil subsides and they

1167
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,838
become swimming pools so when when it

1168
00:53:56,838 --> 00:54:01,920
rains uh our Fields get flooded and and

1169
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:04,798
you'll notice we have a 2 acre field of

1170
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,318
Ursa Alta up on the hill there on the

1171
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:09,599
other side of the

1172
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:12,440
apples and when you look at that it is

1173
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:15,000
tallest in the middle and the plants

1174
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:17,559
have even DED around the edges of the

1175
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,719
swimming pool uh because that's where

1176
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:22,440
the water

1177
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:25,159
pools uh so I'm actually uh trying to

1178
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,559
get the folks here to knock down our

1179
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:29,838
driveways and and to just plow

1180
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:31,839
everything again and get rid of these

1181
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:36,639
driveways and level out the swimming

1182
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:39,719
pools that we have here okay uh there

1183
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:42,318
are lots more questions you could ask uh

1184
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:45,078
so definitely catch up to Louise or

1185
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:48,279
other folks in my group wearing aggrock

1186
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:52,359
shirts but I do want to give you uh a

1187
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:55,240
little about 20 minutes to talk to walk

1188
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:56,759
through the plots and uh see any

1189
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:59,118
features

1190
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:03,640
uh that you're curious about and then we

1191
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:06,400
will meet at that speaker over there at

1192
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:09,639
950

1193
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,639
okay thanks

1194
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:22,159
Lise so one thing we've learned and uh

1195
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,160
you can talk to any of the researchers

1196
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:26,679
here who have been trying to establish

1197
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:29,318
hemp in Trials over the last six or

1198
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:31,318
seven years that it could be very

1199
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:34,440
challenging to get good stand

1200
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:35,480
establishment of hemp uh it does not

1201
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,480
like to be

1202
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:40,039
wet uh so what I always tell my folks

1203
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,400
when they're very anxious to get their

1204
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:46,839
research trials going is to plant after

1205
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:49,519
the storm all right I think a lot of

1206
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:50,920
crops you would think oh I want to get

1207
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:53,079
that seed in the ground and then it's

1208
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:57,318
going to rain and my seat is going to

1209
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:59,680
pop right up after that rain uh I do not

1210
00:55:57,318 --> 00:56:02,838
recommend that for him you want to let

1211
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:06,239
that rain saturate the soil and then

1212
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:10,119
watch the soil moisture and then

1213
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:11,639
plant uh because when it's flooded it

1214
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:14,200
will not come

1215
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:17,519
up uh so that's one little

1216
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:20,639
thing uh to think about is proper soil

1217
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:22,960
moisture and depth and plant deep plant

1218
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:23,960
down to your where your moisture is in

1219
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,798
the

1220
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:29,358
soil uh but the other critical

1221
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:33,599
aspect is weed management and we are

1222
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:35,679
very fortunate to have Dr ly soski here

1223
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:38,039
who is our weed scientist at Cornell

1224
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:41,679
agratech and has been doing a lot of

1225
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:44,839
work on herbicide control and non

1226
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:48,038
herbicide methods for weed management

1227
00:56:44,838 --> 00:56:50,480
and uh is also our state representative

1228
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:53,000
to the ir4 program so I'm going to turn

1229
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,119
it over to her and she's going to talk

1230
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,039
about a little bit about herbicides and

1231
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:01,519
sonin I think

1232
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:02,880
hi yeah thanks for for for coming out

1233
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,960
and thanks for having me and I'm going

1234
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,440
to talk a little bit about some of the

1235
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,639
work that we've been doing through a

1236
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:12,960
USDA CPM project looking at hemp

1237
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:17,679
competition hemp we control as well as

1238
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:21,079
some of our ir4 projects so um hemp in

1239
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:23,318
some Outlets has been reported as being

1240
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:25,920
fairly competitive with weeds but I

1241
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:28,639
think uh the work that we've done here

1242
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,798
is that if you don't get a good stand

1243
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:32,960
establishment if the weeds get a jump on

1244
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:35,759
you hemp is not necessarily going to

1245
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,440
catch up and frankly our work that we've

1246
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:41,599
been doing across five states in both

1247
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:44,200
transplanted hemp and seated hemp really

1248
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:48,280
suggests that we're going to need about

1249
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:52,279
four to six Weed Free weeks after

1250
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:56,720
emergence uh to really maximize hemp

1251
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:58,920
growth and yield so I do want to point

1252
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:00,879
out that this is going to require

1253
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:04,280
integrated weed management I think

1254
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:06,760
everybody knows that pesticide uh

1255
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:09,400
options are limited in hemp and and that

1256
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,559
includes herbicides we have one single

1257
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:14,519
herbicide and frankly we are lucky to

1258
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:16,920
have that one herbicide for use in hemp

1259
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:19,920
so I am going to point out if you do

1260
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:23,079
have the handout here I do have a link

1261
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,760
in it to a free book that you can

1262
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:26,760
download from the Northeast s website

1263
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,280
called

1264
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,599
um integrated or uh sustainable uh weed

1265
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:36,160
Management on your farm ecological weed

1266
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:38,960
Management on your farm it is great book

1267
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:41,318
talking about integrated weed management

1268
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,280
practices and since we only have one

1269
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:45,679
herbicide I do want to start off with

1270
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,760
the integrated weed management practices

1271
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:50,199
that we should be engaged in we should

1272
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:54,720
be thinking about when we're going to

1273
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:58,038
plant hemp the first is going to be site

1274
00:58:54,719 --> 00:59:01,639
selection than about the fields that you

1275
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:04,799
have available to plant into if you have

1276
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:08,798
Fields with really competitive weed

1277
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:12,318
species really high densities of weeds

1278
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:15,159
or perennial weeds like bind weed Canada

1279
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:18,960
thistle uh that would be a field to

1280
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:21,399
avoid so uh being very mindful about

1281
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,199
scouting your Fields understanding what

1282
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:26,400
the weed communities look like we have a

1283
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:29,118
couple of pig weed species here we have

1284
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:32,318
our usual pow amaran redroot smooth

1285
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:35,798
pigweed but we also have Palmer amaran

1286
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:38,159
and water hemp creeping into the state

1287
00:59:35,798 --> 00:59:41,480
and those weeds can grow up to 10 feet

1288
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:44,118
tall okay so you need if if you're going

1289
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,920
to be rotating into an agricultural

1290
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:47,960
production field and there could be

1291
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,079
Palmer amarand and water hemp that is

1292
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,199
not a field we want to be in with hemp

1293
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,200
we don't have the options for

1294
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:57,038
controlling these species they grow tall

1295
00:59:54,199 --> 01:00:00,000
they grow fast and the the seed

1296
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:03,119
production is enormous and so those seed

1297
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,920
banks build very quickly another

1298
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,039
technique that we can use as a stale

1299
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:09,039
seedbed technique and this is going to

1300
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:11,559
depend on your planting date and the

1301
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:14,240
species that you have there is you can

1302
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:17,798
allow species to germinate and then go

1303
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:19,558
in and kill them either with a like a a

1304
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:22,559
when they're at the white thread stage a

1305
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:24,559
shallow discing uh you can go in with a

1306
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,079
non-selective herbicide that you can

1307
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,839
burn them down you can go in with a

1308
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,240
flame weader this is something we're

1309
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:32,400
doing with crays right now in their

1310
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:34,399
organic beet production is letting the

1311
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,920
weeds get up going in with a flame

1312
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,599
weeder burning them off maybe doing that

1313
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,680
two or three times before planting so

1314
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:44,559
that seed bank that's already present

1315
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:46,358
allowing some of those weeds to get up

1316
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,920
and then get them killed so maybe when

1317
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:51,798
it comes time for planting you are

1318
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:54,318
dealing with fewer options uh fewer

1319
01:00:51,798 --> 01:00:57,358
weeds that are going to need to be

1320
01:00:54,318 --> 01:01:00,519
controlled seed bed preparation this is

1321
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:04,078
for you know General crop management

1322
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:07,599
having a smooth even bed if you can plan

1323
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:11,039
into a smooth even bed you're going to

1324
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:14,240
facilitate good seed soil contact you're

1325
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:16,359
going to have better stand establishment

1326
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:19,318
hopefully you're going to have more even

1327
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:21,679
germination more even emergence and

1328
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:25,000
growth and that is going to help you

1329
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:27,480
have a strong crop stand because you're

1330
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,358
going to want a Max maximiz crop Vigor

1331
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:33,519
and stand development obviously choosing

1332
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:36,279
varieties with high Vigor rapid growth

1333
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:38,559
as is appropriate for what other uh

1334
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,960
parameters you're interested in

1335
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,599
basically you want to make sure that

1336
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,679
You' get a good even stand you want to

1337
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:47,680
minimize the space that's available for

1338
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:50,598
the weeds to colonize and then when it

1339
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:53,838
comes to harvest time making sure that

1340
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:56,359
you're harvesting clean Fields first do

1341
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:58,078
not go to your weediest field Harvest

1342
01:01:56,358 --> 01:02:00,519
that and then go to a field that's

1343
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:03,680
relatively clean all you are doing is

1344
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:07,239
moving weed seed from your weedy field

1345
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:09,598
now to your clean field um Mike Hunter

1346
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:11,318
I'm from New York State IPM we have a

1347
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,798
separate handout and this is just

1348
01:02:11,318 --> 01:02:17,318
general for all your Harvest equipment

1349
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:20,199
it is talking about weed seed movement

1350
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:22,480
and Equipment cleanout please check this

1351
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:24,879
out if if you are doing you know kind of

1352
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,199
your grain your fiber harvesting whether

1353
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,079
you're talking hemp whether you're

1354
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:31,558
talking other crops we are moving a lot

1355
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:34,079
of weed seed around we are moving a lot

1356
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:36,400
of problematic weeds like the water hemp

1357
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:39,599
like the Palmer hamr is coming in on our

1358
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:43,639
equipment and this is a this is an an

1359
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:45,278
easy strategy we can use uh to minimize

1360
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:48,759
the spread of some of these super

1361
01:02:45,278 --> 01:02:50,920
invasive super problematic species now

1362
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,920
the last thing I want to uh talk about

1363
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:55,519
is is going to be

1364
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:58,480
herbicides herbicides can be both in the

1365
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:01,440
season seon with uh that of hemp we're

1366
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:05,639
going to be talking about sonol land now

1367
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:08,559
we do talk about if we can put hemp into

1368
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:12,000
an effective crop rotation so if we can

1369
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:15,200
get very good weed control in preceding

1370
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:19,159
crops that can help us in our hem crop

1371
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:22,879
but understand labels have rotation

1372
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:25,278
restrictions on them okay there are

1373
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,519
rotation restrictions on the labels and

1374
01:03:25,278 --> 01:03:30,358
you must pay attention to them those

1375
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:33,960
rotation restrictions are there from the

1376
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:37,119
EPA because of residue potential but I'm

1377
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:42,318
going to tell you hemp is very sensitive

1378
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:44,960
to a lot of herbicides so we got to be

1379
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:47,759
very mindful we have to be thinking also

1380
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,199
of what the carryover injury could

1381
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:54,200
potentially be I have looked at about a

1382
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:56,960
dozen plus soil applied herbicides and

1383
01:03:54,199 --> 01:04:00,399
I'm going to tell you what

1384
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:03,240
about 11 of them have have killed him

1385
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,278
outright so we've got to be very mindful

1386
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:07,919
so it's it's kind of a double-edged

1387
01:04:05,278 --> 01:04:10,318
sword we might get good weed control in

1388
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,639
one crop but the uh rotation

1389
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:15,639
restrictions those potential residue

1390
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:18,920
concerns that potential injury could be

1391
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:21,199
an issue of rotating into the hemp year

1392
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:24,240
so please be mindful and hemp is not

1393
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:26,759
going to fall into a lot of those uh

1394
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:28,759
crop rotation restrictions so it falls

1395
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,640
under the other crop category which

1396
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:33,000
tends to be much more

1397
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:35,558
restrictive all right so on to sauna

1398
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:39,358
land sauna Land is Our Only registered

1399
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:42,160
herbicide it is a supplemental label uh

1400
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:44,759
in New York state it expires on the 1st

1401
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:47,278
of May in 2026 you're going to have to

1402
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:49,760
go to the nice pad website and download

1403
01:04:47,278 --> 01:04:53,318
that supplemental label and have it on

1404
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:55,319
hand this herbicide uh e the Florin it

1405
01:04:53,318 --> 01:04:57,920
is a yellow herbicide anyone who is

1406
01:04:55,318 --> 01:05:01,519
familiar with the wssa groups this is a

1407
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:04,680
group three it's a dinitro analine this

1408
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:07,719
herbicide is primarily effective at

1409
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:11,199
suppressing annual grasses such as crab

1410
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:14,679
grasses foxtails barnyard grass it may

1411
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:16,838
have activity against some small seeded

1412
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:19,798
annual broad leaves like Pig weeds N

1413
01:05:16,838 --> 01:05:22,199
Shades but it is not a strong broadleaf

1414
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:24,519
herbicide I do not think about this as a

1415
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:26,399
broadleaf herbicide think about this as

1416
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:29,119
a grass herbicide

1417
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:32,240
primarily uh it can be applied at rates

1418
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:34,559
ranging from 1 and2 to 3 pins per acre I

1419
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:36,759
believe we've used 2.5 in our trials

1420
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:39,079
here these rates are going to be

1421
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,680
dependent on your soil type if you have

1422
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:43,079
a coarse soil and your sandier you're

1423
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:45,759
going to go

1424
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:47,318
lower now this can be incorporated two

1425
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,799
ways it can be applied as a

1426
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:52,358
pre-emergence so after the crop has been

1427
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:54,440
planted applied to the surface and then

1428
01:05:52,358 --> 01:05:55,880
it's going to have to be irrigated in or

1429
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,000
it's going to have to have rainfall fall

1430
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:00,760
to move it into the soil solution where

1431
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,798
it's active or it can be mechanically

1432
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:06,160
Incorporated pre-plant Incorporated so

1433
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:10,480
sonol land is applied it's Incorporated

1434
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:12,879
you plant into it now if we have done a

1435
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,358
study here on the campus and basically

1436
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:18,519
we found pre pre-plan Incorporated

1437
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:21,920
versus pre-emergence we had hemp uh

1438
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:25,679
emerge and establish equally well with

1439
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:28,680
respect to the weed control this year

1440
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:31,558
the pre-plant Incorporated gave us much

1441
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:35,440
better control than our pre-emergence we

1442
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:37,760
had a very dry year we had a very dry

1443
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:40,838
year so we felt that we got that uh

1444
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:43,319
sauna land incorporated into the soil

1445
01:06:40,838 --> 01:06:45,480
solution uh physically better than we

1446
01:06:43,318 --> 01:06:47,480
would have done with the pre-emergence

1447
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,278
the other issue we had is when that soil

1448
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,199
started to dry down we started to have

1449
01:06:49,278 --> 01:06:54,079
cracks in the soil and our weeds started

1450
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:56,038
to come up through the cracks completely

1451
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,599
avoiding the herbicide

1452
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:00,760
this has been shown in other crops is

1453
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:03,278
that where we have dry conditions

1454
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:06,920
pre-plan Incorporated may be more

1455
01:07:03,278 --> 01:07:08,760
effective than a pre-emergence

1456
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:11,159
application understand if you're going

1457
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:13,039
to be doing a pre-planned Incorporated

1458
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:16,598
this is going to be a single pass

1459
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:18,799
mechanical incorporation Tran similar

1460
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:21,960
herbicide to e florland we like to do

1461
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:25,759
two passes eth flurin is recommended as

1462
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:28,519
a single pass if you have clumps and

1463
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,520
clots if that soil is too wet you are

1464
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:33,038
not going to incorporate that herbicide

1465
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:35,239
well you are going to have patchy weed

1466
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:37,559
control and you have the potential for

1467
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:39,558
increased herbicide injury because

1468
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:41,960
you'll have it concentrated in certain

1469
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:44,200
areas as opposed to others I'm also

1470
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:47,318
going to tell you if we get heavy

1471
01:07:44,199 --> 01:07:49,598
rainfall and we have flooded conditions

1472
01:07:47,318 --> 01:07:53,798
you will get injury from

1473
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:56,278
sonan um it can do it that is uh um

1474
01:07:53,798 --> 01:07:58,559
mentioned on the label what you'll see

1475
01:07:56,278 --> 01:08:00,639
is stubby Roots you'll see swollen

1476
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,920
brittle stems and you can just have

1477
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,838
breakage right there and that'll be a

1478
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:07,599
problem particularly if we get strong

1479
01:08:04,838 --> 01:08:09,838
winds coming through so just because

1480
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:12,960
this is registered does not mean it is

1481
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:16,960
100% safe you can get injury

1482
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:18,719
particularly under wet conditions um

1483
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,000
also the injury potential is going to be

1484
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,600
increased if you don't have your sprayer

1485
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,640
calibrated properly you're not putting

1486
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,359
it out at the proper rate or you don't

1487
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:30,000
line up and you have overlapping and

1488
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:34,400
you're uh increasing the concentration

1489
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,679
of that herbicide in certain areas um

1490
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:40,559
the last thing I'd like to mention uh is

1491
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:43,158
I am the the state liaison for the ir4 I

1492
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:46,159
do the ir4 research for herbicides here

1493
01:08:43,158 --> 01:08:49,079
in New York and uh I do want to just

1494
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:51,358
point out is that we do put hemp

1495
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:54,439
recommendations hemp requests into the

1496
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:57,359
ir4 program right now we are setting our

1497
01:08:54,439 --> 01:09:00,798
final our final uh priorities for the

1498
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:02,480
2025 season there were hundreds of

1499
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:05,079
recommend of requests that went in

1500
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:08,759
across weed science Plant Pathology

1501
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:12,158
entomology and all crops uh we have to

1502
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:14,798
narrow it down to 40 so it's hard and

1503
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:16,798
hemp gets too and but I'm going to tell

1504
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:19,759
you I don't think herbicides are going

1505
01:09:16,798 --> 01:09:23,079
to be in the program for next year for

1506
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:24,880
hemp um just looking at the ir4 food

1507
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:28,238
requests in previous years we've

1508
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,759
recommended did uh uh dual Magnum we've

1509
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,158
recommended berox andil we've

1510
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,560
recommended Stinger all all herbicides

1511
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:36,278
that we've seen a measure of safety and

1512
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,319
basically the manufacturers have said

1513
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:40,759
they are not going to support this year

1514
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,239
we recommended codm it is a grass

1515
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:45,279
herbicide a postemergence grass

1516
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:48,358
herbicide we heard back at this Workshop

1517
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:50,679
the manufacturer will not support so

1518
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:53,359
right now there are two other residual

1519
01:09:50,679 --> 01:09:55,880
herbicides that are kind of in the mix

1520
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:57,800
and uh frankly just based on discussions

1521
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,119
with the weed science team it's not

1522
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:03,640
looking good from there's just too much

1523
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:06,479
variable injury across the United States

1524
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:09,360
so I want to just swing it back to what

1525
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:12,119
I started off with I am not very

1526
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:14,559
confident about the herbicide outlook

1527
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:17,719
for the future just from an injury

1528
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,440
standpoint and from a a company

1529
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:23,640
standpoint with respect to regulations

1530
01:10:20,439 --> 01:10:26,000
legality and just their twitchiness of

1531
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:29,719
being involved with hemp and it's its

1532
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,439
current regulation environment um which

1533
01:10:29,719 --> 01:10:33,719
means that we're going to have to be

1534
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:37,039
very very very mindful about the

1535
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:39,880
integrated weed management again weed

1536
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:42,640
Management in preceding crops again

1537
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:46,079
thinking about herbicide residue and

1538
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:48,360
injury Potential from those products

1539
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:51,158
then using those alternate strategies

1540
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:54,719
and I'm really very very very interested

1541
01:10:51,158 --> 01:10:57,679
in uh doing some more tests with uh the

1542
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:01,079
stale seeded uh techniques going forward

1543
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,079
next year I think that's going to be

1544
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:08,999
[Applause]

1545
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:14,600
critical L Len is trying to run away

1546
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:16,399
before you ask any

1547
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,199
questions questions for

1548
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:21,319
[Music]

1549
01:11:18,198 --> 01:11:24,359
Lynn I I will say we are doing priority

1550
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:26,079
setting right now and I I left so I

1551
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:28,319
could come out here

1552
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:33,479
Yeah question how many varieties uh was

1553
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:36,238
the IDE trial on uh so that I cannot

1554
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:37,959
tell you right now here is the other

1555
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:41,079
problem and thank you for bringing that

1556
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:44,840
up hemp varieties the the pre-plant

1557
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:48,479
incorporation versus pre we just

1558
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:50,880
the we we have just done Bea breski here

1559
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:53,479
I have done other pre-emergence trials

1560
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:56,000
with Ana and I'm going to tell you seed

1561
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:58,039
Viger is really going to change that too

1562
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,079
cuz we had some UNCA that did not have a

1563
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:04,439
good seed Viger and boy herbicide injury

1564
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:06,319
is magnified if you don't have good seed

1565
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:10,039
Viger and that crop is going to struggle

1566
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:12,399
to get out of the ground um it it trust

1567
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:14,319
me we've seen it across crops the other

1568
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:16,319
thing that I want to bring up about hemp

1569
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:18,960
even with the sauna land the label says

1570
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:21,238
it is not tested on all hemp varieties

1571
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:25,158
and you have a lot of genetic diversity

1572
01:12:21,238 --> 01:12:26,879
in this crop now the USDA actually just

1573
01:12:25,158 --> 01:12:29,479
published a paper on field corn and

1574
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,480
sweet corn on a a herbicide that we have

1575
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:34,678
labeled and that we use regularly an

1576
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:36,919
hppd herbicide and they found that there

1577
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:39,000
was a whole genetic background across

1578
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,639
all of our corn that's in some of the

1579
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,679
sweet corn and in some of the field corn

1580
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:46,920
and it makes that the varieties that

1581
01:12:44,679 --> 01:12:50,239
that uh were evolved from that more

1582
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:54,440
sensitive to this one herbicide so that

1583
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:57,279
is the other issue we can't test every

1584
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:59,759
every variet out there we can't test all

1585
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:01,238
the genetic background so you have to

1586
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,719
understand there's always going to be

1587
01:13:01,238 --> 01:13:06,000
that potential for injury we think we

1588
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:09,198
know everything about corn come on we've

1589
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,520
been working on corn forever and we just

1590
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:14,559
this year discovered you know uh a

1591
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:17,199
genetic element that makes certain

1592
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:20,840
varieties more sensitive to a herbicide

1593
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:22,599
that we've had registered so just

1594
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,119
understand there's a lot in that genetic

1595
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:28,039
background that is going to potentially

1596
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:30,519
influence the safety and so the you know

1597
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:34,479
the sonol land label does recommend

1598
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:37,239
testing on you know a small amounts of

1599
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:41,079
of you know a a a planted crop at first

1600
01:13:37,238 --> 01:13:43,959
or become familiar with this uh in a

1601
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:46,679
variety that you are going to use

1602
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:49,198
because there is just that potential

1603
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:51,279
okay last question DAV quick you

1604
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:54,158
mentioned uh mechanical incorporation

1605
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:57,119
pre-planting how deep uh I believe we

1606
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:59,559
went 2 in oh just just shallow this is

1607
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:02,079
going to be a shallow incorporation but

1608
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:05,360
again I think it probably your soil

1609
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:07,039
quality is going to be critical again

1610
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:10,238
making sure that it's evenly

1611
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,238
Incorporated in that 2

1612
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:16,840
in yeah so that thank you very much Lynn

1613
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:18,839
uh she is a wealth of knowledge so if

1614
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:21,480
you have questions about uh weed

1615
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:22,520
management uh please don't hesitate to

1616
01:14:21,479 --> 01:14:25,279
contact

1617
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:28,120
Lynn and and she always gets back you

1618
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:28,119
very quickly

1619
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:37,079
so so uh that is a good segue David uh

1620
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,198
for my little three minute uh discussion

1621
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:41,800
about site

1622
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:45,000
preparation uh so we use conventional

1623
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:48,199
tillage on this Farm uh we use

1624
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:51,399
relatively little no no till practices

1625
01:14:48,198 --> 01:14:56,599
here uh so all of our trials that you

1626
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:58,879
see here were uh mold board plowed

1627
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:03,560
dis and

1628
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:06,520
then uh cam mulched I believe until we

1629
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:09,360
got a a fairly well fitted field then we

1630
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:12,120
applied the sonlin culto mulch to

1631
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:16,279
incorporate it and the latest thing that

1632
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:17,599
we've been doing is uh incorporating a

1633
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:21,279
rolling

1634
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:24,159
step and so I learned that from uh my

1635
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:25,759
friend Corby midth of Kopi us that he

1636
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:29,238
said in France

1637
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:31,400
they roll all of their fields and so we

1638
01:15:29,238 --> 01:15:34,799
most of these fields out here have been

1639
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:38,198
rolled after planting so the small plot

1640
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:40,159
trial we seated it with our cone seeder

1641
01:15:38,198 --> 01:15:45,238
and then we rolled the

1642
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:47,319
field and by doing that we ensure good

1643
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:51,678
seed to soil

1644
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:55,000
contact we get an A nice uh level field

1645
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:57,520
uh if we were going to do the pre

1646
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,560
emergent application of Salin we as Lynn

1647
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,920
said we would have a nice level the uh

1648
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,600
surface for

1649
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:08,480
that

1650
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:10,320
uh we ensure that the seed is buried uh

1651
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:12,238
because bird predation right after

1652
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:14,960
planting is a huge

1653
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:16,439
problem and actually I think at the high

1654
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,439
especially at the higher seating rate

1655
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:22,000
for the fiber varieties those birds the

1656
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:23,719
doves can pick out the rows that you've

1657
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,520
seated at a higher seating rate and they

1658
01:16:23,719 --> 01:16:26,960
will just sit there and

1659
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,440
and eat all your

1660
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:32,760
seed uh it's not a minor thing don't

1661
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:35,399
dismiss it uh and then the final benefit

1662
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:38,280
that we see of rolling is that it pushes

1663
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:39,238
the Rocks down and the first year we

1664
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:41,759
started

1665
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:42,839
bailing uh and then running Bales

1666
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,800
through our

1667
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,880
decorticator uh we learned that they

1668
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,880
were full of

1669
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:51,679
rocks so you need to be when we get to

1670
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:54,199
the raking demonstration you need to you

1671
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:57,520
cannot be too aggressive with the rake

1672
01:16:54,198 --> 01:16:59,519
uh and flip rocks up into your uh wind

1673
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:02,120
rows because they will end up in your

1674
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,760
Bales and you really don't want rocks

1675
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:06,399
going through your

1676
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:08,840
decorticator so by Rolling uh one

1677
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:11,519
benefit that we see is uh that you push

1678
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:14,840
the Rocks down at least to the soil

1679
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:17,080
surface uh so we did a little study uh

1680
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,520
this field that uh Jacob just started

1681
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:22,880
cutting that's field

1682
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:27,239
20 uh was rolled just make sure I get my

1683
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:29,239
notes right uh was r before planting and

1684
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:30,799
then we seated it with a John Deere no

1685
01:17:29,238 --> 01:17:34,638
till

1686
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:36,719
drill the farther field uh the next two

1687
01:17:34,639 --> 01:17:41,079
acres down which is field

1688
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:44,760
25 we rolled after seating because I was

1689
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:46,439
talking with Sarah Mitchell and she said

1690
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:49,039
oh you can't roll after

1691
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:51,359
seating uh you won't get emergence

1692
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:53,880
tractor the tractor wheels the tract

1693
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:58,839
you've seen it with the tractor wheels

1694
01:17:53,880 --> 01:18:00,840
uh so what actually what I saw was uh

1695
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:03,840
there was no difference in the stand

1696
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:06,279
count at 3 weeks whether you roll before

1697
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:09,279
planting or roll after

1698
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:12,519
seeding and in fact you know this is our

1699
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:14,960
roller uh we just parked it out there uh

1700
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:16,760
so you can take a look at it you know it

1701
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,079
it's not going to compress it's not

1702
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:20,800
super heavy so it's not going to

1703
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:22,960
compress evenly across the field but

1704
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,119
what I saw is the areas where it did

1705
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,719
compress and we had a nice smooth flat

1706
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:30,559
surface that's where the seeds came up

1707
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:34,279
first because of that seed to soil

1708
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:35,719
contact so uh I I would all of our

1709
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:37,800
fields around here we grow a lot of

1710
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:41,079
alfalfa around our dairy farms those

1711
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:42,960
fields are rolled uh before planting I

1712
01:18:41,079 --> 01:18:45,639
just think it's probably a practice you

1713
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:49,600
want to think about uh for your grain

1714
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:49,600
and fiber hem the

1715
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:57,439
next the next thing we're going to hear

1716
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:59,440
about is uh seed treatments uh so

1717
01:18:57,439 --> 01:19:02,479
Patrick McMullen is a PhD student in

1718
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:04,479
Chris smarts lab imp Plant Pathology and

1719
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:06,599
has done some really interesting work

1720
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:07,678
and he'll describ this trial which is

1721
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:12,079
behind

1722
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:14,000
us good morning um so I like Larry said

1723
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:16,158
I'm a PhD student in Plant Pathology

1724
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,920
studying soil born pathogens and temp

1725
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:22,158
and their management strategies um and

1726
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:24,399
here I conducted a a small plot trial

1727
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:26,638
looking at fungicide SE treatments to

1728
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:29,039
control damping off and soil born

1729
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:31,639
pathogens so as we've just been hearing

1730
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:36,079
about uh stand establishment is a big

1731
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:38,359
concern for ERS and um now that we know

1732
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:41,679
how to perfectly manage weeds thanks to

1733
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:44,679
Lynn hopefully um another piece of that

1734
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:46,560
puzzle is pathogen management so there's

1735
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:49,079
a number of soil born pathogens that

1736
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,639
hemp is susceptible to including a

1737
01:19:49,079 --> 01:19:53,639
number of species of

1738
01:19:50,639 --> 01:19:55,760
pythium um that we have found here in

1739
01:19:53,639 --> 01:19:59,319
New York other areas of the US have

1740
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:01,400
reported similar uh findings um as well

1741
01:19:59,319 --> 01:20:04,719
as different species of fusarium among

1742
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:07,839
other pathogens uh so most of these

1743
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:09,359
pathogens like pool wet soils like we

1744
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,400
have here in the Northeast early in the

1745
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:14,000
growing season when we're planting um so

1746
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:16,599
as we've heard in some earlier

1747
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,679
presentations soil drainage is super

1748
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:21,560
important uh ensuring that your Fields

1749
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:24,158
aren't planted in lowly spots that flood

1750
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:26,600
easily those are great areas for

1751
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:28,479
pathogens to just Thrive and take off um

1752
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:32,800
if you're planting into wet wet Fields

1753
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:36,479
the pipian will love that um same thing

1754
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:40,520
with ferium they can uh lead to damping

1755
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:43,519
off uh vascular wilts and root and Crown

1756
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:45,280
rods so here I have been testing

1757
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,000
fungicide SE treatments in a

1758
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:49,238
collaborative project with both Larry's

1759
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,840
lab and Alan Taylor's lab a seed

1760
01:20:49,238 --> 01:20:53,439
scientist here at Cornell they

1761
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:56,239
thankfully uh treated the seeds for us

1762
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:58,919
so I used

1763
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:01,638
um several different fungicide SE

1764
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:04,679
treatments there were two that were um

1765
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:08,800
copper hydroxide products americop and

1766
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:12,000
ultum um as well as a phosphite product

1767
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:14,600
and phos phosphorus uh prudent 44 and

1768
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:18,238
neutral and then we compared these to a

1769
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:22,000
conventional fungicide uh treatment of

1770
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:26,079
apron and Maxum which is flu oyal and

1771
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:28,719
methoxy um so the

1772
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:31,119
um the the coppers and phosphates are in

1773
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:33,239
the works of being registered for hemp

1774
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:35,920
but the apron and Maxum is not we were

1775
01:21:33,238 --> 01:21:38,079
using this as a research uh control that

1776
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,119
we expected to work well as it usually

1777
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:42,079
works well on the fungal soilborne

1778
01:21:40,119 --> 01:21:43,039
pathogens as well as the water molds

1779
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:46,639
like

1780
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:48,238
pum um so these seeds were treated and

1781
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:49,520
then planted with a cone Cedar into

1782
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:51,879
these small plot

1783
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:55,040
trials and uh stand counts were

1784
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:56,800
collected 3 weeks after post plan

1785
01:21:55,039 --> 01:22:00,679
as well as 6 weeks and then again at

1786
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:02,719
Harvest um this study we completed fully

1787
01:22:00,679 --> 01:22:04,880
last year and then replicated again this

1788
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:08,239
year that I'm standing in front of um

1789
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:10,639
this year we added a an additional um

1790
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:13,000
formulation of ultum that isn't on the

1791
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:15,520
handout um but is on the field map if

1792
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:19,679
you're looking at that so looking at the

1793
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:23,280
data from last year we saw increases in

1794
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:25,719
Stand counts for all of the Z treatments

1795
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:27,079
um looking at the percent increase I

1796
01:22:25,719 --> 01:22:29,000
should mention we tested this on two

1797
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:32,319
different fiber cultivars so there's

1798
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:35,158
fiber 79 and Futura 83 that Luis talked

1799
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:37,559
a good bit about in our previous

1800
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:38,759
presentations um so we want to test

1801
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:41,280
these on Two

1802
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:43,039
cultivars And we saw numeric increases

1803
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:45,920
in Stand count with all of these

1804
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:48,800
fungicide Z C treatments at 3 weeks post

1805
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:52,639
planting um with only significant

1806
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:55,440
increases um of a 58% increase compared

1807
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:58,400
to the non-re control in ultum and The

1808
01:22:55,439 --> 01:23:01,719
Prudent 44 in neutral treatments so

1809
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:02,679
that's quite a large increase there 58%

1810
01:23:01,719 --> 01:23:05,079
compared to

1811
01:23:02,679 --> 01:23:08,000
non-re however then when we went to the

1812
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:09,840
later uh stand count time points we did

1813
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,319
not see significant increases although

1814
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:16,239
we did still see some numeric

1815
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:19,238
increases um at Harvest we also

1816
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:21,638
collected biomass last year and saw no

1817
01:23:19,238 --> 01:23:24,879
significant increases no significant

1818
01:23:21,639 --> 01:23:26,960
differences in uh plant biomass between

1819
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:30,319
any of the treatments compared to the

1820
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:34,520
controls um so this year we replicated

1821
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:36,639
that and we are also including a um the

1822
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:39,040
same planting density as we did last

1823
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:41,159
year 30 plants per square foot square

1824
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:44,000
feet which is over here on your left

1825
01:23:41,158 --> 01:23:46,839
side and over on your right is a reduced

1826
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,479
planting density of 15 plants per square

1827
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:53,960
fet um we wanted to see if when a C

1828
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:56,718
treatment is applied uh can we use a

1829
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:59,600
lower planting density to therefore use

1830
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:01,920
less seed um will that be will that give

1831
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,760
us an economic gain that we're you know

1832
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,639
putting less seed into the field while

1833
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:08,600
increasing stand establishment um so

1834
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:10,159
those trials are being evaluated

1835
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,120
currently I'm going to be collecting

1836
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:14,759
harest data this coming week so I don't

1837
01:24:12,119 --> 01:24:16,760
have those final numbers for you yet but

1838
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:18,119
all that data should be available next

1839
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:21,400
summer and hopefully give us some

1840
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:24,000
insight into uh the best practices for

1841
01:24:21,399 --> 01:24:27,000
managing sort War pathogens I will say

1842
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:30,639
one interesting thing that I saw in this

1843
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:34,039
year's data was that all of the SE

1844
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:37,600
treatments except for the conventional

1845
01:24:34,039 --> 01:24:40,000
um meth uh apron and maximum treatment

1846
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,039
significantly increased stand count at 3

1847
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,960
weeks post planting so these were the

1848
01:24:42,039 --> 01:24:47,118
copper and phosphite products however

1849
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:52,600
not the conventional fungicides of

1850
01:24:47,118 --> 01:24:54,519
methan oxin and D oxin so um that leads

1851
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,679
us to think maybe there's something else

1852
01:24:54,520 --> 01:25:00,639
at play here other than just soilborne

1853
01:24:56,679 --> 01:25:02,158
pathogens um maybe it's a a nutritional

1854
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:04,000
thing that these extra compounds are

1855
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:05,799
helping with we're not quite sure what's

1856
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,560
going on because we would expect this

1857
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:09,039
conventional fungicide to be quite

1858
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:12,239
effective there's not a lot of known

1859
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:15,560
resistance to it um and it's effective

1860
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:17,799
against uh other soil born pathogens and

1861
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:21,600
other crops that are infected with these

1862
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:22,960
same species so um at this point it

1863
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:25,199
looks like the future outlook for sea

1864
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,800
treatments is quite well for improving

1865
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:30,839
stand count uh stand establishment um

1866
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,239
but we will be looking at some final

1867
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:37,000
data here to see uh differences in

1868
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:39,799
biomass at Harvest as well as uh stem

1869
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:44,800
diameters and uh plant

1870
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:47,119
height um so for now some of the uh best

1871
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:49,719
practices you can do to avoid avoid soil

1872
01:25:47,118 --> 01:25:51,479
born pathogen management is is really uh

1873
01:25:49,719 --> 01:25:54,118
focusing on those cultural practices

1874
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:57,678
right ensuring your well- drained Fields

1875
01:25:54,118 --> 01:26:00,479
um sanitizing your equipment and uh

1876
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:03,760
trying to get a good stand early by

1877
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:05,519
planting at times maybe not right before

1878
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,679
a storm like Larry's pointing out make

1879
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:10,560
sure you're planting in appropriate

1880
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:12,480
weather um so I'd be happy to take any

1881
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,560
questions you might have about pathogen

1882
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:17,158
management yeah I just want to confirm

1883
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:19,840
Patrick we did not apply sonoline to

1884
01:26:17,158 --> 01:26:22,879
this field correct yeah so these fields

1885
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:25,400
were rolled um post uh seating but we

1886
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:28,679
did not apply an herbicide

1887
01:26:25,399 --> 01:26:31,000
so yeah this is an anecdotal observation

1888
01:26:28,679 --> 01:26:33,840
and again you can talk more with Lynn

1889
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,479
about it but when you compare our other

1890
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,760
fields and drive around and see our

1891
01:26:35,479 --> 01:26:39,039
other fields that were treated with

1892
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:42,520
selin compared to this

1893
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:46,238
field uh there's a lot of grass in there

1894
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:48,719
so I'm pretty psyched about Salin it's

1895
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:50,319
pretty seems to be working pretty well

1896
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:54,960
pre-plant

1897
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:58,118
incorporation questions for Patrick

1898
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:00,760
yes which copper uh copper the question

1899
01:26:58,118 --> 01:27:04,198
was which copper this is copper

1900
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:07,039
hydroxide both of them yeah you've been

1901
01:27:04,198 --> 01:27:08,799
mentioning the um attacks eating the

1902
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:12,359
seeds could it actually be that the

1903
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:15,000
application TDE is increasing this 10

1904
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:18,799
actually makes less oh that's a good

1905
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:22,439
question yes uh so the question is uh

1906
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,600
can the the fungicides make the can the

1907
01:27:22,439 --> 01:27:26,919
seed treatment make the seed less

1908
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:28,760
attractive to Birds um yes I think that

1909
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:31,319
can very well be true we don't have data

1910
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:34,639
to support that we didn't test for that

1911
01:27:31,319 --> 01:27:37,238
in experimental design but I do imagine

1912
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:40,079
that the birds are not choosing these F

1913
01:27:37,238 --> 01:27:42,319
side Tria seeds and the the non Tria

1914
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:45,479
control was truly non-treated it didn't

1915
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:49,039
have the film Cod SE

1916
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:49,039
treatment these are some

1917
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:58,238
stem St stem um I have not observed a

1918
01:27:56,039 --> 01:28:02,238
lot of that in my field I haven't really

1919
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:04,678
collected insect data but I think we do

1920
01:28:02,238 --> 01:28:07,638
see but we really don't have that many

1921
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:11,279
stemborers here it's not a an economic

1922
01:28:07,639 --> 01:28:15,000
problem in New York or

1923
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:15,000
grasshoppers for which we are

1924
01:28:15,238 --> 01:28:24,479
thankful okay uh so our next uh series

1925
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:26,279
of yeah thank you Patrick great job

1926
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:29,759
we're now going to move on to a series

1927
01:28:26,279 --> 01:28:34,158
of equipment demonstrations and uh you

1928
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:34,159
we're going to assemble so move

1929
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:41,279
hastily section uh material dri faster R

1930
01:28:40,198 --> 01:28:44,479
more

1931
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:47,679
evenly uh and then ultimately take less

1932
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:49,799
work on your rake and Bor uh to be able

1933
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:52,079
to remove that material once you see the

1934
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:54,840
rake going through you'll start to

1935
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:57,359
understand how 12T stocks are a little

1936
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:59,639
bit challenging for uh that type of

1937
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:01,279
equipment so uh it sounds like the

1938
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:03,840
machine is getting a little bit closer

1939
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:06,158
to us uh so I'll probably have to stop

1940
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:09,520
talking now but if you look over there

1941
01:29:06,158 --> 01:29:09,519
you'll see thech

1942
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:58,279
have something major happen we can be

1943
01:29:56,359 --> 01:30:01,639
there uh I travel around the country and

1944
01:29:58,279 --> 01:30:04,559
fall uh fixing equipment as necessary uh

1945
01:30:01,639 --> 01:30:06,079
working with Growers understanding more

1946
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,360
and what you see behind us is our

1947
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:10,279
current generation of machine uh but

1948
01:30:08,359 --> 01:30:12,439
every year we get better um we're not a

1949
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:15,279
very complacent company I get bored

1950
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:17,118
quickly I like to see stuff uh evolve

1951
01:30:15,279 --> 01:30:18,759
and so we're going to continue to evolve

1952
01:30:17,118 --> 01:30:21,158
uh pieces of equipment like this as an

1953
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:22,840
industry changes but I also want to make

1954
01:30:21,158 --> 01:30:24,319
uh people aware that that while we do

1955
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:26,679
develop this machine this is at the end

1956
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:28,198
all be all of how to have Harvest H I

1957
01:30:26,679 --> 01:30:30,000
think that there's a lot of application

1958
01:30:28,198 --> 01:30:31,799
for for this type of machine in the

1959
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,800
country but there's other types of

1960
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:36,000
implements out there that that can work

1961
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:39,119
as well we've developed equipment for

1962
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,840
fors Harvesters uh that can wind R uh

1963
01:30:39,118 --> 01:30:42,639
material and then you can go back and

1964
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:44,199
pick that up really just depends on what

1965
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,400
your application is going to be what

1966
01:30:44,198 --> 01:30:47,759
you're going to Market with and that's

1967
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:49,439
that's what you got to think about when

1968
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,600
you're you're looking at growing hemp

1969
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:53,719
when you're looking at uh processing

1970
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,800
hemp what what's the end result need to

1971
01:30:53,719 --> 01:30:57,158
be and then work that backwards and you

1972
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,800
usually get to the right equipment if

1973
01:30:57,158 --> 01:31:01,198
you started the equipment first and work

1974
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,560
it Forward uh you'll often times run

1975
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:04,839
into some bottlenecks that are really

1976
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,159
hard to accomplish so um this is just

1977
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:09,520
one aspect of it and I want to thank

1978
01:31:07,158 --> 01:31:12,559
Larry uh for letting us run the machine

1979
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:14,480
today and uh uh being a part of what we

1980
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:16,320
do with Bish Enterprises and I'm I'm

1981
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:19,399
proud to be a part of what what people

1982
01:31:16,319 --> 01:31:22,399
are doing you here at Cornel University

1983
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:24,559
can I uh yeah you can thank you Andrew

1984
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:26,839
so you can see

1985
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:28,360
that on this side I had a few more

1986
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:31,000
cutting issues if you look to the other

1987
01:31:28,359 --> 01:31:33,439
side it's actually a very clean cut and

1988
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,600
so crop conditions are very important

1989
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:36,879
for your Harvest uh you'll know some of

1990
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,880
you might have noticed we were cutting a

1991
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:40,400
bit this morning it was really wet this

1992
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,440
morning it was a little more difficult

1993
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:44,319
than it should have been an 8: a.m.

1994
01:31:42,439 --> 01:31:47,118
Harvest is definitely different from a 2

1995
01:31:44,319 --> 01:31:48,880
p.m. Harvest uh and this is something

1996
01:31:47,118 --> 01:31:51,439
I've noticed with all of the field it's

1997
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:54,440
been a lot harder to harvest traveling

1998
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:56,479
to the north where to the South

1999
01:31:54,439 --> 01:31:58,158
uh it's a much cleaner cut the crop

2000
01:31:56,479 --> 01:32:00,000
Falls where it's supposed to in this

2001
01:31:58,158 --> 01:32:02,519
direction it tends to get pushed and I

2002
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,319
get a little bit more lodging um you'll

2003
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:06,560
notice I'm adjusting the height of the

2004
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:08,759
machine up and down uh obviously you

2005
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,960
want to get as low of a cut as possible

2006
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:12,679
to get as much tonnage but in some

2007
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,480
situations you might have planted too

2008
01:32:12,679 --> 01:32:16,639
densely the crop might be too moist and

2009
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:19,000
you have to cut a couple inches above

2010
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:20,639
just to keep that crop flowing smoothly

2011
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,158
uh so there's a lot of infield

2012
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:25,840
conditions you have to be aware of

2013
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:25,839
outside of the machine itself

2014
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:32,559
okay Andrew didn't mention this jacob

2015
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,639
didn't mention it either but uh this

2016
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:37,800
machine

2017
01:32:33,639 --> 01:32:40,880
broke uh what 3 weeks ago uh yeah it

2018
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:42,679
broke as I was going to park it uh I

2019
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:46,520
finished all my cutting everything went

2020
01:32:42,679 --> 01:32:49,480
well uh and then I had a weld fail and

2021
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:52,280
steel fell on the ground uh so that was

2022
01:32:49,479 --> 01:32:54,279
a bit of a repair took me some time uh

2023
01:32:52,279 --> 01:32:56,359
we actually have the parts we show

2024
01:32:54,279 --> 01:32:58,519
people later anyone wants to see that

2025
01:32:56,359 --> 01:33:01,079
damage um but the most important thing

2026
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:02,840
as Andrew said uh is we do stand behind

2027
01:33:01,079 --> 01:33:04,679
our equipment and so I was able to make

2028
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:07,000
a call I was able to get something

2029
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:09,000
fabricated uh and I was able to have my

2030
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,800
part some time to continue harvesting

2031
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,238
and most importantly to show it off to

2032
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:15,679
you all here today so yeah so I gave

2033
01:33:13,238 --> 01:33:17,559
Andrew a call and he said yep we're

2034
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:20,639
making a new tongue for you we'll have

2035
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:22,880
that to you in a few days and he said

2036
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:25,760
you know normally I question the

2037
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,760
operator about

2038
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:30,000
but in this case I guess I can't really

2039
01:33:27,479 --> 01:33:33,158
do that my

2040
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:35,238
bad so again we really appreciate uh the

2041
01:33:33,158 --> 01:33:38,079
support of this Enterprises and I also

2042
01:33:35,238 --> 01:33:40,919
want to take a minute here to thank

2043
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:43,719
Andrew as the leader of the empty

2044
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:48,079
Coalition and for all of his efforts

2045
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:48,079
tireless efforts in getting that first

2046
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:54,480
application I think we're we're already

2047
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,239
working on the next

2048
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:58,479
application uh for for beef cattle is

2049
01:33:57,238 --> 01:34:00,519
that right you want to say a few words

2050
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:02,439
about pemp be coalition Andrew yeah

2051
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:04,960
that's my one of my favorite subjects in

2052
01:34:02,439 --> 01:34:07,039
the world I think it's the uh largest

2053
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,840
opportunity to the hemp industry is to

2054
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:11,279
open up the animal feed Market it's

2055
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:13,400
going to reduce the cost of production

2056
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:16,880
across the board whether you're whether

2057
01:34:13,399 --> 01:34:19,799
you're growing for herd fiber grain can

2058
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:21,279
avonoid doesn't matter uh animal feed is

2059
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:23,360
going to lower the cost of production

2060
01:34:21,279 --> 01:34:26,359
across the board uh I've been involved

2061
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:28,920
with the feed Coalition uh for going on

2062
01:34:26,359 --> 01:34:31,839
uh almost 5 years now we worked on the

2063
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:34,480
eggl chicken application uh for just

2064
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:37,119
over three and a half years this year uh

2065
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:41,279
we received a a recommendation from the

2066
01:34:37,118 --> 01:34:44,079
FDA back in February uh AFCO uh voted in

2067
01:34:41,279 --> 01:34:47,559
favor of this um at their F at their

2068
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:51,079
annual meeting in San Antonio uh Texas

2069
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:53,080
in August and so now the market is is

2070
01:34:51,079 --> 01:34:55,399
opened up it's federally legal to feed

2071
01:34:53,079 --> 01:34:58,920
egg Lane chickens hemp seed meal it's

2072
01:34:55,399 --> 01:35:01,519
federally legal to uh have that material

2073
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:04,840
cross borders um no no interstate

2074
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:06,920
commerce issues it's not a state uh it's

2075
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:09,159
not a state regulation this is federal

2076
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:11,600
so that's really exciting and and

2077
01:35:09,158 --> 01:35:13,118
Larry's Point what's next uh because we

2078
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:16,360
can't stop with eggl chickens although

2079
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:19,079
eggl chickens interestingly enough 5% if

2080
01:35:16,359 --> 01:35:23,238
we impact 5% of the egg Lan chicken

2081
01:35:19,079 --> 01:35:24,198
Market that's 670,000 needed Acres of

2082
01:35:23,238 --> 01:35:26,158
hem

2083
01:35:24,198 --> 01:35:28,638
uh to be grown in the United States just

2084
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:32,679
for egg L chickens not Bo chickens not

2085
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:35,039
roosters just egg layers so what's next

2086
01:35:32,679 --> 01:35:37,880
is beef cattle beef cattle and lamb are

2087
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:39,840
up on the docket um we think we'll have

2088
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:41,600
uh an expedited result with those we

2089
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:44,440
have a tremendous amount of research

2090
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:46,239
data uh available for those the fa

2091
01:35:44,439 --> 01:35:48,678
actually came to us and said that they

2092
01:35:46,238 --> 01:35:51,000
felt that our data was sufficient enough

2093
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:52,880
uh to push an application through uh

2094
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,079
without any further studies and that's

2095
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,000
really positive to have that

2096
01:35:54,079 --> 01:35:58,800
relationship now with the FDA to move

2097
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:01,319
these along so hopefully within about 24

2098
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:04,600
months uh maybe 30 months we we could

2099
01:36:01,319 --> 01:36:06,639
see beef cattle approved um in in the

2100
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:08,520
United States uh beyond that we're

2101
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:10,560
looking at equin uh we've got some

2102
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:13,760
studies going on with equine and also

2103
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:16,920
looking at uh the holes and how uh

2104
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:19,360
horses um benefit from the holes of the

2105
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:22,118
seed uh which which currently uh we

2106
01:36:19,359 --> 01:36:24,839
don't have a market for at all and

2107
01:36:22,118 --> 01:36:28,359
beyond that then uh broilers we are

2108
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:30,360
doing some work with broilers um and as

2109
01:36:28,359 --> 01:36:31,719
many animals as we can get studied on

2110
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:33,439
we're going to continue to push this

2111
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:36,880
forward so if you want to see the

2112
01:36:33,439 --> 01:36:38,638
industry grow uh contribute to the hemp

2113
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:41,279
feed Coalition we're a good group of

2114
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:44,400
people um we spend all of our money on

2115
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:45,920
studies uh on application and and making

2116
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:50,359
things happen for the hemp industry and

2117
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:50,359
thank you Larry for uh bringing up our

2118
01:36:50,449 --> 01:36:57,079
[Applause]

2119
01:36:55,118 --> 01:37:00,559
and again with generous funding from New

2120
01:36:57,079 --> 01:37:03,399
York State uh Cornell is initiated three

2121
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:05,239
uh animal feeding studies uh with

2122
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:07,118
matching funds from the foundation for

2123
01:37:05,238 --> 01:37:09,238
food and agricultural research so a

2124
01:37:07,118 --> 01:37:13,439
total of

2125
01:37:09,238 --> 01:37:18,638
$500,000 and we will do a study on dairy

2126
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:19,638
cows um boiler chickens and an e stud

2127
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:22,639
with

2128
01:37:19,639 --> 01:37:24,039
Hy uh and we hope again to cooperate

2129
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:26,880
with IND hemp

2130
01:37:24,039 --> 01:37:30,118
uh to provide that hemp seed meal uh as

2131
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:32,480
a member of the FF hemp research

2132
01:37:30,118 --> 01:37:35,519
Coalition uh so it really is a team

2133
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:39,519
effort and I'm glad we were finally able

2134
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:39,520
to get our animal scientists on board

2135
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:54,880
at Okay so we've cut our fiber hemp now

2136
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:57,920
the next step is to let it w and dry

2137
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:59,679
and uh you can go see how wet you can

2138
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:02,199
walk through the field here but I wanted

2139
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:06,599
to give an opportunity uh to our guest

2140
01:38:02,198 --> 01:38:10,079
from Poland uh Na kski hopefully my

2141
01:38:06,599 --> 01:38:13,079
polish is somewhat acceptable him his

2142
01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:15,559
name uh who's going to talk about uh his

2143
01:38:13,079 --> 01:38:18,479
experience in Poland with reading and

2144
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:21,239
his company and uh the potential for

2145
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:24,158
using him for

2146
01:38:21,238 --> 01:38:25,839
Tex thank you and for

2147
01:38:24,158 --> 01:38:30,039
wondering how to pronounce my name is

2148
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:32,440
Magic um I've been asked to to introduce

2149
01:38:30,039 --> 01:38:33,920
to share my experiences with uh what

2150
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:36,839
we're doing in Poland which is basically

2151
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:39,000
a vertically integrated company which uh

2152
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:41,360
gross hand we Harvest it we decorticated

2153
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,960
ourselves we cotton IE it mechanically

2154
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:45,118
blend it with cotton spin it into your

2155
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:48,039
arm and make products the end products

2156
01:38:45,118 --> 01:38:49,719
that you can actually wear so um

2157
01:38:48,039 --> 01:38:53,198
afterwards or in the meantime you can

2158
01:38:49,719 --> 01:38:55,599
just compare that um stro which is still

2159
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:58,839
the same thing that uh Jacob just cut

2160
01:38:55,599 --> 01:39:02,760
down like probably like two 3 weeks ago

2161
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:05,960
um and it is supposed to be red uh it is

2162
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:07,920
somehow red uh what I want to share

2163
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:10,239
about is among the 10 years that I've

2164
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,960
been growing H for different

2165
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:14,198
applications for five years I'm focused

2166
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:15,920
solely on fiber and when I say fiber

2167
01:39:14,198 --> 01:39:18,719
when Europeans say fiber they usually

2168
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:22,079
mean what you're calling B uh not her

2169
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:26,239
not the other applications so um The Bu

2170
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:27,760
should um separate easily from the her

2171
01:39:26,238 --> 01:39:29,799
you can see that happening with the

2172
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:31,560
green one that's why the a lot of people

2173
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:34,800
are saying about green decortication

2174
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:38,320
because you can actually get a clean um

2175
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:40,079
strand of bust uh without any shifts the

2176
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:43,319
problem with that is that you're

2177
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:45,279
actually left with 75% of water which is

2178
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:49,238
the average content of of water both in

2179
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:51,399
fiber in in the in the B and in the her

2180
01:39:49,238 --> 01:39:55,279
and while it is technically speaking

2181
01:39:51,399 --> 01:39:57,319
quite easy to separate the green um but

2182
01:39:55,279 --> 01:40:00,519
then you need to find an application for

2183
01:39:57,319 --> 01:40:02,118
75% water in the her or you have to dry

2184
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:04,480
it artificially you cannot dry it in the

2185
01:40:02,118 --> 01:40:07,118
field because you won't pick it up so uh

2186
01:40:04,479 --> 01:40:08,879
what we uh started doing 10 years ago is

2187
01:40:07,118 --> 01:40:10,799
winter reting which was done

2188
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:13,159
accidentally by just forgetting or

2189
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:16,320
actually not being able to harvest 200

2190
01:40:13,158 --> 01:40:19,719
of our Acres of of hand grown something

2191
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:21,920
else um what is essentially happening

2192
01:40:19,719 --> 01:40:23,800
during winter is what happens in the

2193
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:26,840
very traditional method of of water

2194
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:28,760
reting which means allowing water to

2195
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:30,039
dissolve the glue that is holding it

2196
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:32,239
together that's what we're doing in a

2197
01:40:30,039 --> 01:40:34,079
duting du reting means you actually

2198
01:40:32,238 --> 01:40:35,678
leave it on the ground break it

2199
01:40:34,079 --> 01:40:39,000
sometimes depending on the weather and

2200
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:42,399
allow the the moisture to set to to Aid

2201
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:45,880
you in separating the um the bast from

2202
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:48,198
the heart the better you do your rting

2203
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:49,960
the easier your decortication will be

2204
01:40:48,198 --> 01:40:51,879
and the easier the cortication will be

2205
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:54,599
the higher the quality of the end fiber

2206
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:56,199
will be uh I see I've been traveling

2207
01:40:54,599 --> 01:40:57,920
across the United States for three and a

2208
01:40:56,198 --> 01:41:00,960
half weeks now visiting different

2209
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:03,920
decortication facilities and I see not a

2210
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:05,880
lot of people uh having a a a full

2211
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:08,279
picture from the field from the sea

2212
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:10,560
there's plenty of uh great knowledge

2213
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:14,759
here about what happens in at emergence

2214
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:17,840
rate what how to allow for the best um

2215
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:19,679
count of of the plans but not those

2216
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:21,560
people that have that knowledge usually

2217
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:24,199
don't have knowledge about processing

2218
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:26,320
processing and and the other

2219
01:41:24,198 --> 01:41:27,279
thing holds true as well people that are

2220
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:29,238
great with

2221
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:30,800
decortication sometimes even tell I

2222
01:41:29,238 --> 01:41:32,439
don't care about farming well they

2223
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:34,679
should because if they don't do the

2224
01:41:32,439 --> 01:41:36,359
reting properly they will not do the

2225
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:38,199
decortication properly and if they don't

2226
01:41:36,359 --> 01:41:40,920
do decortication properly the only thing

2227
01:41:38,198 --> 01:41:43,279
they can do with the fiber is insulation

2228
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:46,480
um so how does it actually work what

2229
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:49,759
what are the um the inner works of of of

2230
01:41:46,479 --> 01:41:52,158
our uh process we um we are in a

2231
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:54,480
latitude of 55 North which is closer to

2232
01:41:52,158 --> 01:41:56,759
admont so Upstate New York is the

2233
01:41:54,479 --> 01:41:58,879
closest thing that I have to to European

2234
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,840
conditions to polish conditions uh and

2235
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:03,079
you can see the the differences that lar

2236
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:06,239
mentioned earlier about the maturity of

2237
01:42:03,079 --> 01:42:08,158
the plants since we are not cutting down

2238
01:42:06,238 --> 01:42:10,158
our plants we let them die with the

2239
01:42:08,158 --> 01:42:12,439
first Frost which comes around mid

2240
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:14,279
October so Ursa Alpha would be actually

2241
01:42:12,439 --> 01:42:17,000
The Marvelous plant for us because it

2242
01:42:14,279 --> 01:42:18,960
would die off without being mature it is

2243
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,880
obviously true that the more mature the

2244
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:24,079
plant is the stiffer the fiber is but

2245
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:26,400
it's not exactly about maturity itself

2246
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:29,319
it's about the weight that it carries so

2247
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:32,359
if it's an mature plant that wents into

2248
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:35,880
flowering but has actually pretty small

2249
01:42:32,359 --> 01:42:38,519
amount of of of grain the the head will

2250
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:41,239
be light and it will not go into that

2251
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:43,239
lignification that that strongly so we

2252
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:45,039
are growing and and that's something

2253
01:42:43,238 --> 01:42:48,919
that I would recommend you to try

2254
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:51,000
especially in the upstate New York um to

2255
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:53,599
get as late blooming varieties as

2256
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,359
possible plant them April May or

2257
01:42:53,599 --> 01:42:56,119
whatever and forget him for 11 and a

2258
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:59,439
half

2259
01:42:56,118 --> 01:43:01,359
months just you can do pictures for for

2260
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:06,879
your Facebook feed or whatever but

2261
01:43:01,359 --> 01:43:09,238
nothing else um nature will take uh

2262
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:11,118
control of it and actually all the all

2263
01:43:09,238 --> 01:43:14,759
the water that is falling from the sky

2264
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:16,479
whether it's um snow or rain or Dew is

2265
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:18,119
actually entering the stalks but the

2266
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:20,198
important part is that they remain

2267
01:43:18,118 --> 01:43:22,238
standing some people call it standing

2268
01:43:20,198 --> 01:43:25,118
writing because if you cut it down like

2269
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:28,039
that and leave it till April it will all

2270
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:30,039
mold you it will over R rting

2271
01:43:28,039 --> 01:43:32,800
essentially goes from rotting it's it's

2272
01:43:30,039 --> 01:43:35,479
a form of of rotting it's actually

2273
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:39,119
that's microbiological processing here

2274
01:43:35,479 --> 01:43:41,839
right um so what we see with the crop

2275
01:43:39,118 --> 01:43:45,000
that is left standing in a field it gets

2276
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:47,279
wet and then it's dried With the Wind so

2277
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,238
it's actually a sort of water rating but

2278
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:51,079
in the field the benefits of that are

2279
01:43:49,238 --> 01:43:54,198
you're not using any energy you're not

2280
01:43:51,079 --> 01:43:55,920
using any water H all the affluent water

2281
01:43:54,198 --> 01:43:57,960
that takes all those glues which

2282
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:00,239
contains plenty of nitrogen actually

2283
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:02,319
stays in your field instead of polluting

2284
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:06,118
our rivers or whatever you do with the

2285
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:08,519
water from way uh from water rting and

2286
01:44:06,118 --> 01:44:10,399
then it's much easier to decorticate the

2287
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:12,679
only thing you have to do to decorticate

2288
01:44:10,399 --> 01:44:16,359
the fiber like that it's like if I would

2289
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:18,239
pick up a winter rated piece of stro I

2290
01:44:16,359 --> 01:44:19,719
would be left with piece of Bast in my

2291
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:21,919
hand and all the heart will be falling

2292
01:44:19,719 --> 01:44:24,079
down it's no longer separated to each

2293
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:25,960
other you need zero energy to separate

2294
01:44:24,079 --> 01:44:29,679
it so the only thing you actually need

2295
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:32,760
to do is to see it sift it just separate

2296
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:34,960
it mechanically so how do we Harvest it

2297
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:37,199
uh someone was saying that if we allow

2298
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:39,198
the males to die off in a field then

2299
01:44:37,198 --> 01:44:41,399
they get dry and they get entangled in a

2300
01:44:39,198 --> 01:44:43,759
combined Harvester that's all true with

2301
01:44:41,399 --> 01:44:46,598
dry material it's much more difficult to

2302
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:48,800
cut it with anything so we don't cut it

2303
01:44:46,599 --> 01:44:52,440
at all we just rake it

2304
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:54,639
our most advanced piece of equipment is

2305
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:57,359
standing right right there just a

2306
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:59,599
regular rake like really the simplest

2307
01:44:57,359 --> 01:45:02,920
rake possible we just enter it into the

2308
01:44:59,599 --> 01:45:05,159
standing field and and it just creates a

2309
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:07,880
windro without actually cutting the

2310
01:45:05,158 --> 01:45:10,039
plants down two things are happening

2311
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:13,199
either the plants are being pulled off

2312
01:45:10,039 --> 01:45:15,238
including the piece of of root that

2313
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:18,000
plenty of people say about this huge

2314
01:45:15,238 --> 01:45:19,319
root system that hemp has true but

2315
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,359
actually the one that you're pulling out

2316
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:23,559
is like an inch long and it has some

2317
01:45:22,359 --> 01:45:26,198
heart

2318
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:28,760
it has some Bast fiber which is of poor

2319
01:45:26,198 --> 01:45:30,719
quality but it's still you still get it

2320
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:32,360
um the other thing that might be

2321
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:34,399
happening is it breaks at the bottom

2322
01:45:32,359 --> 01:45:36,598
because with all the snow that at least

2323
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:39,479
in our part of the country we are having

2324
01:45:36,599 --> 01:45:41,159
snow in the winter usually uh with all

2325
01:45:39,479 --> 01:45:42,879
the snow at the very bottom the plants

2326
01:45:41,158 --> 01:45:44,879
become too brittle you cannot actually

2327
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:47,159
Harvest it when it's freezing because if

2328
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,840
it's freezing the plants become brittle

2329
01:45:47,158 --> 01:45:52,279
and you're actually destroying it um the

2330
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:54,840
smaller the simpler the slower The Rake

2331
01:45:52,279 --> 01:45:56,759
is the better for the fiber you just

2332
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:59,400
making a wind draw and then just bailing

2333
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:02,159
it the very important remark is it all

2334
01:45:59,399 --> 01:46:04,759
depends on your processor uh during the

2335
01:46:02,158 --> 01:46:07,559
the pen State event that Lara mentioned

2336
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:11,560
David suchu gave a very

2337
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:12,960
um important remark that it's what you

2338
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:14,760
what the farmer wants is what your

2339
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,719
processor wants it's actually you're

2340
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:19,000
doing it for the buyer that is actually

2341
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:21,480
taking the fiber from you so even if

2342
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,520
it's easier for you it's easier for them

2343
01:46:21,479 --> 01:46:26,039
it depends on what sort of line do they

2344
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:28,119
have of what sort of bail opener do they

2345
01:46:26,039 --> 01:46:31,639
have and what's the end application of

2346
01:46:28,118 --> 01:46:34,118
it um all the stuff that is being

2347
01:46:31,639 --> 01:46:37,319
removed by rain water by snow and also

2348
01:46:34,118 --> 01:46:40,158
by water swelling when water freezes it

2349
01:46:37,319 --> 01:46:43,238
increases its volume when the water is

2350
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:46,359
inside the the strand of Bast fiber that

2351
01:46:43,238 --> 01:46:48,638
that's basically fiber right but um a

2352
01:46:46,359 --> 01:46:50,519
lot of people say about long fiber that

2353
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:52,599
technique is not applicable for long

2354
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:53,360
fiber at all it's only for short fiber

2355
01:46:52,599 --> 01:46:56,039
but

2356
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:57,639
actually I'm in the my minority in the H

2357
01:46:56,039 --> 01:46:59,399
industry claiming that there is no such

2358
01:46:57,639 --> 01:47:01,359
thing as one fiber there is only a

2359
01:46:59,399 --> 01:47:02,960
bundle of fibers that might belong

2360
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:04,759
because the individual fibers if you

2361
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:08,359
just separate it and then you see those

2362
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:10,159
small white tiny things can just

2363
01:47:08,359 --> 01:47:14,279
everyone can grab a piece and look at it

2364
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:16,598
later and those small white pieces of

2365
01:47:14,279 --> 01:47:19,399
something those are actually hand fibers

2366
01:47:16,599 --> 01:47:20,960
they're an inch long inch and a half and

2367
01:47:19,399 --> 01:47:23,198
that's what what you're witnessing with

2368
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:24,920
cotton so we are using a cotton system

2369
01:47:23,198 --> 01:47:27,238
despite being a country where there's no

2370
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:30,520
cotton at all uh so the United States

2371
01:47:27,238 --> 01:47:32,319
has a huge industry that used to process

2372
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:33,719
more cotton than they do I I don't know

2373
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:35,840
the volumes but basically you have

2374
01:47:33,719 --> 01:47:38,359
plenty of equipment that might be used

2375
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:41,039
for cotton uh which is used for cotton

2376
01:47:38,359 --> 01:47:43,479
in some places um I've been actually in

2377
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:46,679
in some refabric cotton jeans that are

2378
01:47:43,479 --> 01:47:48,519
doing it um one of of our colleagues

2379
01:47:46,679 --> 01:47:50,840
when I mentioned the winter wrting

2380
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:53,000
process to him a year ago now he

2381
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:54,760
actually did all the Acres this way and

2382
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,319
he says he's actually having a lower

2383
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:58,679
electricity Bild because he doesn't

2384
01:47:56,319 --> 01:48:01,319
really need to break all that stuff the

2385
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:02,960
line can be shorter because even after

2386
01:48:01,319 --> 01:48:04,719
the most expensive decortication

2387
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:06,439
equipment ever if you don't do your

2388
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:09,960
wetting properly you will end up with

2389
01:48:06,439 --> 01:48:11,319
fiber contaminated with lots of um hers

2390
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:13,079
which might be good for some

2391
01:48:11,319 --> 01:48:15,559
applications but it's definitely not

2392
01:48:13,079 --> 01:48:17,399
good for um textile application for

2393
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:20,560
textile application if you use the short

2394
01:48:17,399 --> 01:48:23,079
fiber setup which is basically opening

2395
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:25,159
the fibers mechanically Garing them ing

2396
01:48:23,079 --> 01:48:28,800
them whatever you call it you separate

2397
01:48:25,158 --> 01:48:31,079
it into individual fibers and where does

2398
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,760
the de gaming process comes in into all

2399
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:35,198
that a lot of people are saying about D

2400
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:37,400
gaming D gaming is basically covering

2401
01:48:35,198 --> 01:48:40,879
your mistakes at reting that's the way I

2402
01:48:37,399 --> 01:48:43,079
see it h a lot of people I hear now are

2403
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:45,359
are interested in green decorticated

2404
01:48:43,079 --> 01:48:47,399
fiber which is which has zero reading

2405
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:50,439
and in that case in order to use it to

2406
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:52,839
anything you need to undergo a de gaming

2407
01:48:50,439 --> 01:48:54,598
process which is basically making the

2408
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:57,159
same thing that winter does for me I'm

2409
01:48:54,599 --> 01:48:58,880
calling it semi deam because it still

2410
01:48:57,158 --> 01:49:02,399
doesn't remove all the liins it still

2411
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:05,400
doesn't remove everything but uh winter

2412
01:49:02,399 --> 01:49:07,839
red hemp is actually much better uh for

2413
01:49:05,399 --> 01:49:10,839
textile from my perspective using my

2414
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:12,520
equipment than anything that's ever seen

2415
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:14,760
it can be done all over across the

2416
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:16,520
United States even where people don't

2417
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:18,440
know they did winter rating they did

2418
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:21,119
winter rating I've collected some

2419
01:49:18,439 --> 01:49:22,399
samples this April from North Dakota

2420
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:24,479
which is like probably closer in

2421
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:26,598
latitude to here but also from

2422
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:28,678
California we actually spawn those

2423
01:49:26,599 --> 01:49:30,319
fibers despite people saying don't take

2424
01:49:28,679 --> 01:49:32,679
that that's that's just our mistake we

2425
01:49:30,319 --> 01:49:35,719
just forgot to harvest it I've seen

2426
01:49:32,679 --> 01:49:38,079
winter red hemp in California H which is

2427
01:49:35,719 --> 01:49:39,840
absolutely perfect it doesn't look very

2428
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:43,000
well like if you compare what you seeing

2429
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:44,560
in the field and you compare to this it

2430
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:47,039
also doesn't look very well right it's

2431
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,800
it's not what you're uh selling on on

2432
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:51,639
advertisement of hemp that doesn't

2433
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:53,320
really look like hemp but well you also

2434
01:49:51,639 --> 01:49:56,920
don't want to see how most of the things

2435
01:49:53,319 --> 01:49:58,639
are being done in between uh so um the

2436
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:00,399
um the winter wrting process is

2437
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:02,359
something that you definitely can try in

2438
01:50:00,399 --> 01:50:05,000
here I don't know how I'm looking at

2439
01:50:02,359 --> 01:50:06,839
TimeWise but probably judging by Larry's

2440
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,079
approaching me it's probably closer to

2441
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:10,880
the end uh so if you have any questions

2442
01:50:09,079 --> 01:50:13,679
I'm feel free to ask them now or I will

2443
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:16,420
be staying here until the end of uh the

2444
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:22,739
day today thank you

2445
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:22,739
[Applause]

2446
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:27,279
did you use just a standard rake and

2447
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:29,519
just drive it slower or did you have

2448
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:32,319
specialized equipment for your harvest

2449
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,440
in say January or March or whenever you

2450
01:50:32,319 --> 01:50:35,519
did it I don't want to use any

2451
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:36,960
specialized equipment because if you

2452
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:38,760
want to scale it up and you want to

2453
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,359
convince Farmers you want them to use

2454
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:43,440
whatever they have so it was the very

2455
01:50:40,359 --> 01:50:46,198
regular rake um one important thing is

2456
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:48,238
is the variety obviously you cannot um

2457
01:50:46,198 --> 01:50:49,719
choose any but with the rake literally

2458
01:50:48,238 --> 01:50:51,559
you can choose any actually one of my

2459
01:50:49,719 --> 01:50:52,719
Farmers because we grow 100 acres

2460
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:54,960
ourselves and we also have some some

2461
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:57,118
Farmers growing it for us used a larger

2462
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:59,880
rake and it was actually worse because

2463
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:01,799
with a larger rake the the force with

2464
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:05,118
which it was hitting the plant was

2465
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:08,440
bigger and it actually uh did some of

2466
01:51:05,118 --> 01:51:10,799
the it broke too many stems while it was

2467
01:51:08,439 --> 01:51:13,439
happening so a lot of shifts a lot of HT

2468
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:16,679
was left uh on the ground so obviously I

2469
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:18,559
cannot achieve the speed at which uh the

2470
01:51:16,679 --> 01:51:21,039
B brothers are doing it that's that's

2471
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:23,920
impossible for me I'm I'm cutting a two

2472
01:51:21,039 --> 01:51:25,198
to three acres an hour tops when it

2473
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:27,760
comes to length if that's what you

2474
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:30,559
wanted to ask the higher the better like

2475
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:33,719
I know some processors don't want long

2476
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:35,560
um stems in their in their um Pro

2477
01:51:33,719 --> 01:51:38,760
because they are stiff like if you want

2478
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:41,039
to um bail even bail something like that

2479
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:43,000
it was just going to stand I don't know

2480
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:45,439
English word for it but this way and and

2481
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:47,560
it just doesn't get up in in the Bor in

2482
01:51:45,439 --> 01:51:49,359
our case it's already brittle already

2483
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:51,199
soft so it doesn't really matter I'm

2484
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:54,719
using the Bales with the whole length

2485
01:51:51,198 --> 01:51:57,439
which is like 15 16 fet tall and then is

2486
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:59,480
being separated at the um carding

2487
01:51:57,439 --> 01:52:01,678
opening stage which is basically drums

2488
01:51:59,479 --> 01:52:04,879
with pin rollers and whatever you have

2489
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:07,239
at at the cotton genin can easily with

2490
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:08,719
slight modification open even the

2491
01:52:07,238 --> 01:52:12,718
longest Str of

2492
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:14,520
fiber question comment on fiber

2493
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:17,198
discoloration from

2494
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,599
cladosporium uh it is essentially close

2495
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:22,118
to Black when we take it from the field

2496
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:24,599
which might uh well it does indicate

2497
01:52:22,118 --> 01:52:26,719
some microbial uh infection you might

2498
01:52:24,599 --> 01:52:28,440
call it or whatever but actually for

2499
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:31,599
textile production which is our sole

2500
01:52:28,439 --> 01:52:34,279
Focus uh first when you open it up

2501
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:38,599
everything goes into the dust bin so the

2502
01:52:34,279 --> 01:52:40,759
most uh problematic part of that is the

2503
01:52:38,599 --> 01:52:42,319
health and safety of the emplo employees

2504
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:45,480
actually doing that because all that

2505
01:52:42,319 --> 01:52:47,920
dust contains some fungi that you don't

2506
01:52:45,479 --> 01:52:51,198
want to introduce into your LS uh but

2507
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:53,279
then all the um mechanical processes

2508
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:54,919
there are some fibers that are over red

2509
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:57,559
when they're totally black that usually

2510
01:52:54,920 --> 01:53:00,560
means the strength is lower the strength

2511
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:02,480
of the winter red hemp will be lower but

2512
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,719
you don't actually go for klar

2513
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:05,279
applications you go for cotton

2514
01:53:03,719 --> 01:53:09,840
applications cotton is not a very strong

2515
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:11,960
fiber um so the the um the weaken spots

2516
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:13,920
will actually be destroyed in in the

2517
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:15,000
process in the mechanical processing and

2518
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,158
then the

2519
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,920
microbiological issues will be solved

2520
01:53:17,158 --> 01:53:21,039
when the the yarn is finished and you

2521
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:23,560
weave it into fabric fabric is always

2522
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:25,639
being water treated uh this was

2523
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:28,760
sanforized which is like uh going

2524
01:53:25,639 --> 01:53:31,840
through the boiling water so it's we

2525
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:34,159
don't really see it as as an issue ra

2526
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:35,639
except except for the part of health and

2527
01:53:34,158 --> 01:53:38,839
safety of the employee which has to be

2528
01:53:35,639 --> 01:53:41,800
accounted for thank

2529
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:43,920
you I have just one more I have kind of

2530
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:47,000
two questions one uh so does winter

2531
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:48,359
reting not eliminate the ligman uh is

2532
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,599
that what you're saying and then my

2533
01:53:48,359 --> 01:53:53,639
other question is what do you do with

2534
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:56,960
the residual waste actually uh take out

2535
01:53:53,639 --> 01:53:58,400
um well uh does it take all the ligin no

2536
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:00,399
it doesn't take all the ligin you can

2537
01:53:58,399 --> 01:54:03,078
still run it through chemical de gaming

2538
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:06,238
and still see some uh delignification

2539
01:54:03,078 --> 01:54:07,880
but I I I'm not an academic I just get

2540
01:54:06,238 --> 01:54:09,479
my fiber through the spinning meal we

2541
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:11,319
have that comfort of actually being able

2542
01:54:09,479 --> 01:54:13,319
to run even several kilos through the

2543
01:54:11,319 --> 01:54:15,359
whole process and see if the end result

2544
01:54:13,319 --> 01:54:17,078
is good for me I don't really care if

2545
01:54:15,359 --> 01:54:20,039
there's ligin still left in it if it's

2546
01:54:17,078 --> 01:54:22,118
soft enough for me to wear and I'm happy

2547
01:54:20,039 --> 01:54:24,920
with it then then I'm happy with it when

2548
01:54:22,118 --> 01:54:28,880
it comes to to waste there is not really

2549
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:30,920
any waste well during the um this the

2550
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:33,039
the standing rting obviously all of the

2551
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:34,440
fibers all all the all of the flowers

2552
01:54:33,039 --> 01:54:36,479
all of the grains falling down to the

2553
01:54:34,439 --> 01:54:38,479
ground or feeding the birds which

2554
01:54:36,479 --> 01:54:40,078
actually made me thinking when uh during

2555
01:54:38,479 --> 01:54:42,638
the morning presentation someone said

2556
01:54:40,078 --> 01:54:45,319
that THC testing is happening a month

2557
01:54:42,639 --> 01:54:47,960
before Harvest I'm harvesting in April

2558
01:54:45,319 --> 01:54:49,519
does it mean I'm THC testing in March

2559
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:52,679
and I can actually grow High TC

2560
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:55,639
varieties in New York maybe that's Al a

2561
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:58,319
solution for hot varieties uh um and

2562
01:54:55,639 --> 01:55:01,440
when it comes to to the processing stage

2563
01:54:58,319 --> 01:55:03,399
you get the um the good fiber which goes

2564
01:55:01,439 --> 01:55:05,559
to spinning you got the her which

2565
01:55:03,399 --> 01:55:07,559
basically goes to any applications other

2566
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:10,000
than animal bedding because of the

2567
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:13,840
microbiological issues it has a funny

2568
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:16,920
smell it smells like um

2569
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:18,360
being in a village like you know the uh

2570
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:21,319
I don't know the English word for it but

2571
01:55:18,359 --> 01:55:23,598
it's basically you don't one of the

2572
01:55:21,319 --> 01:55:26,279
decorators I asked him about it and he

2573
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:28,199
said they did some trials and it doesn't

2574
01:55:26,279 --> 01:55:29,559
actually affect horses but it's not the

2575
01:55:28,198 --> 01:55:31,439
horses that are buying the herse it's

2576
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:34,360
the herse owners and they don't want

2577
01:55:31,439 --> 01:55:36,479
this smell so uh it's used mostly for

2578
01:55:34,359 --> 01:55:39,439
construction and for garden mching and

2579
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:41,598
the other the third part of of the

2580
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:43,078
product stream is is a dust we just use

2581
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:46,039
it for composting because we're not a

2582
01:55:43,078 --> 01:55:48,000
huge processor we rather aim to do all

2583
01:55:46,039 --> 01:55:49,920
the processing up until the very end

2584
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,710
stage rather than just go big and do one

2585
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:53,679
thing

2586
01:55:51,710 --> 01:55:55,359
[Music]

2587
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:57,480
do you have trouble with weed control

2588
01:55:55,359 --> 01:56:00,598
like uh when you go to baale is there a

2589
01:55:57,479 --> 01:56:02,479
lot of excess grass there is although

2590
01:56:00,599 --> 01:56:04,119
it's not really associated with winter

2591
01:56:02,479 --> 01:56:06,598
rating it's rather with the fact that

2592
01:56:04,118 --> 01:56:08,679
we're using EU certified ecological

2593
01:56:06,599 --> 01:56:11,480
regime which means we don't do anything

2594
01:56:08,679 --> 01:56:13,920
with any uh other than mechanical

2595
01:56:11,479 --> 01:56:17,078
destruction because we are sewing early

2596
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:18,920
May so we can allow the plants the weeds

2597
01:56:17,078 --> 01:56:20,599
to germinate kill them off allow them to

2598
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:23,520
germinate kill them off but there's

2599
01:56:20,599 --> 01:56:25,360
still plenty left and most of them die

2600
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:28,239
off before well all of them die off

2601
01:56:25,359 --> 01:56:29,960
before processing and the the uh the

2602
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:32,519
processing we're using is so

2603
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:34,719
mechanically aggressive that is actually

2604
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:37,480
reduces all of it to dust I have zero

2605
01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:39,639
problem with Wheats in the end product

2606
01:56:37,479 --> 01:56:41,879
two things that are important to mention

2607
01:56:39,639 --> 01:56:43,960
is like it takes some of my nutrients

2608
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:46,118
that's true and it takes some of my

2609
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:48,158
processing space if I introduce a ton

2610
01:56:46,118 --> 01:56:50,799
into the decorticator or the processing

2611
01:56:48,158 --> 01:56:53,000
line and 100 kgs of that is wheat well

2612
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:55,679
then I'm running essentially at 90 % of

2613
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,760
of the capacity which is a Nuance but

2614
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:59,679
not really a problem and one thing that

2615
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:02,440
I think Steve mentioned to me is like

2616
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:04,319
where you you just have um you're just

2617
01:57:02,439 --> 01:57:06,598
lucky with your weeds because some of

2618
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:07,799
the weeds that are growing in here are

2619
01:57:06,599 --> 01:57:09,920
actually going through all the

2620
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:11,440
processing lines so it it all depends on

2621
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:13,039
what sort of Wis are they I don't know

2622
01:57:11,439 --> 01:57:16,238
the the Polish name for my WIS so I

2623
01:57:13,039 --> 01:57:16,238
wouldn't even try to translate

2624
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:25,800
them great yeah very good

2625
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:27,639
[Applause]

2626
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:32,239
thank you very much and I think we all

2627
01:57:27,639 --> 01:57:32,239
have a goal of now coming to visit

2628
01:57:32,399 --> 01:57:39,359
Poland uh okay I just want to give you a

2629
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:42,520
couple of again anecdotal notes Here uh

2630
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:45,319
so this field to my left is carmena it's

2631
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:48,719
an international hemp variety I I really

2632
01:57:45,319 --> 01:57:51,599
like it uh this was planted May

2633
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:53,800
31st uh and you see that the grain heads

2634
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:54,960
are if they're not mature they're pretty

2635
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:57,880
close to

2636
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:59,960
mature uh very similar variety offered

2637
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:03,279
by Verve seeds is

2638
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:06,560
Jurassic uh performs very similar uh

2639
01:58:03,279 --> 01:58:11,599
ssba uh IH Williams will also perform

2640
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:13,679
like this I I like all three of those uh

2641
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:16,480
last year we had a grower

2642
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:19,199
nearby uh Harvest With a shellborne

2643
01:58:16,479 --> 01:58:20,319
Stripper header on his conventional John

2644
01:58:19,198 --> 01:58:23,839
Deere

2645
01:58:20,319 --> 01:58:26,000
Combine and most of that crop went

2646
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,520
through the stripper header quite

2647
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,078
well

2648
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:34,159
and we were left with a

2649
01:58:30,078 --> 01:58:38,319
field uh of standing stems with nothing

2650
01:58:34,158 --> 01:58:41,198
at the top and I can just imagine what

2651
01:58:38,319 --> 01:58:44,039
magic just described to us you could

2652
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:46,118
leave those stems to Winter W so you've

2653
01:58:44,039 --> 01:58:48,439
harvested the Grain and then you have a

2654
01:58:46,118 --> 01:58:50,839
field of standing stems with no foliage

2655
01:58:48,439 --> 01:58:53,519
and no grain head at the top that should

2656
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:56,760
winterr very well

2657
01:58:53,520 --> 01:59:00,119
uh so I'm going to point to Steve and my

2658
01:58:56,760 --> 01:59:02,039
other folks who are creative engineers

2659
01:59:00,118 --> 01:59:03,960
and I think what we need is a straw

2660
01:59:02,039 --> 01:59:06,840
Walker combine with a shellborne

2661
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:08,359
stripper header uh that's on an elevator

2662
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:10,880
that you can drive through that field

2663
01:59:08,359 --> 01:59:14,118
and run the the stripper header at 8 or

2664
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:17,159
9 or 10 ft tall capture the Grain and

2665
01:59:14,118 --> 01:59:20,479
then let's see uh what quality of straw

2666
01:59:17,158 --> 01:59:25,439
we get the next spring after we winter

2667
01:59:20,479 --> 01:59:25,439
Reddit okay that's my little anecdotal

2668
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:35,440
suggestion okay uh so normally we would

2669
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:38,840
have cut this field it would have been

2670
01:59:35,439 --> 01:59:42,279
laying there drying and starting to

2671
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:45,000
R but because our our fiber cut was

2672
01:59:42,279 --> 01:59:46,078
broken we didn't get a chance so we only

2673
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,439
cut it this

2674
01:59:46,078 --> 01:59:50,399
morning and we but we wanted to

2675
01:59:48,439 --> 01:59:53,559
demonstrate to you raking which would be

2676
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:58,238
the next step so as this dries and

2677
01:59:53,560 --> 02:00:00,719
starts to W it will R differentially so

2678
01:59:58,238 --> 02:00:04,198
it will dry and turn brown on the upper

2679
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:05,158
surface and then still be green on the

2680
02:00:04,198 --> 02:00:08,598
bottom

2681
02:00:05,158 --> 02:00:11,000
surface so we need to turn it at least

2682
02:00:08,599 --> 02:00:14,599
once and we also need to get it into

2683
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:18,719
wind rows so we are prepared to bail it

2684
02:00:14,599 --> 02:00:21,360
uh so we have uh a hay rake uh to do

2685
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:24,719
that normal hay rake uh we're going to

2686
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:28,799
demonstrate that uh and that's all just

2687
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:31,158
simple farming right that's what any hay

2688
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:33,199
farmer would do not

2689
02:00:31,158 --> 02:00:37,118
complicated The Twist that we're adding

2690
02:00:33,198 --> 02:00:39,359
today is uh as we grow this crop we want

2691
02:00:37,118 --> 02:00:42,319
to be a sustainable as possible and here

2692
02:00:39,359 --> 02:00:45,118
here at Corno agretech we want to be the

2693
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:49,158
farm of the future and we think the farm

2694
02:00:45,118 --> 02:00:52,399
of the future will be at least somewhat

2695
02:00:49,158 --> 02:00:55,399
electrified uh so we have one of the

2696
02:00:52,399 --> 02:00:57,839
first examples of an electric tractor

2697
02:00:55,399 --> 02:01:00,359
that's on the market uh that we

2698
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:05,599
purchased uh and we have Rich Wildman

2699
02:01:00,359 --> 02:01:08,000
from agdo who is now our regional

2700
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:10,520
distributor that's correct yes Regional

2701
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:12,679
distributor for Monarch tractor and I'm

2702
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:15,760
going to call up uh Cody light from

2703
02:01:12,679 --> 02:01:18,560
Monarch tractor uh to describe their

2704
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:21,840
technology and uh then we're going to

2705
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:21,840
see it run

2706
02:01:22,319 --> 02:01:27,158
I'll just I'll just start but then turn

2707
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:32,679
this over to Cody um we're based in

2708
02:01:27,158 --> 02:01:38,039
Rochester um this is a 100% EV no diesel

2709
02:01:32,679 --> 02:01:41,078
no no fuel um rechargeable tractor it

2710
02:01:38,039 --> 02:01:43,118
also has the ability to operate

2711
02:01:41,078 --> 02:01:46,719
autonomously um we'll show you that

2712
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:48,759
later on um Cody why don't you tell them

2713
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:52,480
just very briefly the background of

2714
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:54,400
Monarch and um so my name is light I'm

2715
02:01:52,479 --> 02:01:57,000
the regional sales manager for Monarch

2716
02:01:54,399 --> 02:02:00,559
here in the Northeast um representing

2717
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:02,960
with with act too but this tractor is is

2718
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:04,679
really started in 2017 and the

2719
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:06,880
co-founders there's five co-founders of

2720
02:02:04,679 --> 02:02:08,920
Monarch that had the same vision that

2721
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:11,719
Larry just just stated the

2722
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:13,359
sustainability cleaning um being more

2723
02:02:11,719 --> 02:02:16,399
environmental friendly but then taking

2724
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:18,559
it to another level of every Farm has

2725
02:02:16,399 --> 02:02:20,879
labor shortages so the future of Monarch

2726
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:22,679
is also in the autonomy piece which I

2727
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:25,960
believe that you guys will see an

2728
02:02:22,679 --> 02:02:28,319
example of that during lunch um but the

2729
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:30,679
the core belief of the tractor is to be

2730
02:02:28,319 --> 02:02:33,559
fully electric and to give you that that

2731
02:02:30,679 --> 02:02:36,118
labor enhancing down down the road we're

2732
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:38,119
going to have Chris drive it today but

2733
02:02:36,118 --> 02:02:39,880
while while he's driving it the the

2734
02:02:38,118 --> 02:02:41,479
sustainability piece kind of goes into

2735
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:44,159
how the tractor is designed too the

2736
02:02:41,479 --> 02:02:47,519
original intent was to take a utility

2737
02:02:44,158 --> 02:02:49,799
vehicle and a tractor that came from a

2738
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:51,159
Vineyard and kind of combine it into one

2739
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:53,000
so if you look at the tractor the front

2740
02:02:51,158 --> 02:02:54,479
of it looks kind of goofy right the

2741
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:57,000
front of it is I like to call it the

2742
02:02:54,479 --> 02:03:00,039
front so we give you a bed that can hold

2743
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,479
up to 220 lb and we give you d-rings in

2744
02:03:00,039 --> 02:03:03,238
there to be able to strap things down

2745
02:03:01,479 --> 02:03:06,078
and use it as a bed like you would a

2746
02:03:03,238 --> 02:03:07,638
pickup truck or your utility vehicle um

2747
02:03:06,078 --> 02:03:09,039
the color of it though at the top that

2748
02:03:07,639 --> 02:03:12,800
kind of sandstone is supposed to

2749
02:03:09,039 --> 02:03:15,639
represent sand dirt the blue the blue

2750
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:20,480
part is the battery that battery is

2751
02:03:15,639 --> 02:03:22,520
0 Kow 440 volts and that that color is

2752
02:03:20,479 --> 02:03:25,319
supposed to represent w

2753
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:27,840
the dark gray is supposed to represent

2754
02:03:25,319 --> 02:03:29,359
Rock so we take the sustainability piece

2755
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:32,360
all the way down to the color of that

2756
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:32,359
tractor

2757
02:03:32,489 --> 02:03:39,698
[Music]

2758
02:04:03,279 --> 02:04:06,198
[Music]

2759
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:08,719
through a mobile app on our phone I'll

2760
02:04:06,198 --> 02:04:11,359
be able to see that I can see the video

2761
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:12,880
cameras live from anywhere in the world

2762
02:04:11,359 --> 02:04:14,920
I can see how fast the operator is

2763
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:17,078
moving you know if they hit something

2764
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:19,239
and no one tells you about it well I I

2765
02:04:17,078 --> 02:04:22,238
got proof now of what really happened

2766
02:04:19,238 --> 02:04:24,799
right um so there's a lot of opportun

2767
02:04:22,238 --> 02:04:28,759
within this tractor I guess I'll just

2768
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:28,760
I'll leave it there is there any

2769
02:04:37,479 --> 02:04:42,039
questions great so he asked about weight

2770
02:04:39,719 --> 02:04:46,279
compared to a comparable diesel tractor

2771
02:04:42,039 --> 02:04:48,559
warranty and runtime and I'll throw off

2772
02:04:46,279 --> 02:04:52,198
warranty so the tractor weighs about

2773
02:04:48,559 --> 02:04:54,279
5700 lbs so comparable to a

2774
02:04:52,198 --> 02:04:57,439
similar horsepower tractor we rate this

2775
02:04:54,279 --> 02:05:01,198
tractor at 70 motor horsepower 40 on the

2776
02:04:57,439 --> 02:05:03,839
PTO um it it is heavy but when we look

2777
02:05:01,198 --> 02:05:06,238
at that battery so that blue part up

2778
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:08,639
front if we were to weigh that compared

2779
02:05:06,238 --> 02:05:10,479
to a diesel engine with all of its

2780
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:14,639
emissions and cooling we weigh about the

2781
02:05:10,479 --> 02:05:17,359
same our tractors weighed 5050 a typical

2782
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:19,960
tractor 6040 so we we put that weight

2783
02:05:17,359 --> 02:05:21,439
across the tractor more evenly than than

2784
02:05:19,960 --> 02:05:25,158
some of the others in in the industry

2785
02:05:21,439 --> 02:05:26,919
run time is up to 14 hours so that's on

2786
02:05:25,158 --> 02:05:29,000
a single charge we offer three different

2787
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:31,840
Chargers we can charge that as quick as

2788
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:33,800
5 hours up to you know 10 hours

2789
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:37,319
overnight to be fully charged ready for

2790
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:40,880
the next day and then the warranty piece

2791
02:05:37,319 --> 02:05:44,118
the tractor itself is a 4year 4,000 hour

2792
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:46,159
warranty the battery is an 8year 8,000

2793
02:05:44,118 --> 02:05:49,118
hour warranty so when you look at

2794
02:05:46,158 --> 02:05:50,759
longevity warranty what the company's

2795
02:05:49,118 --> 02:05:52,319
going to stay behind nothing in the

2796
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:56,039
industry today

2797
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:59,198
gas diesel electric touches this

2798
02:05:56,039 --> 02:06:02,760
warrant how does run imp on

2799
02:05:59,198 --> 02:06:08,439
the great question it definitely affects

2800
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:08,440
it um PTO takes a lot of horsepower

2801
02:06:34,279 --> 02:06:39,840
and our last demonstration is of that

2802
02:06:36,439 --> 02:06:42,479
male Baylor would you see up on the

2803
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:45,199
hill well as you can tell not everything

2804
02:06:42,479 --> 02:06:47,279
goes to plan uh I got a very small

2805
02:06:45,198 --> 02:06:48,799
partial bail but if you look over here

2806
02:06:47,279 --> 02:06:52,599
you can see I just really jammed that

2807
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:54,039
right side uh it's a jam I've not before

2808
02:06:52,599 --> 02:06:56,920
uh so this is new to me I'm going to

2809
02:06:54,039 --> 02:06:59,559
have to take some time to clear that out

2810
02:06:56,920 --> 02:07:01,158
um but you can see it only takes half a

2811
02:06:59,559 --> 02:07:03,920
second before you run into a problem

2812
02:07:01,158 --> 02:07:06,759
that might take you an afternoon to fix

2813
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:09,440
um so it takes a lot of vigilance when

2814
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:12,520
you're running this equipment only takes

2815
02:07:09,439 --> 02:07:13,799
6 in for 2 seconds too long and you got

2816
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:16,440
a problem

2817
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:18,880
so like like what everything we're doing

2818
02:07:16,439 --> 02:07:20,359
out here this is research we're learning

2819
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:22,760
and we're going to continue to develop

2820
02:07:20,359 --> 02:07:25,000
our knowledge um I'll as an equipment

2821
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:27,079
operator I'll continue to learn and

2822
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:29,000
encounter this less and less but I can

2823
02:07:27,078 --> 02:07:32,519
assure you I will encounter this more

2824
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:34,118
times in the future um so that's that's

2825
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:37,119
what we're all here to do today is is

2826
02:07:34,118 --> 02:07:39,039
learn and now you can see some of the

2827
02:07:37,118 --> 02:07:42,880
things I deal with which can be

2828
02:07:39,039 --> 02:07:45,198
immediate problems um a little bit

2829
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:47,840
more well you got to have tenacity if

2830
02:07:45,198 --> 02:07:49,279
you're going to give oh absolutely I

2831
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:51,880
don't have many skills but I got

2832
02:07:49,279 --> 02:07:53,920
persistence

2833
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:57,520
TV products but they're not a priority

2834
02:07:53,920 --> 02:08:01,158
for us um it's actually more ourv have

2835
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:01,159
market and our

2836
02:08:26,609 --> 02:08:32,839

2837
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:37,989
[Music]

2838
02:08:46,479 --> 02:08:50,399
and that's how you make a boun

2839
02:08:50,939 --> 02:08:54,059
[Applause]

2840
02:08:58,279 --> 02:09:03,800
smell yeah it has a yeah of a mulchy

2841
02:09:01,639 --> 02:09:07,118
smell to

2842
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:07,119
it now

2843
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:13,520
this this has been a production of
