1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,339
University

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:13,009
welcome everybody today it's a real

4
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:14,958
pleasure to be back here I haven't been

5
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,910
back to Cornell in a few years even

6
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:18,739
though New York City's not really that

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,230
far away so thank you so much for

8
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:23,598
inviting me here to talk about the

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,489
sustainable sites initiative which is a

10
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,730
project that I've been involved with now

11
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:30,410
for almost eight years and it's a

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,750
project that I got started with my

13
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:36,409
involvement with through Cornell through

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:38,439
working with dr. Nina basak and the

15
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:42,739
sustainable sites team to develop

16
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:46,969
sustainable protocols for landscapes and

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:50,420
so today I'm going to discuss what the

18
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:52,100
guidelines are all about and go through

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,289
some of the principles behind the

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,270
guidelines I'm going to discuss the

21
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:59,060
process through which we've come through

22
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,310
in about the last 10 years total to get

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,469
to where we are today with the guideline

24
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,960
and rating system then i'm going to give

25
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:08,359
some examples of credits that probably

26
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:10,639
relate to some of the work you may be

27
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,269
doing relating to vegetation and soil

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,769
specifically even though the system is

29
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:17,089
involves much more than just that but

30
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:19,689
i'll focus a little bit on that today

31
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,670
and then i'll also give some site

32
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:25,429
specific examples of projects that were

33
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,890
involved in the pilot or testing process

34
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,530
for the system within the last few years

35
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,239
and then also i'll go into what's next

36
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,239
since there's more to come from this

37
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,759
project so as i mentioned i first got

38
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:39,319
involved with this project as a as a

39
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,868
graduate student and i was lucky enough

40
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:44,169
to get hired on to be a research

41
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:46,728
assistant specifically in the vegetation

42
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,170
subcommittees and with a little bit of

43
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:49,459
work also in the human health and

44
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,460
well-being and even the soil

45
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:54,769
subcommittees also Fred cow it and I

46
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:56,929
don't know if Fred's here today did a

47
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:59,959
lot of work on this project over the

48
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,630
years in the soil sections

49
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,908
believe is also a reviewer in many of

50
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:06,890
the pilot studies for this project so

51
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,469
anybody who has more questions about

52
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,060
sustainable sites after I've gone and

53
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:13,099
especially about soil I would recommend

54
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,140
you talk to Fred and then also Nina

55
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,519
Basak as well who unfortunately couldn't

56
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:20,479
be here today because she's at an oak

57
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,069
conference so so sustainable sites is

58
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,049
essentially a set of guidelines in a

59
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:26,030
voluntary rating system for sustainable

60
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,000
landscape design construction and

61
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,890
maintenance and this came out of the

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,379
growth of green building which over the

63
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:35,169
past decade and a half has had

64
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:38,319
tremendous impact on that construction

65
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:41,780
design and then facilities maintenance

66
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,719
professions overall not just throughout

67
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,969
America but globally and so this is the

68
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,419
very first LEED Platinum building in in

69
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:53,719
America and so it was really forward

70
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:55,669
thinking at the time but one of the

71
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:57,650
troubling things was that when you

72
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:00,669
looked at landscapes and early versions

73
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:05,079
of lead there was a paltry amount of

74
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:07,458
direction and really not a lot of great

75
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:09,260
critical thinking involving what

76
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,969
sustainable landscapes really meant in

77
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:14,479
relation to the building side of things

78
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:16,219
and so you know even though we know that

79
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,560
buildings are really important and how

80
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:20,269
we direct our resources in how we

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,090
construct them and manage them it's

82
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:25,370
really important there's a lot more than

83
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,719
just that in the world there's a lot

84
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,980
more than just buildings thank goodness

85
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:33,409
so the the team on sites came together

86
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:35,840
and essentially the team that first came

87
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:38,199
together to discuss some of the other

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,989
issues with sustainable development

89
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:44,328
which include you know pesticide use you

90
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:47,930
know water usage invasive species

91
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:51,170
problems combined sewer overflow issues

92
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,090
and how we manage our stormwater urban

93
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:55,879
heat island affects climate change

94
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,469
erosion problems these were all issues

95
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,389
that we didn't think we're being very

96
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:01,609
well managed through the lead or the US

97
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:05,629
Green Building Council sustainability

98
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:07,340
criteria so with that the Lady Bird

99
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:09,379
Johnson Wildflower Center through

100
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,060
University of Texas at Austin the US

101
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:13,280
Green Building Council and the American

102
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,750
Society of landscape architects all came

103
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,149
together and sort of all simultaneously

104
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,620
had the same idea that they really

105
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,620
needed to about to develop a rating

106
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,209
system that partnered with lead or US

107
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,120
Green Building Council guidelines and

108
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:29,000
helped to get those a little more on

109
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,100
track with the best scientific knowledge

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,480
that they could put together and the

111
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,970
best team that they could put together

112
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,379
to try to move forward with a

113
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:43,610
comprehensive set of ratings and a

114
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:45,379
system to help put a better spin on what

115
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,199
sustainable design meant in terms of

116
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:51,050
landscapes so with that the goals of

117
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,120
sites have been and continue to be to

118
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,910
create regenerative systems into foster

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,649
resiliency to ensure future resource

120
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,660
supply and demitted gate climate change

121
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:01,279
to enhance human wellbeing and

122
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,800
strengthen community so there's

123
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,199
community components to this as well to

124
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,460
also transform the market through design

125
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,370
development and maintenance practices

126
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:12,620
and so I'm involved a lot in capital

127
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,980
projects in my current role and I've

128
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,209
seen over the past several years how

129
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,370
sustainable development guidelines such

130
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:21,589
as lead have really transformed the

131
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,189
industry and so what was once really

132
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:27,319
difficult to conceive of has over time

133
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:29,899
through the work of these types of

134
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,329
rating systems driven it to become more

135
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:34,310
of an industry standards so well the

136
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:36,349
green building side of things is really

137
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,600
well on its way with lead and some other

138
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,700
sustainability systems like that the

139
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,379
landscape side is still a little bit

140
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:45,259
nascent as far as how we're going to

141
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:49,750
follow up with industry standards and to

142
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:49,750
generate that further so

143
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,920
ok so the principles behind sustainable

144
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,110
sites are based on ecosystem services

145
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,390
which are benefits that people obtain

146
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,550
from ecosystems that support our lives

147
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,469
but are unfortunately often considered

148
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,020
free and are not often part of

149
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,690
traditional accounting methods so this

150
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:13,449
whole system is underpinned by bringing

151
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:16,420
forward of some of these things that we

152
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:18,370
haven't always thought of as formerly

153
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,620
and as far as cost benefits are

154
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,269
concerned and so these are just a few of

155
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,310
the ecosystem services that were

156
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:29,019
actually considered in the development

157
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:30,399
of the entire rating system and we're

158
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:33,519
going forward and trying to build

159
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,469
systems that are a lot more thoughtful

160
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,180
and so this could be the results when

161
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:41,710
you it's just an example of a successful

162
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,350
credential pilot project that's been

163
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:45,669
certified recently and so you can see

164
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,350
there's quite a difference between that

165
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,850
original LEED Platinum building that I

166
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,510
showed where there was like a couple of

167
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:55,260
token trees in the front braces versus a

168
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:57,730
much more sophisticated landscape that

169
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,939
takes into account a lot of the other

170
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:03,939
ecosystem services that were not here to

171
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:06,129
for really thought of formally so some

172
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:08,050
of the other principles behind sites

173
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:10,589
include the fact that we believe that

174
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,350
almost any type of landscape could be

175
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:18,459
developed in this manner so the testing

176
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:20,260
has been very thoughtfully positioned so

177
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:22,149
that even if you have a really small

178
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,649
site you should be able to do this

179
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:25,899
whether you have a really hyper urban

180
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:28,239
site you should also be able to take the

181
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:31,539
system and apply the principles or if

182
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,480
you have a pristine green site that's

183
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,340
you know maybe even high quality natural

184
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,980
areas that you should also be able to

185
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:41,679
apply these principles there too and so

186
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,450
also with the idea that ecosystem

187
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,870
services can be derived with any

188
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:49,899
landscape theory so the timeline of

189
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:52,930
sites goes way back to 2005 so 10 years

190
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:55,469
now and so through time we've gone

191
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,689
through research and development of

192
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,640
developing standards and guidelines and

193
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:02,040
then performance benchmarks were in

194
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,329
which were in draft form in

195
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,790
2008-2009 which is what I was involved

196
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:09,459
with early on and helping to create and

197
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:12,640
edit some of those then they ran a pilot

198
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:14,529
program between 2010 and 2012 and I also

199
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,979
was involved with a pilot project in

200
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:20,439
Canada when in my formal role at Humber

201
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,689
Arboretum in Toronto and so I've got

202
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:23,769
pilot program experience as well and I

203
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:28,029
can tell you a little bit more about

204
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:30,159
that later then also beyond that they've

205
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:32,500
been working with all the data that's

206
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,360
come through the pilot project and been

207
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,340
refining it since there were obviously

208
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,879
lots of criticisms and lots of

209
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,889
challenges that we were able to look at

210
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:44,740
from the pilot process that were then

211
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:46,360
taken went back through and then tried

212
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,830
to clean up the process to make it

213
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:54,399
easier more accessible and hopefully

214
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:57,670
less expensive also to to manage and so

215
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,250
now the latest rendition of sustainable

216
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:02,709
sites is actually in v2 and I have a

217
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,259
copy of the guidelines here so it's

218
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,450
quite large but you can get this online

219
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:09,939
if you'd like and so this is the latest

220
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:14,140
version of the guidelines and rating

221
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:17,500
systems and what's great is just this

222
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:19,600
past June it's been formally announced

223
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,820
that the US Green Building Council and

224
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,250
GBC I which is the credentialing and

225
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,900
accreditation body for lead is formally

226
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,000
taking the system on so it's now

227
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,949
officially part of the lead suite of

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,110
systems and this is the first time ever

229
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,230
that the US Green Building Council has

230
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,240
adopted a program that they didn't

231
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,580
specifically develop themselves so it's

232
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,190
quite an achievement and the system has

233
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,320
been I guess designed to mesh from the

234
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,090
very GetGo but it's taken quite a lot of

235
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,060
work to get that to come to fruition and

236
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:51,670
so finally you can become you can have a

237
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:54,759
site that's accredited officially and

238
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:56,469
will be credentialed through GBC I so

239
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,809
with the three reports that have been

240
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,509
released today this was the first one

241
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:04,259
that you can look this up and see how

242
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:07,600
everything was based initially then

243
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:09,850
there's also been some great support

244
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,830
through the US government and so an

245
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,720
example of the way that this

246
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,320
particular system is influencing not

247
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,970
just industry standards but also in

248
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,950
influencing government policy is that

249
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,649
the US government's been adopting the

250
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,440
guidelines also for their own sites

251
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:29,959
since the government owns quite a lot of

252
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,550
acreage throughout the country so it can

253
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,650
be very influential just to have a

254
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:35,059
government agree that these are their de

255
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:36,470
facto guidelines that they're going to

256
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:41,179
use going forward so that's actually

257
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:43,639
happening and so beyond that I'll

258
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:46,399
explain the sites program goals for the

259
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,649
pilot program because it's been it's

260
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,240
been very interesting to see a lot of

261
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:53,480
different kinds of sites go through the

262
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,789
pilot process and get we were able to

263
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,409
derive a lot of great information to

264
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:59,870
refine the process through the pilot

265
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:01,549
programs so we really were looking to

266
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,080
gain feedback and revise the credits

267
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:06,649
from the get-go since we knew that this

268
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:09,200
is quite a complex system and so we've

269
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:11,090
been always knowing that it's not going

270
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,330
to be really ever finished for quite

271
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:16,370
some time so the pilot program started

272
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:19,400
in 2010 and these are the kinds of

273
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:21,259
projects that project types so there was

274
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,169
a good diversity deliberately in the

275
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:26,990
pilot project celeste selection process

276
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:28,849
between types of spaces so it ranges

277
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,279
between open space and institutional

278
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,950
commercial residential government

279
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,799
project sizes also tried to have a

280
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,629
diversity of really small sites and even

281
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,549
very large sites so some of the sites

282
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:42,740
that were in the pilot project were well

283
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:45,319
over 500 acres which is quite large and

284
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:50,779
then also a different mix of existing

285
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:52,520
uses so the way we define oh yeah okay

286
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:54,199
so the way we define what sorry I want

287
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,079
to go back here gray field greenfield

288
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,820
and brownfield grey field is a

289
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,870
previously developed site but not one

290
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:05,120
that is completely toxic green field is

291
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:08,330
something that's not really been that

292
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,740
affected by development so a natural

293
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,379
area might be considered a green field

294
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,538
but a park depending on the

295
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,129
original usage could be as well and then

296
00:12:13,538 --> 00:12:17,348
there's brown fields which are seriously

297
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:20,168
toxic sites which actually need some

298
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:22,209
sort of remediation even extra thought

299
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:25,239
and process to be able to make use of

300
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:29,048
them and to get them to be regenerative

301
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:31,119
again so there's 47 sites to date that

302
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:33,038
were certified by the pilot projects and

303
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:36,759
the pilot project process is now closed

304
00:12:33,038 --> 00:12:39,698
and so there were originally I think

305
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:42,099
maybe close to 200 sites that applied to

306
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:44,438
be pilot projects and so these were the

307
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:46,269
sites that across the country actually

308
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:49,088
finished the process and actually got

309
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:50,979
certification so I mentioned that I was

310
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:53,289
involved with a pilot project in Canada

311
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:55,899
and we did not achieve certification and

312
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:58,028
so it is as much telling what sights did

313
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:01,869
not achieve certification as it is which

314
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:04,509
ones did and so though I was sad that we

315
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:06,639
didn't achieve certification one of the

316
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:08,499
challenges that we had and one thing

317
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,509
that I deliberately went into with my

318
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:13,319
eyes wide open is that I was trying to

319
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:16,658
certify a site that had been completed

320
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:18,668
primarily over five years before so the

321
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:20,229
message that I got and that went back to

322
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:22,629
the site's team was that you should not

323
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:24,119
really try to be cribbed getting

324
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:26,829
certified for this particular

325
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:28,959
sustainable sites of certification

326
00:13:26,828 --> 00:13:31,568
process unless you've got a very new

327
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,728
project coming online and you're able to

328
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:36,158
start the process for sustainable sites

329
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,449
in early in the concept stage so I was

330
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:39,009
trying to do it on the back end and I

331
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:42,578
really couldn't get all the data

332
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:44,350
together in order to do that from what

333
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:47,108
the site looked like prior to the

334
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,459
project so those were words of caution

335
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:49,869
that I had to bring back to the site's

336
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:52,388
team and they took that and I think now

337
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:54,100
they know that now so that's just one

338
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:55,538
example of how you know you might fail

339
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,069
if you're doing a pilot project and

340
00:13:55,538 --> 00:14:00,068
that's okay too we went pretty far down

341
00:13:57,068 --> 00:14:02,738
the process so so as I mentioned we got

342
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:05,198
47 sites certified and a very good mix

343
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:08,439
of different project types and that was

344
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:12,188
absolutely deliberate and so got great

345
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:15,009
data from that but what was really an

346
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:16,568
early-stage criticism of the sustainable

347
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:17,918
sites initiative was whether or not you

348
00:14:16,568 --> 00:14:20,349
could do it for a really really small

349
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:21,399
site and we did have some some sites

350
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,860
that were able to prove that

351
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,439
yes you can do this and for instance you

352
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,300
could actually apply these principles to

353
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,130
a backyard landscape like a urban

354
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:33,189
postage stamp landscape and still do

355
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:35,139
that if you'd like but it is a little

356
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:43,330
bit easier perhaps if you have a larger

357
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:44,740
scale to work with it is and I was going

358
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,960
to talk about that at the end as an

359
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,610
example so yes there is a pilot project

360
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,620
site here that did achieve certification

361
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:53,560
and it is the entry gardens to man

362
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,799
library so I yes and I have some good

363
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,959
some good stats on that too so

364
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:01,240
interesting also to look at what pilot

365
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,759
projects how they were able to go

366
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,350
through and what level of certification

367
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:08,289
so at the time of the pilot projects we

368
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,580
had a star system so the more stars you

369
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:11,469
got the higher the level of

370
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,500
certification so four stars would be

371
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,420
equivalent to flatland platinum and one

372
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,629
star would be equivalent ty guess is it

373
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:22,000
bronze or gets Bronze Silver Gold and

374
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:23,740
Platinum I think for lead so these were

375
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,750
the approximate equivalencies but you

376
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,789
can see here that the vast majority of

377
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,320
the projects went for the one star

378
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:32,469
certification which is a little bit

379
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,750
easier to do the hardest obviously the

380
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:38,290
four stars and I believe that was the

381
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,669
Phipps conservatory in Pittsburgh and so

382
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:42,309
anybody who's gone to the Phipps

383
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:44,049
conservatory can check out that site

384
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:46,179
they are tremendous in their leadership

385
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:48,729
in sustainability and in fact they were

386
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:51,789
able to get certified triple

387
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,700
certification in LEED Platinum for their

388
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:56,110
building Living Building Challenge

389
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,900
certification with all or nothing and

390
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,700
then level of certification for

391
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,399
sustainable sites so they are really an

392
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,670
exemplary an exemplary project to look

393
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:08,230
at so now we've got the sites version 2

394
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:10,019
rating system and then we also have

395
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:13,570
reference guide so these are available

396
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:16,750
online and so within the new rating

397
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:20,020
system there is a division in different

398
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:23,379
guidelines and credits that follow in

399
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:25,120
line basically following the general

400
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:28,090
design process that when you're going

401
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,620
through a new project if you you've got

402
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,230
your landscape architect your design

403
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,299
team your

404
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:36,409
Engineers in place and your contractors

405
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:39,500
hired it takes it from pre design site

406
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:41,719
and concept through to planning

407
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,980
different aspects from water management

408
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,170
soil vegetation of your materials usage

409
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:51,379
your your reuse of materials hopefully

410
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:53,000
as well then also guides each your human

411
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:56,330
health and well-being and how to plan

412
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,629
for your community or just general usage

413
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:01,790
of the site to optimal effect then going

414
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:03,950
into construction and then operations

415
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:06,379
and maintenance guidelines since we all

416
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,750
know that a project doesn't end when the

417
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,740
construction is over we also have to

418
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:14,420
operate and keep our sites working

419
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,779
functionally and so that's an extra

420
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,340
challenge even beyond what was normally

421
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:22,460
taken into account with the buildings

422
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,649
because all of this entails stewarding

423
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:28,730
functional living landscapes so a

424
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:30,500
building can theoretically be a little

425
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,910
bit more stagnant than a landscape pen

426
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,740
but a landscape was always going to be

427
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:37,190
changing and it's always going to

428
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,589
hopefully be growing in some way as well

429
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,330
so managing that over time is actually

430
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:43,579
much more challenging I would argue them

431
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:45,679
then opening a building and maintaining

432
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:47,269
a building although I manage facilities

433
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,009
and horticulture in my current job so I

434
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:50,509
know too that buildings break down and

435
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:53,180
they're difficult to do as well so I

436
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:54,890
don't want to I don't want to say that

437
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,900
it's not easy that's not hard for both

438
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,730
things but I think managing landscapes

439
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,650
and thinking about this long term is

440
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,049
even much more difficult for for these

441
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,630
kinds of systems and then beyond that

442
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:09,769
there's also credits and guidelines for

443
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:11,390
how to go forth with extra extra work

444
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:14,119
that you can do for education and

445
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:16,520
monitoring the performance over time of

446
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,809
these landscapes and then even extra

447
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,569
innovation and exemplary performance

448
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:22,849
credit since these projects have been

449
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:24,409
tremendous in coming back with to us

450
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:25,519
with all sorts of really innovative

451
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,400
things that we had never thought of

452
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,950
before so always looking to steward that

453
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,480
so there's a scorecard that looks kind

454
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,680
of similar to what you might find if you

455
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,509
run through a lead project and

456
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,519
this is what it looks like I'm not you

457
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:41,160
can look at this online it's a lot of

458
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,389
small print but you get the picture you

459
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,220
can kind of do your little checklist

460
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,460
ahead of time and then through the

461
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,380
process and see how you're scoring so

462
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,960
it's also interesting to look at the

463
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,760
kinds of professionals who have been

464
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,650
reporting to us that they're most

465
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,509
interested in this project and so

466
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,720
obviously you can see that landscape

467
00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:02,579
architects have been the majority

468
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,740
interest in this project and that's

469
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:05,849
that's reflective obviously is the fact

470
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,569
that they're the ones who really

471
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:11,730
involved with with the I guess design

472
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:13,470
and construction process and a lot of

473
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,890
these projects but there's a lot of

474
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:20,089
other professions that fish so be

475
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:22,590
affecting and hopefully stewarding new

476
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:25,500
professional I guess interest in

477
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:27,359
sustainability and so I know I'm a

478
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,460
horticulturist by training and I found

479
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,119
working through this process to be

480
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,160
invaluable and I think because of it I'm

481
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,989
hopefully a better partner in the

482
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,720
construction process when I get involved

483
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,819
with that and so I think there there's a

484
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,420
lot to be learned for a whole slew of

485
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:47,369
different professions here so the system

486
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,320
is based on a 200 point scale at this

487
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:52,109
point and it recognizes percentage of

488
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:55,470
attainment there's actually a teen

489
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:57,569
prerequisites so those are not just

490
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,900
credits those are things that you

491
00:19:57,569 --> 00:20:03,029
absolutely must do in order to be a part

492
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,519
of the system and so I'll explain a few

493
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:08,129
of those going forward but beyond the 18

494
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:11,190
prerequisites there's also many points

495
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,770
and then some of the points are awarded

496
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:16,380
for different credits based on level of

497
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:18,240
attainment as well and so there's now

498
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,130
four levels of attainment that are well

499
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,720
approximate now the lead system so now

500
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,450
we're going more into the platinum and

501
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,160
the gold certification I believe in

502
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,490
order to make it mesh better with the

503
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,790
lead system so alleble eligible projects

504
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,690
could be a new construction that may gee

505
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:35,878
maybe

506
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,100
major renovations as well but this is

507
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:41,699
really a system designed for brand new

508
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:43,439
projects and as I mentioned it's really

509
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,048
difficult to try to do it after the fact

510
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,389
so I don't recommend it myself there's

511
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:51,319
no maximum size but there is a minimum

512
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:55,258
of two thousand square feet in order to

513
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:58,589
to be involved and we're open to all

514
00:20:55,259 --> 00:21:00,329
projects types with sites with buildings

515
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:03,589
are without so that was the other

516
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:06,148
interesting comparison to lead early on

517
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:07,648
if you didn't have a building on your

518
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:10,349
site you couldn't get LEED certification

519
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:12,719
and so you know what there's a lot more

520
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:14,369
than just buildings so we felt it was

521
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,990
important that you didn't have to hang

522
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:18,089
your hat on a building in order to be

523
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,519
considered a sustainable site and then

524
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:23,158
this is also open globally as well so

525
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:26,609
there were some initial pilot projects

526
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:29,159
that applied to be a part of the the

527
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:30,719
testing process and including my own

528
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,820
which was in canada and i think if you

529
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,679
and australia so i'm not sure if any of

530
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:36,928
those actually finished i think there

531
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:40,288
was a few extra challenges that comes

532
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:42,149
from trying to work on this project from

533
00:21:40,288 --> 00:21:43,230
outside the country but that's something

534
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:44,758
i know they're going to be working on

535
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,798
and the Green Building Council has the

536
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:49,889
capacity to bring it forward and to a

537
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:53,339
global scale so the principles behind

538
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:55,888
the process involve an examination of

539
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:58,470
your waste hierarchy and so ultimately

540
00:21:55,888 --> 00:22:00,119
we try to prevent waste if we can't do

541
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,579
that we reduce it then if we can't do

542
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:05,189
that we just reuse and then recycle and

543
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:06,808
then the ultimate worst thing that we

544
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:10,259
can do is really to have things that are

545
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:11,638
disposed so we try to avoid that so we

546
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:13,798
try to stay to the top of the waste

547
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:16,048
hierarchy with the system credits and

548
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:18,269
then we're also trying to instill a

549
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:21,329
paradigm shift from not just

550
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:24,720
conservation but regeneration so I'll

551
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:27,329
show some examples of projects that were

552
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,879
went beyond just conserving high-value

553
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:32,759
landscapes but also took pretty

554
00:22:29,878 --> 00:22:34,659
dysfunctional landscapes and then made

555
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:39,440
them into regenerative

556
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:41,540
so this this graphic shows further the

557
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,240
the difference between conservation and

558
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:49,399
then bringing it over to regeneration so

559
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,890
if you have a well-performing landscape

560
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,720
you could in theory conserve what you

561
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,790
have and just get really good tree

562
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,380
protection or protect that site you know

563
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:59,029
putting a fence around it is just an

564
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,549
example of that and then you're going to

565
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:03,168
come out you know okay just conservation

566
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:05,629
is very important and we're trying to

567
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:07,400
Stewart that in the process or you could

568
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,870
manage a little bit better what you've

569
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,570
got if you're not doing such a good job

570
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:13,428
of that restoration you know if you cut

571
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:15,619
your tree down maybe you can try to

572
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:17,690
restore the landscape and then get it

573
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:19,250
back up to a functional level and then

574
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,990
of course there's lots of sites that

575
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,720
we're working with that are toxic

576
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,759
there's like hardly any life in them

577
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,970
right now and the existing conditions

578
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,950
are deplorable so sites are really

579
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,860
encouraged to take on those kinds of

580
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:36,048
challenges in the process and to develop

581
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:37,729
a project that's going to create future

582
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:39,740
site conditions that are that are much

583
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:43,519
much better and have regenerative and

584
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,990
functional landscapes in the future so i

585
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,359
said i was going to focus a little bit

586
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,640
on soil and vegetation credit since i

587
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:53,089
think that probably best applies to most

588
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:55,460
of this this group here and so a lot of

589
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:58,159
the credits you can see listed here of

590
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:01,480
pertain to that there's four at the top

591
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:04,308
that are actually required and so that's

592
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,429
what i mentioned before the prerequisite

593
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:09,319
so you can see here that you have no you

594
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:11,720
have no recourse but to create and

595
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:13,519
communicate a soil management plan we

596
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,130
must see that in order for you to be

597
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,109
considered part of the system for

598
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,940
sustainable sites you have to agree to

599
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:22,189
control and manage your invasive species

600
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,558
and you have to use appropriate plans

601
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,929
and so it's interesting how we define

602
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,730
all this but we've debated a lot over

603
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:30,259
that but everybody on the team felt that

604
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,298
it was imperative that we at least start

605
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:35,329
with that as a baseline and so the rest

606
00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:37,160
of the credits are actually optional and

607
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:38,480
so there's different levels of points

608
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,230
that you can get depending on

609
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,240
how you can go through the process so

610
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,860
some examples include controlling and

611
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,870
manage invasive plants as I mentioned we

612
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:50,240
just thought this is not even an option

613
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:52,849
and so you can see here I think this is

614
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,669
kudzu so we just don't even want to talk

615
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:57,829
about why anymore it's like just do it

616
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:59,540
just control and manage and deal with

617
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,339
invasive species if you're developing a

618
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,859
new site and don't add new invasive

619
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:05,119
species into your project either so

620
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:06,829
that's also something that's very

621
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:11,209
important and that gets vetted through

622
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:12,649
the system and so i don't know i think

623
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,419
i'd probably be preaching to the choir

624
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,130
to even go further into why this is

625
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:17,900
important so i think i'll just move on

626
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,570
but you can talk to me afterwards if you

627
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,250
want to discuss that further using

628
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:24,470
appropriate plants this was something

629
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,298
that went over a lot of debate and I

630
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,940
know Nina was involved a lot in this

631
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:31,460
discussion too we are trying to a

632
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,710
steward not native plants necessarily

633
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,029
but just appropriate plants so as long

634
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:37,069
as they're not invasive and they're

635
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:39,319
appropriate for the site then that's

636
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:41,659
fine so you could theoretically get

637
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,700
sustainable sites accreditation without

638
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,529
having any native plants on your site if

639
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,860
you so chose there are definitely some

640
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:50,569
credits that encourage native plants and

641
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:53,240
responsible use of native plants but

642
00:25:50,569 --> 00:25:57,109
it's not always the most appropriate to

643
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,370
to be you know only using native plants

644
00:25:57,109 --> 00:25:59,928
so that's not what this is all about

645
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:01,668
it's just making sure that they're

646
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:04,580
appropriate and that they're legally

647
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:07,370
source as well since our industry

648
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:10,849
sometimes has some issues with illegal

649
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:13,219
sourcing of plant material and you know

650
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:15,079
making sure that the nurseries are also

651
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,200
you know in line with that is really

652
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,699
important and using appropriate plants

653
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,740
if you're going for this kind of credit

654
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,200
you might just show a planting plan

655
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,880
similar to this and it's not really all

656
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,279
that complicated you know this is just

657
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,890
an example of one of the submissions for

658
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:32,928
for a project and you know it hopefully

659
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,120
isn't going to be too difficult to to

660
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:36,650
get this credit and just you know do the

661
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,869
checkoff list and make sure you're not

662
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:42,169
you're doing invasive species and you're

663
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:44,178
probably be okay also there's credits to

664
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:48,610
and prerequisites to conserve healthy

665
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:51,860
resources and so some of those include

666
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:54,829
mapping and making sure that you're on

667
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:57,639
top of your creation and management of

668
00:26:54,829 --> 00:27:00,589
vegetation and soil protection zones so

669
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,419
it's always an uphill battle it seems

670
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:04,490
when you're dealing with construction to

671
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:08,690
make sure that you're protecting trees

672
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:10,308
or soil quality that that you've got on

673
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:13,429
your site that are existing that are

674
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:15,349
functional so this is a credit they're

675
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,750
actually this is a prerequisite sorry

676
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:19,668
that designates and communicates your

677
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:22,130
vegetation and soil protection zones at

678
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:23,960
the get-go so this is again not an

679
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:26,090
option you just have to do this and so

680
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,919
hopefully this should be best management

681
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:30,079
practice or proper practice for any

682
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,340
construction project but anybody who's

683
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,079
ever been involved with the project

684
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:35,418
knows that that's not always the obvious

685
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:37,519
thing and keeping on track with that it

686
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:38,840
can be really difficult so I know we

687
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,279
still struggle with this is broken

688
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:42,168
mechanic garden and it's something that

689
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:44,200
I'm always trying to make sure that the

690
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:46,400
specifications we do and with the

691
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,950
management of the projects that were on

692
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,929
top of it but it's so important so this

693
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,700
could be an example of you know

694
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:54,140
communicating where your vegetation and

695
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,390
self protection zones are going to be on

696
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,190
a project you know you would say oh I've

697
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,140
got prime farmland here I don't want to

698
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,240
run that all over with heavy equipment

699
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,620
and destroy the soil quality there I've

700
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,990
got existing native plant communities

701
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:07,639
let's not destroy those by driving

702
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,220
bulldozers all over it or parking our

703
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,830
trucks there then also a special status

704
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,990
vegetation so there's also some credits

705
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:17,720
in the system not just for high quality

706
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,589
native plant communities or farmland

707
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,409
soils but for

708
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:25,528
I guess heritage value specimen so

709
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:27,090
sometimes trees might not be native and

710
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:29,429
they but they might have some sort of

711
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:31,408
other value that is important for you to

712
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:33,538
preserve in the site so try not to

713
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:36,510
destroy all that during the the process

714
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:37,798
is really important there's also an

715
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:40,769
interesting credit that i wanted to

716
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:45,150
mention called optimize biomass and so

717
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:48,509
that is been debated quite a lot but

718
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:51,120
essentially here it's intended to help

719
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:53,609
you support the water nutrient

720
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:58,288
atmospheric gas and climate regulation

721
00:28:53,609 --> 00:29:00,538
system on site by maintaining a sort of

722
00:28:58,288 --> 00:29:03,148
ecological integrity for that site

723
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:06,119
that's comparable to what is in your

724
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:07,288
native plant communities there so well

725
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,928
that might sound a little complicated

726
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:12,089
what all it comes down to is really

727
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:14,490
determining what the terrestrial biomes

728
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:17,250
so what if you're in a desert community

729
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,630
don't try to plant a landscape that is

730
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,548
going to be approximate to what you

731
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,200
would have in the Northeast because

732
00:29:20,548 --> 00:29:24,569
you're going to need so many more water

733
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,808
and nutrient inputs that it's not a very

734
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:29,250
sustainable landscape so and likewise

735
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:32,220
you know you might not want to try to

736
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,509
create a desert landscape and not expect

737
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,669
a lot of success with that if you're

738
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:38,099
trying to do that in a really rainy area

739
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:39,929
you know just be realistic and look at

740
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:41,939
what's around you and look at the

741
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:43,278
resources that will be coming into your

742
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:48,000
site naturally with precipitation

743
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:51,210
climate soils and and just look at that

744
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,089
and be realistic about that and so and

745
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,319
by that then you can sort of what what

746
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:59,398
you're doing there is optimizing your

747
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:01,678
biomass so similarly there's another

748
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:03,898
credit for reducing urban heat island

749
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,538
effect so how do we do that and how do

750
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:09,928
we calculate that well we look at the

751
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:13,079
area of Nan roof areas

752
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:14,639
then you know put in these numbers here

753
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:17,490
you know you got your nan roof measures

754
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:19,459
your area of high reflected roof so in

755
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:22,740
the credit it also takes into account

756
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,990
vegetated areas so you can vegetate your

757
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,450
roof and help to mitigate a little bit

758
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:30,028
urban heat island effect with that but

759
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,490
you can also just change the

760
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:35,878
reflectivity of the surfaces of your

761
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:40,109
site as well so there's options there's

762
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:41,849
options with that also we're looking to

763
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:43,949
use vegetation to minimize building

764
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:45,449
energies it's so this was a really

765
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:49,230
interesting credit that I worked a lot

766
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:51,808
on where we developed calculations to

767
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:54,538
try to prove whether your vegetation on

768
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:58,888
your roof or even around the building

769
00:30:54,538 --> 00:31:01,349
was able to provide reduced energy

770
00:30:58,888 --> 00:31:03,599
benefits to the building itself so by

771
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:04,798
that if you have a green roof you're

772
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,449
likely going to reduce your air

773
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,249
conditioning costs quite significantly

774
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,999
so we've got a calculator to help you

775
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:14,519
with that similarly if you plant certain

776
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:16,079
shade trees at a very specific distance

777
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,720
to your building then you can also

778
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:21,658
derive benefit from shading around and

779
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,490
outside your building that are going to

780
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:25,679
reduce the energy costs for that

781
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,509
building themselves so there you know

782
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,399
the heating and the cooling aspects of

783
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:31,259
this are very interesting and depending

784
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:32,788
on what climate zone you are you might

785
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:35,339
be going more towards the air

786
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:37,528
conditioning reduction through shading

787
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:40,470
or if you're in a northern community can

788
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:42,269
you derive benefit from planting

789
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:45,808
strategic plantings that are going to

790
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:48,179
reduce your eating and so the answer is

791
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:51,240
yes but you have to really think about

792
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:54,330
that and design that as such also

793
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,950
there's a credit which developed and is

794
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:58,499
obviously very important depending on

795
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,419
the area that you're living in and the

796
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:02,610
landscape that you're developing to

797
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:05,369
strategically plans to reduce the risk

798
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:08,368
of catastrophic wildfires so something

799
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:11,490
that's really important that West and so

800
00:32:08,368 --> 00:32:13,798
we worked with forest forest service

801
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:15,509
guidelines from the west coast

802
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:18,960
and there's already quite a lot of data

803
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:20,730
on strategically planting or not

804
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,509
planting things in some click cases

805
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:26,308
close to or around your sites in order

806
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:29,628
to reduce the risk of complete

807
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:31,678
devastation by wildfires also

808
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:33,089
controlling and retaining your

809
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,860
construction pollutants this is

810
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:39,689
something similarly to the maintaining

811
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:41,219
your vegetation and soil protection

812
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,649
zones during the construction process

813
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,538
this is a prerequisite as well you

814
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:48,388
actually have no choice but to do this

815
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:50,579
thank goodness because sometimes during

816
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:53,398
your construction process construction

817
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:55,710
pollutants or other pollutants can can

818
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:58,079
create a lot of havoc and so erosion is

819
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,369
also a big part of this consideration so

820
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,648
you have to prove that you're not

821
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:03,238
creating a worse situation through your

822
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:06,808
construction process through through

823
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:10,259
this rain water management as well so

824
00:33:06,808 --> 00:33:12,210
we're also looking to Stewart different

825
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:15,210
kinds of management of precipitation on

826
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:17,548
the site and improving your runoff

827
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,108
volume and water quality in general and

828
00:33:17,548 --> 00:33:21,329
so a lot of sites have really taken this

829
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:23,668
to heart in the pilot projects at least

830
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:26,038
and have gone on to do a lot of great

831
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:28,739
water management strategies so this is

832
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,898
just an example obviously these are rain

833
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:35,278
gardens and bioswales and a parking lot

834
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:38,518
to control runoff there so now I'm going

835
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:41,429
to go into some actual pilot project

836
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:43,138
examples and show you some of what's

837
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:45,269
come to fruition over the last couple of

838
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:46,918
years through the the testing and

839
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:48,388
refinement of the process so this is

840
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,519
hunts point landing which is in the

841
00:33:48,388 --> 00:33:53,969
Bronx in New York and so this is the

842
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:56,638
before and it's not very pretty this is

843
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:58,829
even further to the water so you can see

844
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:01,168
here it's a highly degraded landscape

845
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:02,908
and yeah I guess you know you've got a

846
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:05,159
couple people who are able to fish there

847
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:09,358
but in general this is not very a very

848
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:12,119
high quality site so luckily the they

849
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:14,190
were able to get a much better design

850
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,750
and implemented here

851
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:18,838
and has anybody ever been to this site

852
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,909
no okay well anyway you can see here

853
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:23,759
that they've installed a whole wonderful

854
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:26,099
landscape here ended up it's become a

855
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,349
major public amenities they still I

856
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:30,269
think allow the fishing to continue so

857
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:32,220
they saw that as a positive on the site

858
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:35,659
already that people were using it as

859
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:39,269
such so it's it's just it's a much nicer

860
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:41,940
area now overall and obviously a lot of

861
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:43,918
sites in the Bronx as you know are

862
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,440
highly degraded and would be considered

863
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:49,348
brownfield so I think this was also in

864
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,510
that category so extra points are

865
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:53,579
awarded for those who choose to take on

866
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,649
a brownfield site and to remediate it

867
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:56,849
and to create a beautiful landscape on

868
00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:58,889
those sites because those can be

869
00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:03,780
particularly challenging and expensive

870
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:06,509
to to manage so these are the points of

871
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,339
breakdown of what this particular pilot

872
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,990
project was able to achieve so you can

873
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:12,539
see here because it was a brownfield

874
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:14,519
they got the maximum amount of points 21

875
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:16,318
points for their site selection just by

876
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:19,170
selecting the brownfield they were off

877
00:35:16,318 --> 00:35:21,088
to a good start then they all also got

878
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,220
for four out of four points for

879
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:25,139
pre-design assessment and planning some

880
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:27,719
pretty good water stewardship points

881
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:29,429
soil and vegetation you know about fifty

882
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,559
fifty percent there but still pretty

883
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:33,179
good material selection they didn't get

884
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:35,009
anything so I'm not sure what went on

885
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:36,358
there but maybe that just wasn't the

886
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,829
priority of the project but it's

887
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:39,598
interesting to see how you could still

888
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:42,119
achieve certification without

889
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,910
necessarily having to go into all of the

890
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:47,818
credits human health and well-being

891
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:49,618
because they kept this to be a good

892
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:52,338
public amenity and it was still a public

893
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:54,510
site they were able to prove value their

894
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:56,789
construction process obviously was

895
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:59,550
pretty well managed and they're still

896
00:35:56,789 --> 00:36:02,309
monitoring it and we're able to also get

897
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:05,250
some innovation points so so this is

898
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:08,309
just a good example and then now here's

899
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:11,818
how it looks today so another great

900
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:17,380
example of is washington canal park and

901
00:36:11,818 --> 00:36:19,690
so this is was a highly degraded site in

902
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:23,710
middle of Washington DC it used to be a

903
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:25,840
bus depot as you can see there and when

904
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:29,110
you take the above view you can see that

905
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:32,530
it was obviously surrounded in you know

906
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:37,870
by dense plant dense not planting dense

907
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:39,730
buildings and that this site was going

908
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:41,980
to likely be a challenge to develop as a

909
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:45,369
sustainable site but they came up with

910
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:49,570
some fantastic solutions to manage this

911
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:52,449
site from here on in with all rainwater

912
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:55,960
and stormwater harvested water supplies

913
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:58,179
so this is a graphic that might be a

914
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,099
little far away for you to see in detail

915
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:01,809
but essentially they're collecting

916
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:06,039
rainwater from all the buildings around

917
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:09,159
this courtyard area and directing the

918
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:12,400
storm water underground and cleaning the

919
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:15,069
water so that it's using this water in

920
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,289
all different ways on the site so here's

921
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:20,800
some examples of their of their rain

922
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:22,719
gardens and and then their collection

923
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,440
mechanisms here which are relatively

924
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:28,599
simple but then they go underground and

925
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,820
recirculate and then they actually even

926
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:34,739
have so essentially rainwater harvested

927
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:38,740
open sort of publicly accessible

928
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:40,659
fountains which if anybody works in when

929
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:42,429
regulations at all this is really

930
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:44,889
difficult to get through the regulatory

931
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:48,480
bodies because for many many years

932
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:53,019
there's been a big fear of not having

933
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:55,360
traditional treated potable water in all

934
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:57,250
your water features for that are

935
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,410
publicly accessible so this is a fight

936
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:01,420
they fought the good fight here and they

937
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:03,609
won because they were able to prove that

938
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,769
they could take storm water and take

939
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:08,079
rain water and clean it to the point

940
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:09,400
where they could have it be you know of

941
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,529
a high enough quality to have children

942
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,470
playing with it so that's really

943
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:16,930
tremendous and so kudos to them this is

944
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:18,079
really a fabulous project not just for

945
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:19,849
that reason but that is

946
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,130
amazing thing that they were able to do

947
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:25,099
so I think luckily they were probably

948
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:27,260
able to connect with the u.s. botanic

949
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:30,079
garden which is a site close by that was

950
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,490
a major developer of this entire system

951
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,590
and probably get them on board to help

952
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:37,189
get the decision makers to make sure

953
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:39,440
that this was ezel to happen so also no

954
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:41,450
I can't forget to mention the cornell

955
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,880
university's man library entrance which

956
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:47,619
is a pilot project that was completed in

957
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:50,269
2012 and it was planted I know through

958
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:52,130
Nina's class now I can't do I can't

959
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:55,159
remember the name of the class is it

960
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:57,680
urban urban Eden that's right ok so it

961
00:38:55,159 --> 00:39:00,289
was planted through and planned through

962
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:02,929
the urban Eden class and so they were

963
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:04,909
able to achieve a one-star rating so one

964
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:07,369
star is absolutely better than no stars

965
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:09,230
so fantastic that they were able to do

966
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:11,659
this and this was also a testing case

967
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,579
for a really small site this site is not

968
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:15,589
that large it's really essentially the

969
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:18,099
the planting areas right in front of the

970
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:20,870
landscape so not the whole quad and

971
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:25,339
they've also been doing tremendous work

972
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:27,469
because there are testing the soil over

973
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:29,390
time and they're feeding the data back

974
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:31,730
on some of the soil remediation work

975
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:34,429
that was done in this particular area

976
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:37,219
back into the site's sort of data

977
00:39:34,429 --> 00:39:38,899
collection process so they they used a

978
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:41,209
scoop and dump technique to remediate

979
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:45,200
the soil which had been heavily impacted

980
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:47,659
by construction so it was basically I

981
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,279
think used in part is a parking lot for

982
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:51,409
some of the construction practices or

983
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,750
maybe a staging area and some air in

984
00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:55,670
some in some respects so all of that can

985
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:58,099
really negatively impact the soil and so

986
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:01,670
they have a control as well they have an

987
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:03,949
area of comparative I guess soil quality

988
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,780
from the time when they started that

989
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:07,549
they're leaving as a control too and so

990
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,550
they're comparing and contrasting how

991
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:11,900
the soil quality is improving over time

992
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:15,320
and I believe they're using the healthy

993
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:17,090
Cornell healthy soils test protocols for

994
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,880
that is anybody familiar with that here

995
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:21,710
yeah so that's that's how they're going

996
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,690
through and so primarily this particular

997
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:26,510
pilot project was a lot about soil

998
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,829
quality and and planting and what what

999
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,870
results you can

1000
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:33,019
over time from that for making

1001
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:34,969
adjustments so I mentioned before that

1002
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:37,699
there's 200 points total for

1003
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:40,699
certification so they're moving more

1004
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:44,029
into the sites certified so baseline or

1005
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:46,489
silver gold and platinum and anything

1006
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:50,330
over 135 points is considered platinum

1007
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:52,569
level or above and the Green Building

1008
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:55,460
Council now taking on the certification

1009
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:57,230
fully I think it's still actually a

1010
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,329
little bit in development so since the

1011
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,949
announcement of the certification

1012
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:03,440
process moving into Green Building

1013
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:06,169
Council status it's still pretty early

1014
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,840
on they're still coming together and

1015
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:11,900
finalizing that so if you're interested

1016
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:14,090
in registering a site as a sustainable

1017
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,099
site you should probably contact the

1018
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,570
sustainable sites people first and you

1019
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:19,549
can actually get registered you can get

1020
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:21,350
on your way with it and of course you

1021
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:23,180
can always use the guidelines the

1022
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:24,949
guidelines you don't have to register

1023
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:26,299
and certify the project to use the

1024
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:28,879
guidelines you just kind of have to have

1025
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:31,460
the book or downloaded so and we always

1026
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,160
encourage anybody to use them we don't

1027
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:36,380
have to go through full certification

1028
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:38,389
even any small component of this has got

1029
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,750
a lot of great material in it so we

1030
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:45,529
encourage that but how it all fits

1031
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:46,820
together long term is GBC I does the

1032
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,500
credentialing and so they're actually a

1033
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,570
separate nonprofit from the US Green

1034
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,429
Building Council and they set this up

1035
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:54,620
deliberately so that the US and Building

1036
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:56,869
Council's lead system wasn't getting

1037
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:58,579
vetted and certified by itself so they

1038
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:01,159
thought in order to avoid the conflict

1039
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:02,480
they have a separate body the GBC I

1040
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:04,909
group that does the actual

1041
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,440
certifications of the projects but the

1042
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:08,230
US Green Building Council is the one

1043
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,789
responsible for professional development

1044
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:13,880
education and so stewardship of the

1045
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:14,960
overall system and so that's really the

1046
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,430
way it's going to work but in

1047
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,500
partnership with the sustainable sites

1048
00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:21,199
team that works out of Lady Bird Johnson

1049
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:24,920
Wildflower Center in Texas of course so

1050
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:27,859
that's mushing together now and is well

1051
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,230
on its way to full accreditation what's

1052
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:32,840
likely to come in a year or two is

1053
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:35,088
professional credentialing so is there

1054
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,999
anybody here who is certified as a lead

1055
00:42:35,088 --> 00:42:39,998
professional know maybe mutt that's

1056
00:42:37,998 --> 00:42:42,919
generally more landscape architecture

1057
00:42:39,998 --> 00:42:45,018
credential but you can be professionally

1058
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,489
certified and credentialed to be a lead

1059
00:42:45,018 --> 00:42:49,488
professional and there's various levels

1060
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:51,889
of lead professional credentialing so

1061
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:55,460
the thought is that you could also be

1062
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:56,568
certified as a professional sites on

1063
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,739
professional sites and I'm not sure

1064
00:42:56,568 --> 00:43:01,608
exactly what they're going to call that

1065
00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:04,190
but that's likely coming in 2017 so

1066
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:08,778
worth mentioning also is landscape for

1067
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:10,219
life which is a somewhat lighter version

1068
00:43:08,778 --> 00:43:12,068
of the sustainable sites initiative

1069
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:15,139
that's being stewarded through the u.s.

1070
00:43:12,068 --> 00:43:19,429
Botanic Garden primarily and its really

1071
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:21,409
an educational program that I it helps

1072
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:23,598
homeowners and folks who aren't really

1073
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:25,879
in the in the landscape perfection

1074
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,309
better understand sustainable sites

1075
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:32,239
there's a lot of heavy data and

1076
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:34,309
information and and work in the

1077
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:35,989
sustainable sites reference guide that

1078
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:37,849
is far beyond what your average home

1079
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:39,440
owner or somebody who's not going to

1080
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:41,838
delve that deeply into it really wants

1081
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,489
to get into so sustainable sites is for

1082
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,558
a professional this is really for

1083
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:47,900
anybody including general

1084
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:49,700
decision-makers who don't really need to

1085
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,829
know all the nitty-gritty details about

1086
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:53,989
it but it gives a lot of the underlying

1087
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:56,450
principles that are also in sustainable

1088
00:43:53,989 --> 00:43:58,838
sites but takes them to a pretty basic

1089
00:43:56,449 --> 00:44:02,389
level and so there's a whole education

1090
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:04,308
program that us botanic garden works

1091
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:06,798
through here so you can get a free

1092
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:08,599
online training or even in course

1093
00:44:06,798 --> 00:44:10,579
training and there's a little bit of a

1094
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:13,759
train-the-trainer component as well so

1095
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:16,278
this is also a great project for folks

1096
00:44:13,759 --> 00:44:17,989
who are in community horticulture and we

1097
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,880
need be horticultural stewardship so

1098
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:21,170
it's worth checking out you can go on

1099
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,180
their website and download a lot of

1100
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:25,999
great materials and connect with them if

1101
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:28,268
you're interested and so with that I

1102
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:34,268
will thank you and I'd love to open up

1103
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:34,268
for any questions Sonia

1104
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:41,220
so the question is what do you do with

1105
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:44,970
existing sites that you don't want to

1106
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:47,159
fully renovate or completely gut and

1107
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:50,129
redo and how to work on those yeah I

1108
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:52,679
think that's a very good thing to think

1109
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:55,410
about on the horizon so my prediction is

1110
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:58,649
that similar to the way the lead system

1111
00:44:55,409 --> 00:45:01,139
has developed over time lead started

1112
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:04,079
with new construction then it moved into

1113
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:05,699
other types of systems that go far

1114
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,650
beyond new construction including

1115
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:10,049
existing buildings operations and

1116
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,670
maintenance and lead for neighborhoods

1117
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:14,160
which is at a whole different scale for

1118
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:16,980
urban planning and so on and so forth so

1119
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,449
I predict that sites could go in that

1120
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,119
direction as well and so we've

1121
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:24,359
definitely talked about that but

1122
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:26,609
existing sites existing site operations

1123
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:30,450
and maintenance is definitely a whole

1124
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:32,309
different scene so but probably that

1125
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:33,509
will come yeah it's just going to take

1126
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:34,860
some time they're going to have to get

1127
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,990
through the professional credentialing

1128
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:40,650
first and then get make sure that the

1129
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:42,750
new the new project the new project

1130
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,730
system is well underway before they get

1131
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:47,489
well that's a really good question too

1132
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:49,920
so the follow up so I think one thing

1133
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:52,469
that we hope through the development of

1134
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,599
sites to do is to have follow-up and to

1135
00:45:52,469 --> 00:45:56,879
not just say All Right see you later

1136
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:58,829
here's your certification and then you

1137
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,480
could let it all go to pot in theory and

1138
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:02,069
you would still have your site

1139
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,369
certification that's something that we

1140
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:07,830
really don't want to happen but the cost

1141
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:10,440
to come back and keep checking on sites

1142
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:14,340
over time is actually quite significant

1143
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:16,679
so I should mention that there's

1144
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:20,640
actually a flat rate pretty much right

1145
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:22,379
now to be registered and to be going

1146
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:24,509
through the certification process so

1147
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,670
regardless of the size of your site at

1148
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:29,550
this point it ranges between about

1149
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:33,000
twenty five hundred dollars to like nine

1150
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:34,530
thousand depending on how you're going

1151
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,949
to go through certification and that's

1152
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:40,890
just kind of like a flat fee and so in

1153
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:41,589
order to be able to afford through the

1154
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:44,379
management

1155
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:46,750
system to be sending people back there

1156
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:48,430
may have to be like an add on after the

1157
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:50,559
fact so that you can kind of keep your

1158
00:46:48,429 --> 00:46:52,089
certification over time and I think what

1159
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,730
the landscape side of it it really makes

1160
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:57,039
sense to do that long-term and to try to

1161
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:59,380
you know just keep checking up on it the

1162
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,449
lead system from what I understand

1163
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:04,539
doesn't really have that so once you get

1164
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:07,449
your LEED Platinum certification there

1165
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:10,119
there isn't at this point and they maybe

1166
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:11,829
they're changing this a way to go back

1167
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:13,420
and ensure that that particular building

1168
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:16,090
that's been certified for new

1169
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:18,820
construction is operating optimally or

1170
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:20,620
still operating with all the principles

1171
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:24,340
in place so it's an interesting

1172
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:28,449
challenge well as I think with all of

1173
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:30,640
these semi competitive systems like the

1174
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:32,889
competitive nature and people is one

1175
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,440
hopeful monk patient even though that

1176
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:37,059
can sometimes come out of the negative

1177
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,010
we want people to compete to be the most

1178
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:41,170
sustainable in their landscape design

1179
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:42,850
construction and maintenance so I think

1180
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:45,340
that's definitely one factor that like

1181
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:49,119
it or not you know we we tend to have

1182
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:51,670
that is 11 motivation also anybody who's

1183
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,920
gone through the pilot process and look

1184
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:56,800
deeply at the system I think really

1185
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,650
finds that they learn a lot too through

1186
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,539
the process so hopefully that's one

1187
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:04,869
motivation and just wanting to get on

1188
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:05,980
track for sustainability long term is

1189
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:09,069
something that I think is really

1190
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,389
important to keep in mind as well also

1191
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:13,090
I'm coming from a public garden

1192
00:48:10,389 --> 00:48:15,579
standpoint and a lot of public gardens

1193
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:17,260
have figured out that they just need to

1194
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:19,239
do this no matter what that we need to

1195
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,680
be the leader so there's been a lot of

1196
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:23,709
great leadership in the public garden

1197
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:25,539
world already in working with

1198
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:28,030
sustainable sites as i mentioned phipps

1199
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:29,769
conservatory us botanic garden Lady Bird

1200
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,420
Johnson Wildflower Center a lot of

1201
00:48:29,769 --> 00:48:33,340
public gardens have taken this on and

1202
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,440
felt that they just have to do this to

1203
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:37,059
maintain the brand that they have

1204
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,309
because it's expected that we'd be

1205
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:41,440
really top notch not only in our

1206
00:48:39,309 --> 00:48:43,509
landscapes in general and how beautiful

1207
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,990
they look but also in all the underlying

1208
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,550
sustainability

1209
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:49,659
in the design and management of those

1210
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:53,330
systems so it seems like easy for us

1211
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:56,149
whether your typical privately managed

1212
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:57,829
landscape or privately owned or

1213
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:00,019
industrial landscape wants to go to this

1214
00:48:57,829 --> 00:49:01,579
I think it may be something about you

1215
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:03,409
know brand management that they want to

1216
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:05,059
push forward also and I know that I

1217
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:07,789
think what Stuart it a lot of it would

1218
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:11,119
lead our early stage and high-ranking

1219
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:13,159
lead projects as well well so the

1220
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,590
interesting thing is some of these

1221
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:17,929
sections you actually can't ever get all

1222
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:20,990
of them because it's almost like an

1223
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:24,259
either/or so either you're doing if you

1224
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:26,419
don't have certain site conditions you

1225
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:28,640
just can't do it and so it's not that

1226
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,750
you should be penalized for not doing it

1227
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:31,879
and so that's the challenge with the

1228
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:33,050
scoring system you might always feel

1229
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,940
that if you don't get everything that

1230
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:36,710
you're not doing the best but if they

1231
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,389
you don't have a natural area you can't

1232
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:40,099
get a credit for protecting natural

1233
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:42,109
heirs because you just don't have one or

1234
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:44,029
if you don't have a wetland on site

1235
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:46,190
already you can't get a credit for

1236
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:48,110
predicting an existing wetland so

1237
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:49,700
there's several credits like that that

1238
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,559
are really optional and so it's not

1239
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:53,929
designed that you can get all of them so

1240
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:55,279
so that's partially the problem or it's

1241
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:59,599
not really a problem it's just the way

1242
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:02,470
it is yeah in the town just east of here

1243
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:05,710
we have don't even in sin

1244
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:08,939
lead antenna like to see just added to

1245
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:12,789
that the problem we run into is that

1246
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:14,530
because it's a qualitative is the

1247
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:18,250
assignment a point to somewhat

1248
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:22,000
qualitative we find we have proposals

1249
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:25,389
that are offering very different

1250
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,820
ecosystem service levels but they both

1251
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:33,759
qualify for getting the incentive so

1252
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:36,519
that is a constant problem trying to to

1253
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,260
make sure the rating system matches the

1254
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:43,599
benefit that they're actually bringing

1255
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:46,420
yeah oh it's it's very very big and deep

1256
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:49,059
and wide challenge I don't know any

1257
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:51,760
other way to say it's there's a lot to

1258
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:55,029
think about here and trying to Stewart a

1259
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,590
holistic system and to think about all

1260
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,140
the different parameters and all the

1261
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:02,230
different ways that we could be

1262
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:04,059
quantifying and calculating properly is

1263
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:06,369
really it's really challenging but it's

1264
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:07,750
a lot of fun thank goodness like it is

1265
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:09,640
fun to I should have mentioned that

1266
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:12,130
that's kind of my motivation it's like

1267
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:13,989
all right I'm gonna I'm going to you

1268
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:17,700
know hurt my brain a lot doing this but

1269
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:17,699
it's but it's for the best hopefully
