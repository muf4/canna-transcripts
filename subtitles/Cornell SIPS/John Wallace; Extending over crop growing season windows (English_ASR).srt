1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,969
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:10,320
University well I'm super jazzed about

3
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:12,120
today many of my favorite researchers

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,789
and favorite farmers are here today so

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:18,899
I'm really looking forward to the the

6
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:21,509
rest of the day yeah so my name is John

7
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,070
Wallace I just started at Cornell and

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,900
I'm gonna be working in specialty crop

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:30,689
systems and when it comes to talking

10
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,820
about use cover crops to suppress weeds

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,850
I really feel like I'm just the

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,558
messenger so I've really had the

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,760
pleasure to work with a host of

14
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:43,019
researchers in the Northeast for the

15
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,558
last several years who have been

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,010
thinking about this and the idea is I'm

17
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:53,429
going to talk about a lot longer than me

18
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:55,769
and then an important part of this story

19
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:59,189
are the farmers who are putting these

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,129
ideas into practice and several

21
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:04,829
gentlemen who have provided engineering

22
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:09,750
solutions that have allowed us to use

23
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:11,429
cover crops in new ways and then I also

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,700
thought it was important important to

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,860
note that when this group of scientists

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,379
over here when we write papers we

27
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:22,049
typically end up citing the work of

28
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,859
Chuck Moeller and John Teasdale who did

29
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,750
a lot of really important early work

30
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:33,209
looking at cover crop and weed

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,950
interactions so I'm working off of the

32
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,019
assumption that since you guys are here

33
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,259
today we're gonna be in general

34
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,629
agreement that cover crops are a

35
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,920
potential tool and the integrated weed

36
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:48,569
management toolbox or one of the many

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,849
little hammers that we can employ to

38
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:53,129
achieve certain long-term weed

39
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:54,959
management objectives and so when we

40
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,968
turn when we think about long term

41
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,298
integrated weed management we're

42
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:03,390
thinking about maintaining low weed seed

43
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,118
banks and annual cropping systems and

44
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,159
also preventing population spikes so

45
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,199
kind of buffering against those years

46
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,229
when we have poor weed control and

47
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,299
really high weed seed rain

48
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:17,068
and then also what we want to do with an

49
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,790
integrated weed management approach is

50
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:24,509
to prevent weeds that become adapted to

51
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:27,658
our system so adapted weed species and

52
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:31,019
so we also we know a little bit about

53
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:33,959
the mechanisms the mechanisms by which

54
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:36,330
cover crops suppress weeds and disrupt

55
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,810
weed life cycles and so whether we're

56
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,120
talking about a living color cover or

57
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:46,140
surface mulch or residue

58
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,239
we know that the cover crops can affect

59
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:51,750
what's going on in the weed seed bank by

60
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,840
alternating germination cues so light

61
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,180
quality changes in soil temperatures

62
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,439
soil moisture that trigger weed seed

63
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:04,140
germination cover crops can also enhance

64
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:07,378
habitat for seed predators so grain of

65
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:10,828
Orr's that can also help drive down weed

66
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:13,289
seed banks and we also have some

67
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:16,230
evidence that cover crops influence

68
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:18,959
microbial diversity in the soil and that

69
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:23,759
diversity can contribute to greater weed

70
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:26,609
see decay and then above-ground we know

71
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,489
that a living cover through competition

72
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:32,219
or the surface mulch through physical

73
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,930
interference can kind of preempt

74
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:38,969
resources away from from weeds and

75
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:42,200
influence by altering so the moisture

76
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:45,719
dynamics the nitrogen availability

77
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:48,018
increasing competition for light and all

78
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:51,979
those things can contribute to either

79
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:54,900
mortality of emerged needs or at least

80
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:59,328
kind of decreasing the amount of seed

81
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,329
rain in annual cropping systems

82
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,920
so the intensity by which cover crops

83
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:09,699
influence those weed life cycles is

84
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:12,789
really a function of certain life

85
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:14,649
history traits of weeds and as well

86
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:19,779
where you're employing cover crops

87
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:21,850
within a rotation and so if we're kind

88
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:24,309
of thinking about business as usual

89
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,500
where we're using cover crops in the

90
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,500
shoulder seasons within an annual crop

91
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,290
rotation we're very likely have pretty

92
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,680
dramatic effects with on winter annual

93
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:40,169
weeds like mayor's tail that germinate

94
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:43,720
in the fall or in the spring but we may

95
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:47,259
kind of have marginal effects on summer

96
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,150
annual weed species so we might prevent

97
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,788
some weed seed germination for early

98
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:54,069
emerging summer annuals but for summer

99
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:58,509
annuals that have peak emergence periods

100
00:04:54,069 --> 00:05:00,189
in crop in a summer annual crop cover

101
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:04,769
crops likely have pretty marginal

102
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:08,350
effects on weed seed on weed dynamics

103
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:10,870
and so you know in the two extremes and

104
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,689
when we're in an annual crop rotation

105
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,149
say in a full tillage organic system or

106
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:19,990
in a continuous no-till conventional

107
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:22,949
system where and we're relying on either

108
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,889
these these big hammers tillage or

109
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:30,939
multiple passes of herbicides were very

110
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:33,879
likely to be still selecting for adapted

111
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:36,788
wheat species and those systems and

112
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:39,909
cover crops may have a marginal marginal

113
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:44,560
effect so what I'd like to talk about

114
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:47,710
today is opportunities for making cover

115
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,918
crops a bigger hammer in the integrated

116
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:53,109
weed management toolbox in conservation

117
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:56,288
tillage systems both organic and

118
00:05:53,110 --> 00:06:01,800
conventional systems by moving cover

119
00:05:56,288 --> 00:06:06,038
crops closer or into summer annual crop

120
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,168
rotations and so the two common things

121
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:10,240
going on there are the need to move away

122
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,500
from kind of business as usual and

123
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,660
either terminating a cover

124
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,089
with herbicides or tillage early and

125
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,630
delaying termination to allow cover

126
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:24,189
crops to get big and then relying on a

127
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:30,040
surface mulch residue for increase weed

128
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:32,949
suppression so we've been working we

129
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,650
know quite a bit about using this kind

130
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:38,469
of high residue cover crop mulch system

131
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:40,810
in organic systems so in the Northeast

132
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:44,290
there's been probably over a decade of

133
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,030
research looking at this system and what

134
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,120
we would call a cover crop based or

135
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:51,909
organic rotational no-till system and so

136
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,189
what I want to do is just touch on how

137
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,890
that system works what we've learned and

138
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:58,959
then if we can take what we've learned

139
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,060
from that system and start to employ

140
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:04,479
that in more of a conventional

141
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,030
continuous no-till system so to really

142
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:14,319
make cover crops a bigger tool in the

143
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:18,699
integrated weed management toolbox so we

144
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:22,779
employ this system both in a no-till

145
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:26,079
corn or a no-till soybean phase of the

146
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:28,959
rotation and I'm just going to use for

147
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:32,199
example a no-till soybeans system so in

148
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,639
this particular system many are you many

149
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,189
of you are going to be familiar with it

150
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,250
the idea is to grow a big cover crop and

151
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:41,379
so we really prioritize optimizing

152
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,029
getting that cover crop established in

153
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:45,490
front of soybeans who are typically

154
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:47,619
growing cereal rye so we're getting that

155
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,240
cover crop in early at a high seeding

156
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,959
rate with the idea of growing a big

157
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:56,978
cover and we're terminating cereal rye

158
00:07:52,959 --> 00:08:00,120
at flowering at thisis with a roller

159
00:07:56,978 --> 00:08:02,918
crimper and then we're no-till planting

160
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,290
soybeans directly into that so that

161
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:08,289
mulch and what's critical is this

162
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:11,080
trade-off of when we're doing minimal

163
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:13,979
kind of disturbance at planting in row

164
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:17,409
we do a better job of suppressing weeds

165
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:20,848
but we consistently consistently see a

166
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,679
trade-off where sometimes it's harder to

167
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:28,438
good crop establishment when we're

168
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:30,799
planting into that big residue and so

169
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,120
we're not always going to get the

170
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,068
biomass that we think we need so

171
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,110
typically in that system we think we

172
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:39,088
probably need about three tons of dry

173
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,250
matter biomass to get a really good beat

174
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:43,860
suppressive mulch

175
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,360
when we terminate the cover crop and so

176
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,699
we've been thinking about integrated

177
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,430
weed management approaches and so we've

178
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:53,129
been integrating the use of a high

179
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:56,669
residue cultivator in this system and so

180
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:58,500
the way that that works is there's these

181
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:01,979
high residue sweeps they're about 20

182
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,589
inches wide and they don't invert the

183
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,159
soil so they kill weeds by actually

184
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:10,980
severing the roots and so that allows

185
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:14,838
you to go in later than what we would

186
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:18,360
typically use in Tyrell cultivation and

187
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,759
make what we what we have found is two

188
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,970
passes about four or five weeks after

189
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:26,550
planting generally optimizes in row weed

190
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:31,649
control when we integrate this high

191
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:34,588
residue cultivator into the system so

192
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,778
here's some data from a long term

193
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:39,120
organic cropping systems experiment

194
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:42,448
that's looking at these rotational

195
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,339
no-till approaches at Penn State this is

196
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:48,359
some data from Rebecca Champaign who's a

197
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:50,130
master student there and so in this

198
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,370
cropping systems experiment of Penn

199
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:56,519
State we have we're comparing kind of

200
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:59,490
full tillage soybean production with

201
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:02,759
this rotational no.2 approach using the

202
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:05,490
cover crops and the roller crimper and

203
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,800
so this this data is late-season weed

204
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,430
biomass for three different crop years

205
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:14,389
and the lead biomass is broken down by

206
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:19,349
in row weeds and then between row weeds

207
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:21,870
and so on x-axis you can also see the

208
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,420
number of cultivation passes so for the

209
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,850
full tillage system we're using blind

210
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:28,828
cultivation or interval cultivation

211
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,889
somewhere between three or six times a

212
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:34,539
year depending on weather conditions and

213
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:37,810
then kind of adaptively using

214
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:40,000
hi residue cultivation in the no-till

215
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:42,819
system and you can see here what kind of

216
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,200
biomass we were getting it with the

217
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:49,140
cereal rye cover crop so looking at this

218
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,640
data what have we really learned about

219
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:56,080
the viability of the no-till approach

220
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:59,350
one is that if you look across the

221
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:03,280
rotation we're seeing pretty comparable

222
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:05,080
levels of weed suppression between the

223
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,970
no-till approach and the full tillage

224
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:11,800
approach and we also are seeing that

225
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,930
both of these types of systems are

226
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,689
pretty vulnerable to we control failures

227
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:19,779
and those we control failures happen are

228
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:24,190
primarily a function of we control

229
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:26,379
failures in row so in 2016 in the full

230
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,810
tillage right after planting we stayed

231
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:31,269
wet we couldn't get into blind

232
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:33,009
cultivation and then when it dried up we

233
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:35,529
couldn't we couldn't get those weeds out

234
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:38,019
of the row the story is a little bit

235
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,120
different in the no-till system so in

236
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:43,629
that system we had a pretty high weed

237
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,509
seed bank inputs in 2016 which was a

238
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:49,120
challenging year and the in row weeds

239
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:55,000
are probably due to too much soil

240
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:57,159
disturbance at planting and then we're

241
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,500
also finding that which i think is

242
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:01,779
important because a lot of the original

243
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,590
work was really thinking about driving

244
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:04,839
up

245
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,600
Serio rye biomass to get a better weed

246
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,220
suppressive mulching you see that from

247
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,139
year to year

248
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,540
weed control is not really a function of

249
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:16,240
how much Sarabhai biomass and and part

250
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:18,730
of that is the ability to have this

251
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,070
integrated approach where we use high

252
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,720
residue cultivation and what I'm not

253
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,090
showing is the weed species breakdown

254
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,649
and if I did what you would see is both

255
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:31,000
of these systems are pretty vulnerable

256
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:34,480
to species becoming adapted so in each

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,909
year the proportion of total weeds we

258
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,690
saw giant foxtail become more and more

259
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:44,169
dominant in these systems and so it's

260
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,310
just another another data point that

261
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:46,748
suggests that

262
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:49,088
we need to think about integrated

263
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:54,060
approaches within season and across

264
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:57,790
rotations to really manage manage weeds

265
00:12:54,059 --> 00:13:00,099
okay so what are the opportunities for

266
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:04,139
kind of thinking about using this high

267
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:07,689
residue surface multi-protein continuous

268
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:09,129
conventional no-till systems and so

269
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:10,990
we've we've been thinking about that and

270
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:13,209
and one of the one of the things that

271
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:17,379
have made this approach more conceivable

272
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:22,119
is this small engineering solution so

273
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:24,999
this this is a integrated roller crimper

274
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:28,058
it's called a er X his own residue

275
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:31,149
manager system Don biologic sells it now

276
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:35,649
it was it was fabricated by a

277
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:38,139
Pennsylvania no-till farmer and what

278
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:41,198
this allows you to do is to a roll and

279
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:43,568
plant in one pass so you can mount these

280
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,979
on on the frame ahead of your no-till

281
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:46,568
planter so there would be a slicing

282
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,680
residue behind here followed by the

283
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:52,299
no-till planter units and it also allows

284
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:56,708
you to be a little more aggressive with

285
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:59,289
these double disc row cleaners in in row

286
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:01,119
and so when we're using herbicides in

287
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:02,409
this system we can be a little more

288
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,409
aggressive to make sure that we're

289
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:10,350
establishing a good crop and use

290
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:13,679
herbicides to control weeds in the row

291
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:16,930
and so we've been trying to think about

292
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:19,000
how this approach is going to influence

293
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:21,489
herbicide programs or the use of

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,490
herbicides in these systems and so

295
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,930
there's a couple of things going on one

296
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,329
when we're using kind of the roller

297
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:31,448
crimper approach in a conventional

298
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:33,278
system we have a lot more flexibility

299
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:34,808
and when we termination terminate the

300
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,448
cover crop and that's really important

301
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:40,028
because it's not really just how much

302
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:41,469
biomass you're getting but we're

303
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:42,970
consistently challenged by weather

304
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,980
conditions when you can get into the

305
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,610
field and terminate a cover crop and so

306
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:51,159
being able to use burndown herbicides

307
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:53,949
allow us a little more flexibility in

308
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:56,159
managing the cover crop residue and then

309
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:58,870
we what we would like to think is that

310
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,509
by moving to this kind of

311
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:04,028
residue mulch approach we have the

312
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:06,939
opportunities to reduce the amount of

313
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:08,950
residual herbicides or post herbicides

314
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,930
that we're going to rely on in a

315
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,690
continuous no-till system and that is

316
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:16,179
really critical given that northeast is

317
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,400
now seeing the introduction of more and

318
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:21,629
more glyphosate resistant weeds in our

319
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,069
notes whole cropping systems and so

320
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:26,528
thinking broadly about this we're

321
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,510
thinking that adopting this approach of

322
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:31,629
these higher residue mall systems and

323
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:33,129
continuous no-till is potentially

324
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:35,139
critical enough where we're thinking

325
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:39,250
about preserving conservation tillage

326
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:40,750
systems by diversifying our weed

327
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,330
management approach which allows us to

328
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,339
preserve effective herbicides and we do

329
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:50,440
that by preventing the evolution of

330
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:54,310
herbicide resistant weeds and if that's

331
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:58,300
gonna happen we really think that it was

332
00:15:54,309 --> 00:16:00,609
necessary for cover crops and herbicide

333
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:02,319
programs to be complementary and so when

334
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:04,720
we're thinking about complementarity

335
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:09,339
between herbicides and cover crops were

336
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,899
thinking about three things so this is

337
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:13,839
how we're thinking about if cover crops

338
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:16,419
are complementary if at the time of a

339
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,100
herbicide application were spraying

340
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:19,899
fewer weeds because if we're spraying

341
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,690
fewer weeds for removing selection

342
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:25,059
pressure away from herbicides and that

343
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:28,140
mortality pressure is coming from the

344
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:34,629
cover crops and that's a positive thing

345
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:36,970
it's okay so and then it's also a

346
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:41,200
complementary if we reducing weed size

347
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:45,129
at the time of application so extension

348
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:47,379
weed scientists everywhere always talk

349
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:50,559
about the finger roll or the soda-can

350
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:53,379
rule and that killing weeds with

351
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:56,469
herbicides is a dose is about dose

352
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:58,000
response and so if leads are smaller one

353
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,420
drop of a herbicide is going to be more

354
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,830
effective when they're smaller at the

355
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:05,318
same time if we're spraying smaller

356
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:08,350
weeds and we're spraying through a cover

357
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:10,959
crop there's the potential for kind of

358
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:12,908
interference from the cover crop

359
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:17,078
that may potentially reduce herbicide

360
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:19,270
efficacy so I'm just gonna show some

361
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:22,078
data that kind of looks at this

362
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:24,490
complementarity issue and so this is

363
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,198
this is a mayor's tale example so

364
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,909
mayor's tails are wearing a weed it's

365
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:32,048
probably the poster child for glyphosate

366
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:34,059
resistant weeds in the Northeast and so

367
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:36,609
the selection pressure is occurring at

368
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:39,278
burndown and so what we would like to

369
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:42,428
see is to spray fewer mayor's tail

370
00:17:39,278 --> 00:17:45,880
plants at burn down and what this data

371
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:48,880
shows is across four different years the

372
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:52,480
the this is a mayor's tail density the

373
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,760
black lines are no cover crop plot the

374
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,038
green lines are where we have a cereal

375
00:17:54,759 --> 00:18:00,308
rye cover crop and you can see that in

376
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:02,558
three out of four years the potential

377
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:04,418
for reducing the number of weeds that

378
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,839
were spraying removing selection

379
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:08,940
pressure away from those herbicides is

380
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,609
potentially greater than ninety percent

381
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:16,298
so that's that's a really positive

382
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:18,278
outcome so this is the same data and so

383
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:19,778
how big were those horse weed plants

384
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:23,380
when we were using a burned-down

385
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:26,019
herbicide to kill them and so the top

386
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,690
this is two different ears and the top

387
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:32,349
is with the no cover the bottom is with

388
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:34,509
cereal rye and you can see that when we

389
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:36,308
don't have the cover we're increasing

390
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:37,269
the probability of violating the

391
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:39,038
soda-can rule

392
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:42,038
so we're spraying bare weeds when we

393
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:44,079
don't have the cover crop there and when

394
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:47,798
we do the cover crop we've really

395
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:52,778
constrained weed size and and we're

396
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:56,589
spraying smaller weeds okay so this is

397
00:18:52,778 --> 00:19:00,460
some data from Jess panchak who is

398
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:03,038
working on this idea of interference so

399
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,419
the potential for cover crops to

400
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:08,798
interfere with the efficacy of

401
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:11,620
herbicides and so this is here this is

402
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:14,859
herbicide spray coverage at the time of

403
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:17,250
burndown herbicide application this is

404
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:20,979
the amount of ground cover that we have

405
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:22,670
and so you see the control 0 rye and a

406
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,910
rye hairy vetch cover crop

407
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:28,700
and you can see that as you increase

408
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:31,730
ground cover with a cover crop the

409
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:35,390
deposition of the herbicide goes down

410
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:38,120
and so this is potential negative trade

411
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:42,530
off associated with with using cover

412
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:44,269
crops oh yeah so I have pictures so

413
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:46,490
that's the picture she was using spray

414
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:48,440
cards to actually measure this so that

415
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:51,710
that's what looks that's the herbicide

416
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,460
deposition and a no cover crop plot and

417
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:59,059
in a hairy vetch here at rye cover crop

418
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:05,059
yeah couple more slides ok all right

419
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:07,909
so mmm so that's that's kind of winter

420
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:10,759
annuals where we really have kind of

421
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,940
potential to really drive weed

422
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:16,700
suppression or increase weed suppression

423
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,200
with cover cropping so what about those

424
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,289
summer annual weeds that have peak

425
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,910
emergence periods in crop particularly

426
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:25,819
late emerging weeds like pig weed

427
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,620
species and so how much weed suppression

428
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:30,169
can we get out of that surface mulch

429
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:32,149
residue so this is this is a data set

430
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,700
from the same set of experiments what

431
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:37,310
we're looking at pigweed density at the

432
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,150
time of a post emergent application so

433
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:44,899
about three weeks after planting and

434
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:48,080
this is a x-axis UFC arrived biomass at

435
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:51,110
burned down and so we have no cover crop

436
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:54,409
plots we have CRI plots where we

437
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:56,029
terminated at the boot stage and then

438
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,910
where we terminated at the heading stage

439
00:20:56,029 --> 00:21:01,759
and you can see that increasing the

440
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:04,570
amount of biomass prior determination

441
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:06,859
increases the surface residue and while

442
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:08,839
compared a horse weed it may be more a

443
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:11,479
more marginal effect we're still driving

444
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:12,769
down or we're so increasing weed

445
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,360
suppression and those summer annual

446
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:21,230
weeds same idea with what are we doing

447
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:23,359
to weed size so probably not as

448
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:26,029
demonstrable is kind of the horse weed

449
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:30,109
data but we're still seeing that when we

450
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:33,049
have the surface malas to do there we we

451
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:34,908
have fewer weeds they're getting big at

452
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:39,460
the time of a post emergent application

453
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:42,649
so we're probably slightly more probable

454
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,720
to violate the finger rule or the

455
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:50,258
soda-can rule and the no cover crop

456
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:53,079
control okay so just to wrap things up I

457
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:55,940
would like to think from this data that

458
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:59,058
the question of can we make cover crops

459
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,220
a bigger tool in the toolbox in an

460
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:02,868
integrated way management approach by

461
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,618
moving to this high residue surface

462
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:09,108
mulch we see a lot of signs that this

463
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:10,970
this could be effective but I also

464
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:12,710
didn't talk about all the potential

465
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,048
agronomic trade-offs I talked about the

466
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,278
weed suppression benefits and so if we

467
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:19,878
want to move forward and make this

468
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:23,239
something that is really viable there's

469
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:25,009
still some challenges and so in organic

470
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:26,298
system the organic no-till system I

471
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:28,579
think one of the the critical challenges

472
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:30,739
is just getting these consistent crop

473
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:33,019
stands while minimizing in row

474
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:35,778
disturbance and so that that might be

475
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:38,028
just a technological fix in conventional

476
00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:40,069
systems we still have all these question

477
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:43,278
marks so what about this interference

478
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:45,079
question trade offs are we adding

479
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:47,450
additional pest pressure other than

480
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:49,339
weeds yield drags do the shortened

481
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:52,909
seasons so these are important questions

482
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:54,589
I talked solely about CRI alone I didn't

483
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:56,570
talk about mixtures so when we start

484
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:58,999
thinking about integrating cover crop

485
00:22:56,569 --> 00:23:01,368
mixtures into the end of the question we

486
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:04,278
maybe will add we have greater weed

487
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:07,128
suppression but probably increase the

488
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:10,929
complexity of management and then

489
00:23:07,128 --> 00:23:13,189
finally this approach requires

490
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:16,460
investments in capital and new equipment

491
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:21,580
and so is that investment really worth

492
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:25,999
long term conservation benefits sorry

493
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:28,989
okay so I hope I have time for a couple

494
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:28,989
questions or comments

495
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:36,889
[Applause]

496
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,829
we're using

497
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:55,659
the no-till approach versus the oh yeah

498
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:57,339
so totally different cultivation

499
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:59,470
equipment so in the no-till systems

500
00:23:57,339 --> 00:24:04,808
we're using that high residue sweep so

501
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:06,909
one one sweep and then in the in the

502
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:09,730
pool tillage system we would be using

503
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:11,860
blank cultivation so either a tiny weed

504
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:15,960
or a rotor Harrow and then just

505
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:15,959
