1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,278
[Applause]

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,278
thanks a lot Andy it's a pleasure to be

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:20,618
here for many reasons because Andy is a

6
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:21,609
very very good friend and I missed him

7
00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:23,859
when he left

8
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:29,350
submit for Cornell I was a bit upset

9
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:31,210
about Cornell of course but I think it's

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,730
also because I know Cornell for a long

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,058
time and that's my first visit ever so I

12
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:39,279
think I know content by reputation by

13
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:42,159
its good reputation by the publication's

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,620
and by many colleagues who graduated

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,718
from from Cornell and we've worked in

16
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:50,649
the CG or still working in the CG system

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,870
so many things to be so numerous here

18
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:55,570
today and when I gave a similar image

19
00:00:52,869 --> 00:01:01,539
here if usually small room so it's it's

20
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:03,850
great I will try to give you an overview

21
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:06,420
of the work we do in submit through the

22
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,739
lens of mechanization and its

23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,709
representation I made for the board we

24
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:13,748
our board of trustees

25
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:16,149
you know I want to know a bit more about

26
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:18,218
our programs and they usually want to

27
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:21,248
have something on mechanization I say

28
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:23,408
not again mechanization so this

29
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:25,598
presentation is not a bad mechanization

30
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:27,579
it's the lens of mechanization and

31
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:31,868
system and intensification through the

32
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:34,178
lens of mechanization before I start I

33
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:36,879
have a couple of slides about the CGI

34
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:41,109
our research centres and I how many of

35
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:45,278
you heard about the CG I don't need to

36
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:47,408
explain it very long so the city was

37
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:53,468
created at the end of the 60s beginning

38
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:54,939
of the 70s as a body of centers I think

39
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:57,218
initially they were just few centers

40
00:01:54,938 --> 00:02:00,098
submit is one of the oldest one and we

41
00:01:57,218 --> 00:02:03,099
just celebrated our 50 and over Surrey

42
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:05,500
and not so long ago two years ago

43
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:07,839
where's the mandate to look at research

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,389
for development or research in

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,459
development so the the the CG was

46
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:15,429
created with now we have about 15

47
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:16,719
centers a lot of changes that fill up

48
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,819
and in the next two years and I don't

49
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,939
want to go into that because it's made a

50
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:25,329
big interrelation mark our the CG will

51
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:28,419
will be shaped in two years time but it

52
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:30,520
was created just to cover most of the

53
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:33,030
developing countries but in term of

54
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,459
geographies and also in term of domotics

55
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,669
so Simmons is the center working on

56
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,020
maize and wheat so it's known as

57
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:43,629
International maize and wheat

58
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,090
Improvement Center we do much more than

59
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:48,549
reading because we are still very well

60
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:54,340
known by a by a breeding component but

61
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:57,790
we do much more than than reading and we

62
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,180
are also I word about the CRP CGI

63
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:03,519
research programs

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,980
much less it's not as popular that was

65
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,680
the last reform of the CG that was about

66
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:14,199
eight years eight nine years ago so

67
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,629
research research programs were created

68
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:20,109
and they are about 15 research programs

69
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:22,239
we are leading to research programs one

70
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,610
on maize one on wheat

71
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,989
we are also leading a platform which is

72
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,959
something a bit different than a problem

73
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:32,110
and newer the excellence in reading and

74
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,420
we are part of the agriculture for

75
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:38,560
nutrition and health led by if free and

76
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:42,219
also by the the seek after time exchange

77
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,879
ERP which is led by ICF we are also

78
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:47,829
contributing to the Big Data Platform

79
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,319
the gene bank platform and to the PIM

80
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:53,739
the policy institutions and markets so

81
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,530
it's those efforts I made for us to work

82
00:03:53,739 --> 00:04:00,039
better together as as a body of of

83
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:02,530
centuries let's go back to cistern

84
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:06,129
abandon intensification through the lens

85
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,340
of of mechanization and I thought that

86
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:11,229
my presentation to the board would be

87
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,090
boring and I really got excited the more

88
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:14,619
I thought about that and the more I

89
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,930
developed my slides I thought well

90
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,449
that's a really nice exercise just

91
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,569
take something as you know narrowest

92
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:26,819
mechanization and just look at its

93
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:31,180
impact in the system so the key messages

94
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:33,478
we are probably d by father the center

95
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,250
having the largest portfolio on

96
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:39,008
mechanization if free has worked a bit

97
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:43,629
on mechanization but mostly on the on

98
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:46,120
the policy issue we work in Asia Africa

99
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:48,759
and Latin America that's you know we

100
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,569
submit as offices in several countries

101
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:55,030
and we are covering our regions as Latin

102
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:57,310
America but mainly in Mexico but also

103
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:58,149
subscribe Africa mostly Eastern and

104
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,129
Southern Africa

105
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:01,870
and then South Asia where we have the

106
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:03,969
largest portfolio in our program and

107
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:08,019
that's thanks to Andy will develop that

108
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:10,930
portfolio in a very efficient manner so

109
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:12,788
we have a long history especially in

110
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:16,090
South Asia and I think Peter Hobbs is

111
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:19,209
maybe here Peter are you there yeah

112
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:20,799
Peter is there and I think it's one of

113
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:23,288
the pioneer it was involved in

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,360
conservation agriculture and in

115
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:27,519
mechanization word because I mean those

116
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,229
two are very much linked that's one of

117
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,329
the the challenge on conservation

118
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:34,839
agriculture is linked to to

119
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:38,769
mechanization and there was previous to

120
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:40,810
the CRPS there was feral eco regional

121
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:43,689
programs and the rice with consortium

122
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,110
was one and I think was very efficient I

123
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:48,819
mean I joined seam it after that that

124
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,220
program that consortium was was closed

125
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:52,689
but I think it was very very efficient

126
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,789
and that was the one that was the

127
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:57,848
foundation for working in it in South

128
00:05:54,788 --> 00:06:02,379
Asia and we work with if with if free

129
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:05,168
and Olivia and either the the rice

130
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:07,089
research institution so our work on

131
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:09,848
making mechanization is broader than

132
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:11,799
engineering so it's systemic approach to

133
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:14,399
mechanization in fact we don't have many

134
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,400
engineers

135
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,709
potential contribution of mechanization

136
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,560
to sustainable intensification in small

137
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:25,719
girl farming systems the contribution of

138
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,759
mechanization to social inclusion is

139
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,449
also very promising and I show few

140
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,340
slides about about that the effective

141
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,169
ways to scale mechanization is to

142
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:37,029
public/private partnership commerce

143
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:39,788
commercialization creation of business

144
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:42,279
opportunity for service provision and I

145
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:43,839
have few slides about that as well but

146
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,869
we just don't want to be in church we

147
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,819
went with research at the end with an

148
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,978
impact on the ground on the largest

149
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:53,649
number of smaller the farmers possible

150
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:55,629
so there's a strong policy dimension and

151
00:06:53,649 --> 00:07:00,310
I will just show you also a few slides

152
00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:01,899
linked to the policy dimension so where

153
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,000
do we work on mechanization we have a

154
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:05,589
large flagship program in Mexico called

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,408
Mossad room and we have a strong

156
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:10,779
mechanization component there we work

157
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:15,009
with ekkada which is another city center

158
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:18,059
in northern northern Africa on rain-fed

159
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:21,430
weeds systems and the week the we t.o.p

160
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,550
initiative we work in East and Southern

161
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,769
Africa and we have different funding

162
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,949
there with a good funding from the

163
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:32,709
Australian ACR which is the focusing

164
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:35,530
project we are funded by the Germans as

165
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:36,339
well if some interested mechanization

166
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:40,209
does gi8

167
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:44,079
and we are linking with if you on a

168
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:47,319
project in Zambia funded by the European

169
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:49,329
Union so the largest in our program the

170
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,389
largest portfolio is in South Asia is

171
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:55,658
about 50% of our funding and there we

172
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:58,840
work under the sisa portfolio it's a

173
00:07:55,658 --> 00:08:01,569
series of projects all connected under

174
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,549
the we see RP and also under the Borlaug

175
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:06,129
Institute for South Asia which is a

176
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:10,870
structure that was created by Civic to

177
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:16,689
work in India and again a Australian

178
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:18,908
funding on this surface here projects so

179
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:21,399
we have a diversity of geographies where

180
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:24,629
we work very different biophysical but

181
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:26,019
also social socio economic environments

182
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,728
CG Center

183
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:30,279
supposed to work at both the national

184
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:32,319
level or the local level that's the

185
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,899
richness of what we do and that's

186
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,278
probably what we can bring to a national

187
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:38,580
programs because we work a lot with

188
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:41,769
national research programs and

189
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:45,610
development structuring countries so you

190
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:49,360
can imagine that's tree landscapes the

191
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,509
first one is a very very large field the

192
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,509
second one is a very fragmented

193
00:08:51,509 --> 00:09:00,789
landscape in in Bangladesh and the other

194
00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:05,049
one is a landscape in in Kenya so the

195
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:07,778
second one is mostly rice based systems

196
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:09,969
the one in Kenya is made mostly maize

197
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:12,250
based systems so you can imagine that

198
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,259
with such a diversity in field size

199
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,360
mechanization solution might be quite

200
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:18,338
different opportunities and constraints

201
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,389
to adoption of mechanization can be

202
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:25,569
quite different so

203
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:27,459
trying to find scale appropriate tools

204
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:32,969
to work on the different landscape is

205
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:32,969
one of the the objective of our research

206
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:39,789
there was large efforts in pushing

207
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:42,899
mechanization in the seventies eighties

208
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:45,308
in Africa and it was a major failure I

209
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,818
remember when I worked in each year in

210
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:53,919
early 90s I think the average lifespan

211
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:56,588
of a tractor was below and red hours and

212
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,328
that was just state schemes that was

213
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:01,019
funded mostly by the World Bank I

214
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:04,178
believe and it was a complete failure so

215
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:06,459
for a moment I mean the thing is that in

216
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:08,350
the work we do sometimes people judge it

217
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:10,388
doesn't work they don't and they don't

218
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,058
look at why it didn't work it doesn't

219
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:17,259
work so we don't look at it anymore so

220
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:19,298
we had about in Africa about eight nine

221
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:21,188
years ago we wanted just to look at

222
00:10:19,298 --> 00:10:22,568
opportunities for mechanization because

223
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,669
we could see that the adoption of

224
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:27,068
mechanization in South Asia for small

225
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:28,948
oldest farming systems was something

226
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:34,289
very interesting

227
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:36,938
so large-scale mechanization and

228
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:39,099
conservation agriculture one good thing

229
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:41,618
about conservation agriculture is that

230
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,499
you don't need to have primary tillage

231
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:48,220
that means that you can work with less

232
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:51,790
horsepower than smaller tractors that's

233
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,499
the big big advantage we're also looking

234
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:55,058
at mechanization with the minimum

235
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:59,048
negative social and environmental

236
00:10:55,058 --> 00:11:01,088
consequences so in terms of the need for

237
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:02,739
land consolidation if you have large

238
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:04,480
mechanization schemes or the labor

239
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:07,179
displacement and the solar rotation

240
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,839
which is a major focus of our research

241
00:11:07,178 --> 00:11:13,110
as well and our focus on conservation

242
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:17,490
agriculture in our program

243
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:20,940
so machines should adapt adapt to farm

244
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:23,190
size and it seems quite sometimes she

245
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:27,390
still schemes in Africa where people are

246
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:30,150
coming with large tractor I went to John

247
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:32,789
Deere few years ago and close to Chicago

248
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:34,860
and to date course and they didn't like

249
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:36,959
what I was presenting because their

250
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,840
business is to sell the largest tractor

251
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:45,540
possible they don't like conservation

252
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:48,360
agriculture very much so in the context

253
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:50,909
of sustainable intensification we look

254
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,460
at the impact of mechanization on

255
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:56,309
different things the most obvious one is

256
00:11:53,460 --> 00:12:00,180
as labor is the major limiting factor to

257
00:11:56,309 --> 00:12:05,189
productivity of all the systems and at

258
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:08,669
times in in cropping systems for farming

259
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:11,690
systems where labor is really missing

260
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:14,579
and have a negative impact on on yields

261
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:17,190
so you can see two of the publication

262
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,560
from from from our group related to that

263
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,110
and I can give you know the list of

264
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:24,629
publication I've cited it and the

265
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:30,980
presentation will be in this related as

266
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:30,980
well as nothing secret there so

267
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,039
proper

268
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:39,860
Dishman is the most critical time of the

269
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,769
year and that's valid also in South Asia

270
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,959
and irrigated system so it's not only

271
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:47,179
water but what you can see there is a

272
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,359
seven-day difference with maize on the

273
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:53,708
left side maize on the right side seven

274
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:58,759
days delay can have a dramatic effect on

275
00:12:53,708 --> 00:13:02,748
yield so you can see that cloud of of of

276
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:06,019
points and that's for South Asia so a

277
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:08,749
delay in sowing days and impact on wheat

278
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:11,139
yield envy are the reason there is not

279
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:13,639
like in rain fed system it's more like

280
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:17,299
terminal each stress you can have on on

281
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,549
wheat if you plan too late the width in

282
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:21,679
the indo-gangetic Plains there are two

283
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,628
seasons the cold season and a moon soon

284
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,758
the wheat is grown during the Cold

285
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:28,610
season but at the end of the the wheat

286
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,169
cycle temperatures increase so the earth

287
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:37,100
terminal is stressed and having an a

288
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:37,929
large impact from a so crop

289
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,990
established

290
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:42,909
also very demanding and that's and see

291
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:49,330
the work that's done here in Ethiopia

292
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:53,379
with a pair of oxen and that's classical

293
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:57,550
tillage and you can see the amount of of

294
00:13:53,379 --> 00:14:01,990
soul movement done by those ladies in in

295
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:05,319
East Africa so one thing that's

296
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:09,490
important in mechanization planting

297
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,860
seeding and one of the challenge with

298
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:15,220
the equipment for under conservation

299
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,200
agriculture and and-and-and lauch is to

300
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,528
go through the mulch so that's one of

301
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:25,480
the the work we do is trying to find the

302
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:27,549
best or develop the best planters that

303
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,459
can go through the amount of crop

304
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:32,079
residue left on the field and we have

305
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,429
solutions we have four-wheel tractor

306
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,910
solutions we have two we'll practice

307
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:40,989
solutions depending on the and the area

308
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:41,939
where we where we work so that's the

309
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,899
work

310
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:48,130
mechanization some of the labour

311
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:51,419
measures done in in East Africa you can

312
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:54,730
see that the conventional establishment

313
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:57,610
it's requiring quite a lot of hours and

314
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,909
the mechanized she is just much much

315
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,430
reduced so it's a major impact on on

316
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:05,199
labour and that means that you don't

317
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:07,449
have to work two or three weeks to

318
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,250
establish all your fields you can work

319
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:13,450
much faster and then you have an impact

320
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:15,429
on yield as well so that's all the

321
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,879
different operations and the classical

322
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:21,309
time what's taking the the most time is

323
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:27,899
the Easter planting so you have the

324
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:27,899
manual and you have mechanised

325
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:31,559
mechanization

326
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,660
and war

327
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:36,438
water is also an important input in most

328
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:40,259
on all the farming systems where we work

329
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:43,379
major impact has been done on working on

330
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:46,589
laser land leveling in in India over the

331
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:52,920
last 20 years I think Peter when when

332
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:55,199
they did start the land it is a so of

333
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,328
course Asim it we didn't create the

334
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:00,409
technology laser land levelling was

335
00:15:57,328 --> 00:16:03,958
existing and was using and us quite

336
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:05,969
intensively in places like like Utah but

337
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:09,299
we worked with national partners and we

338
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:12,300
developed you know schemes for rail and

339
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:14,938
leveling having a major impact on on

340
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:18,028
water management in in those systems so

341
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:21,870
I think right now in India thing was bad

342
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:24,838
six million a tropism they've been laser

343
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:27,028
land level and of course time to time

344
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,249
you need to do to be level your your

345
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:32,879
field so there's a good business around

346
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:34,860
around that we are working more on

347
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:38,339
technology of tomorrow I mean we're just

348
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:41,278
developing some doing some research on

349
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:43,980
subsurface drip irrigation and we get

350
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:47,870
fantastic weather use efficiency systems

351
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:51,269
plus the option of control much better

352
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:54,240
fertilizer inputs true fertigation so we

353
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:57,509
have some some some work there the the

354
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,000
slide on the bottom left is about actual

355
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:03,089
flow pumps that can be paired with the

356
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,009
pto of of a two wheel tractor so that

357
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,110
means that if you don't have too much of

358
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:09,750
course that struction those you can your

359
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:12,029
lift cannot be done that that large but

360
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,189
in bangladesh you can usually find you

361
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:16,879
know open water and bring it to your

362
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:20,009
fields so that's also a very interesting

363
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,059
option for for farmers for supplemental

364
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:26,129
irrigation and we have mechanized also

365
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:29,190
and as a prototype has been developed at

366
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:32,100
the visa station to lay down drip lines

367
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:34,110
under the surface the good thing was

368
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:36,359
minimum tillage so reduce tillage or no

369
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:38,009
tillage is that you can put your lines

370
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,609
down and you don't need to remove them

371
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:41,839
at the end of the season so it's

372
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:43,639
if you don't have too much rodents

373
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,029
around you can probably keep your lines

374
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,860
through years

375
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:51,079
so impact at scale that's the the

376
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:55,219
figures I was talking about on laser

377
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:59,119
leveling so yes now four thousand forty

378
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:01,308
thousand units in India and was mainly

379
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:05,959
done through private investment and

380
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:10,480
service provision so that's that can be

381
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:12,919
you know a good model for developing and

382
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,789
scaling mechanization in other parts of

383
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:20,000
the world as well so you can see all the

384
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:23,349
figures just impact on on you know water

385
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,619
management water savings on yields on

386
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:31,099
employment on electricity savings one of

387
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:33,859
the issue yes that water is subsidized I

388
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:37,279
mean pumping is not cost electricity

389
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:39,319
subsidized for pumping so it's a bit of

390
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,759
a problem when you want to incent and

391
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:44,149
certify things that are free I just

392
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:46,279
usually abused so there are some some

393
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:51,100
also some research and linking that to a

394
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:53,509
policy the policy component

395
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:56,589
mechanization and nutrient use plan

396
00:18:53,509 --> 00:19:03,140
nutrition plan nutrient juice so

397
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:05,808
mechanization is obviously improving to

398
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:09,559
directly to of the for our principles

399
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:14,119
the right rate I mean if you if you have

400
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:18,849
fertilizer application with with your

401
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:22,279
planter or your direct print cedar and

402
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:25,969
the right place as well so place and

403
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:28,160
rate and you increase profitability and

404
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,529
you reduce also winners gas emissions

405
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,960
and nitrate teaching which is a major

406
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:36,539
problem in many systems were working

407
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,779
with social include

408
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:43,500
that's those are data from from our

409
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:48,289
project in in Africa Eastern southern

410
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:50,990
Africa and that shows over the year the

411
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:53,069
access to mechanization and we are just

412
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,170
monitoring I mean it's very important

413
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:56,849
now our donors are not interested in

414
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,039
publications most of the time they're

415
00:19:56,849 --> 00:20:01,619
interested in actually you can generate

416
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:05,210
either directly or indirectly so that's

417
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:07,079
part of the monitoring we have done

418
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,630
mechanization in in in Africa

419
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:12,869
sub-saharan Africa is still a big big

420
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:18,510
challenge for many reasons but we want

421
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:20,849
to continue to work on that so on the

422
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:22,680
the equity issue was access to

423
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:24,839
mechanization it's also a very important

424
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,519
question and and you look at the

425
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,659
investment costs for a large structure

426
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:33,170
and you look at the investment costs for

427
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:36,630
you know the animal attraction and

428
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:38,700
two-wheel tractors the problem was with

429
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,580
animal attraction is that you usually

430
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,319
use your animals for one two three weeks

431
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:47,099
during the year and the rest of the year

432
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:50,099
you have to feed those animals with prop

433
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:52,049
residues and feet so one of the issue of

434
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,369
conservation agriculture adoption in

435
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:57,359
Africa is also the trade-off between

436
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:59,489
preferences you use so going to a

437
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,559
mechanized option a fully mechanized

438
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,549
option and not going through animal

439
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:07,319
traction is probably much more promising

440
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:10,529
although I mean animal traction might

441
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:13,559
look very romantic but it's not the best

442
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:19,700
use of resources in small other farming

443
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:19,700
systems so again

444
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:26,800
cost when you go from conventional

445
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:28,569
practices with four-wheel tractors to

446
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,149
two-wheel tractors conservation

447
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:33,099
agriculture the cost is much much lower

448
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:35,910
and you have again in the middle of the

449
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:38,559
cost of animal traction when you have to

450
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:42,009
you know take care of your of your

451
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:47,019
animals during between between two two

452
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:51,660
seasons youth I mean it was a big topic

453
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:55,450
in in in the CG few years ago how can we

454
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:58,480
make agriculture attractive for young

455
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:00,250
people in developing countries I think

456
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,950
we have all the same the same problem I

457
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,109
think agriculture is not very sexy in

458
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:08,350
Europe it's not very sexy in the US but

459
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:11,319
we had a lot of consolidation in

460
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:13,959
developing countries in many places

461
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,269
that's the only livelihood option for

462
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,410
four people and you have a lot of

463
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:21,819
migrations to cities and so on so

464
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:25,509
population is often aging very very

465
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:28,779
quickly in in small systems in Asia and

466
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:32,740
in Africa so that's an example where you

467
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:38,589
had you know mesh error which in one

468
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:40,509
season generated 6700 borers which from

469
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:42,909
our standard might not look very big but

470
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:45,579
it's very very big enough in large

471
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,860
amount of money so we are looking also

472
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:50,399
and you know on those service provision

473
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:53,409
and how much how long it takes to return

474
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:58,540
year to 12 the return on investment and

475
00:22:53,410 --> 00:23:03,490
usually it's quite quite short gender

476
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:07,819
impact that's a very very simple Scherer

477
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:10,220
again but this was you

478
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:13,460
reduction in labor demand and bursaries

479
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:20,660
for that it went from 12 days per ton to

480
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:24,710
one hour so it's this is Africa this is

481
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:26,330
the work in in in Bangladesh and again

482
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,309
we are monitoring and we are looking at

483
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:33,159
the impact of mechanization on on

484
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:36,230
different important lively components

485
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:39,769
child care activities cooking our farm

486
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:42,620
laborer livestock poultry income

487
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:44,329
generation so the time you free on your

488
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:46,039
operations - mechanization you can

489
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:49,699
invest it in income generating

490
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:53,000
activities Arvest incurring threshing

491
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,650
have to manage form labourers time spent

492
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,960
spend on later in leisure

493
00:23:54,650 --> 00:24:00,320
I mean life in small farms in developing

494
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:04,160
countries can be tough this is something

495
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:06,649
that's very I think profitable for

496
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,740
people as well a mess linked to the drug

497
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:12,410
Treasury and and it's there is a strong

498
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:15,700
gender dimension to that as well usually

499
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:20,090
women were much more many more hours in

500
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:24,080
rural landscapes in Africa in Asia than

501
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:26,720
men time sleeping as well I mean

502
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,789
sleeping it's important so it's an

503
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,620
interesting study showing the you know

504
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:34,970
just the implication of of one

505
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:39,709
mechanization option which is the Reaper

506
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:42,140
of Esther so how do we scale that I mean

507
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,930
it's the question is that in Asia is

508
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,940
already a large adoption of

509
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:49,759
mechanization options in Africa it's

510
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,440
just at the beginning so we are looking

511
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,650
at model to scale out appropriate

512
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,820
organization and one key thing is

513
00:24:54,650 --> 00:25:00,340
service provision commercialization so

514
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:03,079
professionalization of the activity I

515
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:04,909
don't we don't dream about every farmer

516
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:07,250
having a small two-wheel tractors I

517
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:09,870
think the service provision is much more

518
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:13,049
efficient so

519
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:16,319
that's the classical adoption technology

520
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:20,669
adoption curve and I would say that in

521
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:23,069
Africa we are about there I think in

522
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:25,440
some places in in in Asia we are still

523
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:27,029
we are there and the research questions

524
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,250
are still very interesting even with

525
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:33,089
adoption at scale that's very

526
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:35,970
interesting aspect so being able to work

527
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:38,639
under that adoption technology adoption

528
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:42,120
continuum is also very interesting for

529
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:46,740
us and learning also from what we do in

530
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:48,599
Asia for the future in Africa that's one

531
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,740
of the project we have in in Bangladesh

532
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:56,279
and that shows the growth since the

533
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:59,519
beginning of the project on machinery

534
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:01,349
service provision so again that's part

535
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,990
of the monitoring and evaluation that's

536
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:06,299
the USAID that's the US funded project

537
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:12,089
USAID and very important that we

538
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:15,000
document also so those are the

539
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:17,099
achievement after the phase one of the

540
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,799
project and we are now going into a

541
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:23,129
phase two which is a bit different and

542
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:26,759
it's been redesigned but those are not

543
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:29,220
small numbers large numbers and I mean

544
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:31,109
we are pretty proud of that so we are

545
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,589
not a pure research institution we have

546
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:39,089
at the end working for impacts on on the

547
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:40,799
ground so a lot of work has been done in

548
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:44,789
Bangladesh and in other places as well

549
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:49,379
to look at at the best business models

550
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:54,539
for scaling mechanization increasing

551
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:56,790
adoption of mechanization options and we

552
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:59,940
even a scaling specialist now in Simmons

553
00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:02,879
we call it like that looking among other

554
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:09,180
things at mechanization options in

555
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:12,240
different systems so that's a slide

556
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:16,380
where you see a my favorite US president

557
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:21,660
from the left side and that guy is jail

558
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:23,640
Oliver is a kind of innovator and here's

559
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,400
Ronald rats so you know went very well

560
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,290
and we are trying to work with him so

561
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,790
it's you know digital agriculture

562
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:32,399
there's also options on service

563
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:36,029
provision cell phones and so on so it's

564
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:39,390
very exciting type of work it calls it

565
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:41,460
uber for tractors and that's also a

566
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:44,810
great tool to monitor you know the work

567
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,549
of equipments in the field and so on

568
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:50,940
Indians if they own system which is very

569
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:53,490
similar and there are some manufacturers

570
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,549
now that you know working on the the

571
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:58,920
scaling of monitoring systems and and

572
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:04,889
service provision and comment systems

573
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:08,700
for for for FAO is a big player does the

574
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:10,560
new new director general of FAO we

575
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,710
visited us before being elected

576
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,470
it was campaigning in Mexico so we have

577
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,630
discussing China is an interesting

578
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,390
country because the progress this

579
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,730
probably the country with the largest

580
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:25,650
number of manufacturers of two-wheel

581
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:29,460
tractors more implements and so on so

582
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:31,200
it's a great place to go and shop so the

583
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,120
business models we are looking we're of

584
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,620
course looking at service provision but

585
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,529
it's not good enough I mean you need to

586
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:39,419
create the market you need to create

587
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:42,329
import schemes you need to train people

588
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:46,110
in local workshops to you know develop

589
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:49,319
and/or repair the equipment so it's a an

590
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:52,159
FAO is well implemented in that in that

591
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:56,149
regard so working with a few in

592
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,150
mechanization makes a lot of sense

593
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,319
information knowledge communication is

594
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,180
also very important my thing we have

595
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:06,419
done quite interesting videos especially

596
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,730
in in South Asia I guess how many videos

597
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,659
do we have and the ability

598
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:14,649
quite a few no yeah so and we have her

599
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:20,720
briefs and we have a lot of things

600
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:23,089
capacity development and we have we are

601
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,600
running conservation agriculture

602
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:29,480
training courses at least once a year in

603
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:34,849
in Mexico and once a year in in South

604
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:37,759
Asia so it's also very important to to

605
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:43,879
enhance you know capabilities in

606
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:49,908
different countries were working work so

607
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:51,860
I was I was teased by by by the top

608
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:53,809
management of Simeon they say you work

609
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:56,240
you do interesting work in mechanization

610
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:58,129
and it's not visible and sometimes

611
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,710
people don't don't see what they don't

612
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:03,679
want to see but so we have we've done a

613
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:07,220
specific efforts in in trying to to

614
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,870
brand our work for different reasons I

615
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,700
mean for people being interested by the

616
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:13,158
topic from all the research or

617
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,460
development organizations for

618
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:18,980
fundraising I mean we work only on soft

619
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,460
soft funding so we have to raise money

620
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:24,860
for for the work we want to do but

621
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,288
there's been a lot of tweets and

622
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:29,658
discussion when we are using Twitter we

623
00:30:27,288 --> 00:30:34,879
are using Facebook using different

624
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:37,010
different one interesting aspects

625
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,230
related to mechanization is and you

626
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:43,240
probably heard about the air pollution

627
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:46,460
problem in Northwest India in Delhi

628
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,380
which is not only due to crop residue

629
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,659
burning but crop residue burning is

630
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,200
adding a layer of pollution at the time

631
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:58,278
of Christ's harvesting which is in

632
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:00,139
November and rice residues are burned

633
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:02,419
not because farmers like to burn things

634
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:04,839
it's because they have to prepare the

635
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:08,570
land for the for the the wheats

636
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:11,480
subsequent weeks wheat crop so the time

637
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:13,638
the time is not that big and that's the

638
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,259
first one of the first light I show that

639
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:18,199
the penalty begin penalty you have on

640
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:20,140
wheat by delaying your wheat planting so

641
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,090
the easiest way to get rid of crop

642
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,340
you is just to burn it so we've been

643
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:26,049
looking for a long time I think Peter

644
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:29,049
the first version of the a PC there was

645
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:35,169
developed one it was Australian funding

646
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:41,049
yeah initially black black well yeah and

647
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:43,300
that was in so the thing is also that's

648
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:45,789
the message you know long-term

649
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:47,919
investment pay I mean some donors like

650
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:49,359
after getting very impatient right the

651
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,190
project in three years you have to wait

652
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,569
for four years you have to have impact

653
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:55,350
that scale doesn't work like that

654
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:58,059
I think sustained investment and

655
00:31:55,349 --> 00:32:02,289
coherence in what what you do over the

656
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:05,289
long term is very important so I'll just

657
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:08,920
show you that's that's a combine

658
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:13,480
harvester our resting the rice on the

659
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:16,810
left side and directly planting the the

660
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:21,759
wheat just after harvesting the rice so

661
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:25,599
it's just fantastic so you can see the

662
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:27,910
amount of residue you have and oddly a

663
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:30,339
PC door is working what you can see

664
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:32,640
there also that's added to the the

665
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:34,869
combine harvester it's a straw

666
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,880
management system which is fretting was

667
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:39,369
true more evenly but you don't have

668
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:47,070
piles of straw and that's your your your

669
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:50,349
cedar works better another paper

670
00:32:47,069 --> 00:32:52,329
interesting paper was trying to show a

671
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:54,699
nice one the policy issues showing the

672
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:59,079
trade-off that you can have on on

673
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:02,490
different things in in a system so the

674
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:05,589
effect of and I think that was in 2008

675
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,269
Water Act was taken in fact to save

676
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:12,939
water

677
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:14,619
they just delay the planting dates for

678
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,130
the authorized planting dates for rice

679
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:20,589
and that of course at the major impact

680
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:22,450
on the way farmers had to manage their

681
00:33:20,589 --> 00:33:24,399
residue they didn't have much time so

682
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,289
this paper is quite interesting because

683
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,080
showing in fact the difference that you

684
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:31,899
have in term of crop residue burning and

685
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:34,619
air pollution before the Water Act and

686
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,620
after the water

687
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:44,810
and of course and these one of the lead

688
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:48,390
author of that that publication so

689
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:50,039
health issues taken seriously in India

690
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:53,130
as well so I think it's if you look in

691
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:57,869
the news both national and international

692
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:59,880
news crop residue burning is is a

693
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,309
burning issue in in South Asian

694
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,850
especially in India and you could see

695
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:08,849
that the quick scaling of a p-series

696
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:13,199
in two states of India Northwest India

697
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:16,259
Punjab in and Arianna between 2010 to

698
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:19,139
2018 and of course there were subsidies

699
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:23,850
to manufacturers and to service from

700
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:26,009
providers to purchase the equipment so

701
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:27,509
it's not always you know without

702
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,340
subsidies wouldn't have been possible

703
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,020
because the EPI cedar is quite an

704
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,769
expensive piece of equipment equipment

705
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:38,759
and it's just used to three weeks a year

706
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:40,440
so that's so not right now what we are

707
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,810
doing we are monitoring and and they

708
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,619
still working on those topics were

709
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:51,469
monitoring in fact the evolution of

710
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:51,469
Prophecy burning in that in that region

711
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:58,609
so the way forward for us I think we

712
00:34:56,809 --> 00:35:00,710
have increased a visibility of our work

713
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,539
I mean again visibly it is important if

714
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:06,409
you want to sustain and continue it

715
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:09,619
where funding for that type of work the

716
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:11,809
scaling work as well I think our role

717
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:13,730
has been a knowledge broker through

718
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:18,349
systemic approach we are not just

719
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:19,960
narrowly looking at engineering we want

720
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:22,489
to keep strong linkages between

721
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:25,070
mechanization and more sustainable

722
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:26,239
agricultural practices and it's it's a

723
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,620
natural match if you look at

724
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:31,789
conservation agricultural mechanization

725
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:33,799
say it's a natural match we want to

726
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:35,779
enhance general youth relevant technical

727
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,330
innovations and the scaling and that's

728
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:42,019
not only for field operation it's also

729
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:43,730
post harvest and transport we want to

730
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:45,829
explore new regions I think we have been

731
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,719
discussing with well in West Africa was

732
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:51,259
with Benin was the Minister of

733
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:53,209
Agriculture strong interest from one day

734
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:56,120
as well where the mechanization program

735
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:58,519
developed in that country Southeast Asia

736
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,799
we are not very present in Southeast

737
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:03,079
Asia we are almost absent in Southeast

738
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,530
Asia and we are looking at opportunities

739
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,239
to work there as well and we want to

740
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,390
develop also South as collaboration

741
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:14,859
China Africa India Africa and

742
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:14,859
public/private partnership approaches

743
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:22,369
India as fantastic engineers in in input

744
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:27,319
job and I think I can really surf Africa

745
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:29,210
so it could be win-win solutions options

746
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,360
in terms of business development in

747
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:33,320
terms of benefits for smaller farmers in

748
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,480
Africa

749
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,780
so then we want to keep our key

750
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:42,889
collaborations what further with a few

751
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:44,360
and the gi8 mechanisation platform so

752
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:45,920
right now in the CG where we're

753
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,269
reinventing ourselves and we are

754
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,150
wondering whether we should have an

755
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:53,719
initiative on mechanization or not it's

756
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:56,630
not yet proposed I think but it could be

757
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:58,909
something where I think all city centers

758
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:01,640
would be interested in working on a

759
00:36:58,909 --> 00:37:03,089
systemic approach to to make -

760
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:15,000
mechanization

761
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:30,240
so thank you well I didn't money to at

762
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:33,210
the time I was not a little bit early to

763
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,669
ask you if you are a small boat without

764
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:38,820
a lot of resources how do you actually

765
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:43,170
access some of this mechanization what's

766
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,940
the actual or well there are places

767
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,889
where there's no access yet

768
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,400
I think it's developed developing

769
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:54,299
business models which would involve

770
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:57,000
probably financial financial schemes

771
00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:01,500
would involve public and private sector

772
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,420
so in India is flying I mean it's it's

773
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,550
not that difficult in Bangladesh is a

774
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,610
lot of momentum around that as well in

775
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:12,450
Africa we have to prime the pump because

776
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:16,920
there's nothing and so our research in

777
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:19,829
the FATA C project was just to was more

778
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,230
discovery face on mechanization options

779
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:23,730
using two-wheel tractors and we see I

780
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:28,349
mean you have seen the figures in terms

781
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:30,119
of cost timing yields maze it's a

782
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:32,159
no-brainer when you see that but now the

783
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:35,940
challenge is to build an ecosystem

784
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:38,359
around mechanization and I think that's

785
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:41,909
what we I mean that's what we want to do

786
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:43,680
because new research questions will

787
00:38:41,909 --> 00:38:46,829
emerge when you start having adoption of

788
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:49,409
those technologies another thing is and

789
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:52,409
I didn't present it a year but it's the

790
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:54,029
targeting you know what what are the

791
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:56,519
low-hanging fruits when it comes to

792
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:58,080
where to put mechanization where to

793
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:00,329
start it we need to initiate that

794
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,909
somewhere and it's not in the middle of

795
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:06,420
the bush for committee to city issues

796
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:09,929
from it's important having farmers were

797
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:13,019
more aware of you know more eager to

798
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:15,750
make a nice also

799
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:17,759
so as range of criteria on the way we

800
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:20,219
should we should start and we are

801
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,930
looking for you know performance support

802
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:24,480
as well in doing that so we are not

803
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:26,159
working alone we work with advanced

804
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,460
research institution but also with

805
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:32,579
national research organizations NGOs in

806
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:36,539
some cases in in Bangladesh we work with

807
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:40,500
quite a lot with idea so so there's no

808
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:43,829
not an easy option for for that but I

809
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:46,800
think it's it's really context specific

810
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:49,019
and now you want to how we can scale

811
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:56,070
that but we don't have impact at scale

812
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:59,869
in Africa yet but we want where it is

813
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:03,059
the model more performers themselves to

814
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:07,590
mechanize or is the model more for a

815
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:09,179
custom that is a sector that provides a

816
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,280
mechanization you shall do laser

817
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:13,349
leveling which obviously has to be on

818
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,690
the commercial sector but I'm also

819
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:17,069
thinking of planting and harvesting even

820
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:19,740
in the United States there's a lot of

821
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,859
custom custom plowing custom harvesting

822
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:23,699
though even with farmers with a lot of

823
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:26,969
possibility they could invest but

824
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:30,269
instead it's more efficient for a sector

825
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:32,730
to arise and so where is your your

826
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:35,070
emphasis there are those are both models

827
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:37,380
that you think would apply in different

828
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:39,570
countries we have for service provision

829
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,640
and in most cases those are farmers

830
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:44,789
becoming service providers I mean we saw

831
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:46,618
that in Europe as well yes no point in

832
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:49,289
buying a large combine harvester if you

833
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:51,450
have 50 acres of wheat I mean it doesn't

834
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:54,019
make sense and for most systems it's

835
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:57,779
like that as well so we are trying to

836
00:40:54,019 --> 00:41:00,420
you know provide incentives or you know

837
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:03,480
and knowledge for investment in term of

838
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:06,960
service provision so you saw that youth

839
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,760
group they are really youth and they

840
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,019
just invested in the the thing they will

841
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,300
probably help in buying mesh error but

842
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:17,429
they paid it back very very quickly so

843
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,710
it's those type of things you know

844
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:21,519
positive variance in the way working

845
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,409
landscape will

846
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,239
incentive i order but you need a

847
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:29,289
critical mass I mean you cannot just if

848
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:31,118
one you know mechanize service provider

849
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:34,300
somewhere because that guy will not be

850
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,240
you know welding to get equipment will

851
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:39,910
not be welding to get repairs and things

852
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:43,659
that so it's a full system that we need

853
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:46,599
to develop and I believe that the you

854
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:48,429
know learning from from South Asia India

855
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:51,219
but also Bangladesh waveforms are much

856
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:53,559
more than even in Africa can be very

857
00:41:51,219 --> 00:42:22,629
useful for for developing schemes for

858
00:41:53,559 --> 00:42:24,670
poor for free thank you yes over here no

859
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,440
no no I I work for the livestock

860
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,690
Research Institute before I don't say

861
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,710
get rid of the livestock don't use

862
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:34,389
livestock for for powering your

863
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,699
operations in a farm because usually

864
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:39,699
those are you know in Ethiopia for

865
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:43,389
example pair of oxen they are not used

866
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:46,239
for milk production when at the end of

867
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:48,309
the life and maybe a bit of meat but

868
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,709
they are eating a lot fun non-productive

869
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:53,259
function except operations in the field

870
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:57,690
so if you look at the economics it's

871
00:42:53,260 --> 00:43:00,910
better to invest in dairy cattle than in

872
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:05,220
cattle for for animal traction so that's

873
00:43:00,909 --> 00:43:05,219
my point I don't say the get rid of the

874
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:20,710
yeah yeah well that's but you could

875
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:22,779
still have livestock but not to do your

876
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:25,000
traction you feed them to produce milk

877
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:29,519
which is a much more rewarding way of

878
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,519
looking at thing yes

879
00:43:33,608 --> 00:43:40,409
we have projects in Mexico which is

880
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:43,149
North America we have worked in in

881
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:44,769
Guatemala quite a bit on milpa systems

882
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:47,320
on hills

883
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:49,780
so it's mechanization was not a top

884
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,730
priority there because those are complex

885
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:58,060
you know farming systems mill pallets

886
00:43:51,730 --> 00:44:00,280
several species sloppy fields so erosion

887
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:02,409
problems but I think very few

888
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,200
opportunities for mechanization in goes

889
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:06,849
in those systems and further south we

890
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,559
don't have funding to work in the most

891
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:10,239
Latin American countries I think it's

892
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,429
you know the fundings also the thing

893
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:15,159
that's driving us where we work you know

894
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:20,440
what's our presence of maize or wheat in

895
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:22,389
systems and then the funding we can yes

896
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,090
oh yeah there was a question there for a

897
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:29,579
long time yeah sorry I actually read a

898
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:32,530
couple of adaptation or adoption

899
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:35,199
adoption of two-wheel tractors and and

900
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:37,330
you gave a couple of good examples of

901
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:41,289
this or where I'm going one is the corn

902
00:44:37,329 --> 00:44:44,619
sheller and one is what other idea I

903
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:47,289
mean from this adoption perspective what

904
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:48,608
other ideas are you following up whether

905
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:51,489
directions that you're coming up with

906
00:44:48,608 --> 00:44:54,730
that these two-wheel tractors can be

907
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:57,939
used for Co uses but are not directly

908
00:44:54,730 --> 00:45:01,480
tillage type of you know those those

909
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:03,369
would be transports transport transport

910
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,829
is a big problem and if you look at

911
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:08,170
market distribution in Africa usually

912
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:10,779
people have to walk a lot to access

913
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:13,539
markets both for inputs but also for the

914
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:15,960
products they want to sell so you know

915
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:19,150
tool tractor we serve these are trailers

916
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:22,150
it's much better than using a donkey or

917
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:24,010
even using your your back to transport

918
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:27,090
things so transport is the thing we are

919
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:27,090
really looking at as well

920
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:34,290
so any question about the integration of

921
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:37,250
organization like how available is fuel

922
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:39,380
and when you're thinking about actually

923
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:48,030
thinking about the design and

924
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:51,269
inspiration for the context fuel let's

925
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:53,130
feel free I know what you have to build

926
00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:55,980
those systems I mean again I mean in

927
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:57,480
India is not a problem in Bangladesh is

928
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:00,090
not a problem but if you're in the

929
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,030
middle of nowhere in landscape in Kenya

930
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:05,160
Tanzania or simbad way you have to

931
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,840
develop those those surfaces as well so

932
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:11,849
it's a it's a full ecosystem when you

933
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:14,789
look at and with the the data we we have

934
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:16,259
we believe that it's worth investing for

935
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:19,469
governments to invest in in

936
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:22,740
mechanization in the country so that's

937
00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:24,329
and that would be you know not I would

938
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:26,368
say that would be national investment

939
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:30,900
for that so that's the type of you know

940
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:32,970
pledge or Clee we do when we we discuss

941
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,690
with national research programs and

942
00:46:32,969 --> 00:46:38,399
governments on mechanization and that's

943
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:40,559
the the requesting one that came for the

944
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,240
Minister of Agriculture and she said we

945
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,329
won't submit to be involved in

946
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:49,919
mechanization and we want to be what in

947
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:52,079
our country a chip is very receptive the

948
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,659
only problem is that sometimes people

949
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,599
are just want to take shortcuts and take

950
00:46:54,659 --> 00:47:01,699
the very simplistic approach the resume

951
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:04,349
mechanization to just buying equipment

952
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:06,689
if you buy equipment you'll go back to

953
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:08,699
the the World Bank investment in the 80s

954
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:12,450
where you just get the thing not use and

955
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:16,019
destroy in few months so unless you have

956
00:47:12,449 --> 00:47:19,559
trained people you have workshops we

957
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:21,090
have retailers you have you have the

958
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:23,099
support in term of fuel and so on

959
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:24,300
there's no point in investing that's not

960
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:26,219
the first step the first step is not

961
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,170
buying the equipment that's the easiest

962
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,879
thing to do that's probably the thing

963
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:34,858
that will not work if it's done in

964
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:36,420
isolation of the to the rest are you

965
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:40,049
seeing any opportunities for

966
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:42,530
electrification so all local solar power

967
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:45,240
battery

968
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:47,550
yeah we can I mean we have not look at

969
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:49,679
that and in particular but I think there

970
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:53,220
are programs in in India for example

971
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:55,649
looking at you know the the energy

972
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:56,759
approaching in farming systems and of

973
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:00,599
course it's something very very

974
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:04,260
attractive yes that could be parts I

975
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:06,510
mean if you look at mechanization under

976
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,760
that umbrella you can put a lot of a lot

977
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:11,790
of things linked to energy use in in

978
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:25,920
rural systems as well so energy

979
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:28,320
production energy so it's this has been

980
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:33,200
a production of Cornell University on

981
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,200
the web at Cornell edu
