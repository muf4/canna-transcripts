1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,770
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,769
University

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,490
they're so

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:15,269
yeah my title today is a time for barley

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,278
to go naked after 10,000 years and if

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,079
there was a subtitle to this

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,839
presentation it would be the conclusion

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:24,570
of another man after a life with barley

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,939
and that is because I have spent the

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,359
last thirty years my professional life

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,919
working on barley and there is a book a

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,839
real book out there this is not

13
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:36,420
Photoshop called one man's life with

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,730
barley and it is a much better book than

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,950
anything I could write and it's by Harry

16
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:42,839
Harlan and he was one of the pioneering

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,020
plant explorers and traveled the world

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,450
and was responsible for I think a lot of

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,280
the vision that we have for conservation

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,219
of plant genetics resources and so if

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,840
you have a chance to get a copy of one

22
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,049
man's life with barley I'd encourage you

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,000
to go there let me do sect the title a

24
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,729
little bit here it wasn't intended to be

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,819
at all you know sort of the kind of

26
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:08,399
thing to bring people out after lunch

27
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:10,139
but first let's just do barley and in

28
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:11,909
what's barley for those of you not

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,609
familiar with it it is hordeum vulgare

30
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,830
subspecies vulgare you will see it often

31
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:19,799
referred to as just hordeum vulgare but

32
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:21,780
technically we should use the subspecies

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,489
because it is completely inter fertile

34
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,549
with its wild ancestor which is

35
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:28,769
subspecies spot Nahum it's a diploid has

36
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,740
a large genome size has that sort of

37
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:34,199
average number of genes and it is a

38
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,329
hermaphrodite and so this is kind of

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,909
all-important in the breeding and

40
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,590
genetics and so forth of this organism

41
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,260
because it's highly tolerant of

42
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,390
inbreeding and as a consequence we see

43
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,900
primarily pure line varieties throughout

44
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,210
the world there have been kind of on and

45
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,920
off attempts at hybrid production in

46
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:55,500
barley and those really haven't caught

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,900
on until recently Syngenta's been

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,560
marketing some hybrid feed Barley's in

49
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,359
europe with some considerable success

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,430
there is still public and private plant

51
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,530
breeding in the Americas and so my

52
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,509
colleague Mark Sorrels and students on

53
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,128
his project are still barley breeders

54
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:14,279
and wheat breeders and so forth at

55
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:16,259
universities we have had a much greater

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,609
presence of the private sector in

57
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:20,079
cereals breeding in the last several

58
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:23,409
years here in the Americas in the rest

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,900
of the world really then it's a private

60
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:28,509
venture and so barley and wheat have

61
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,120
long since gone down the road that we've

62
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:33,870
seen in the US with corn and soybeans

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,879
and other crops

64
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,640
so let me get to the naked part of the

65
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,519
title here and the naked in this case

66
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:45,669
refers to the adherence of the lemma in

67
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:49,840
Pylea to the Kari OPS's to the seed and

68
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:52,539
so if they adhere then you have what is

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,969
called a covered barley and if they

70
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:57,729
don't adhere they're not adhering you

71
00:02:54,969 --> 00:03:00,069
have what we'll call a naked barley and

72
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:02,079
I'm gonna use this naked nomenclature

73
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:03,909
after Takeda at all here who are the

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,690
ones who cloned this gene and then

75
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:10,030
reported in 2008 because by saying naked

76
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:13,210
and covered you just get around this

77
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:16,270
real messy kind of grammatical semantic

78
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:18,820
thing because if you want to say that a

79
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:23,020
barley doesn't have a halt is it

80
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:25,750
hull-less with a - is it Hollis with

81
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,790
just two L's and it's just and it's

82
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,310
complicated and further complicated by

83
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:32,739
the fact that if that's Hollis then what

84
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,810
is the alternative and its hold which

85
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,450
can be misconstrued to sound as though

86
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,520
it has had its whole removed so it's

87
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:42,000
just easier to say covered and naked I

88
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:46,330
think so hence the terms

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,509
the gene abbreviation is nude for new

90
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,870
demand the covered form right here where

91
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:54,789
we have the adhering lemma and palea is

92
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:58,509
dominance and it is indeed the wild and

93
00:03:54,789 --> 00:04:01,479
ancestral condition and when Takeda and

94
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:03,849
his group cloned this they identified

95
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:06,459
this as an ethylene response factor it's

96
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:10,150
a transcription factor and the mechanism

97
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:12,460
by which it works is that there is or is

98
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,400
not the formation of a lipid layer

99
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,150
between the lemma and palea in the

100
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,649
pericarp and if the lipid forms then the

101
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,259
lemon peleas sticks and if the layer

102
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,729
doesn't form then it thrush is clean so

103
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:27,939
for you folks who are familiar with

104
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:30,400
wheat and other grains that thrush clean

105
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:32,430
this is like no surprise it's sort of

106
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,989
like well why not

107
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:38,370
we thought all grains were that way

108
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:40,680
barley is rather unique in being a major

109
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,050
cereal crop of the fourth most important

110
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,478
in the world that actually has a tightly

111
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,460
adhering halt and so we'll kind of see

112
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,490
some of the reasons why that has

113
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:52,859
transpired

114
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:56,100
so now to the ten thousand year part of

115
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,439
the title here so barley originated as

116
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,050
din so many of our other crops and

117
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,228
domesticated animals in the Fertile

118
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,720
Crescent and then you saw a

119
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:08,300
dispersal of barley from that ancestral

120
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,630
site

121
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:15,090
and there's a couple of key traits that

122
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:18,659
are part of that domestication syndrome

123
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:21,719
and the naked covered phenotype is is

124
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,300
one of them so certainly shattering or

125
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,590
the brittle rei'kas is

126
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,020
characteristic of the subspecies font

127
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:29,519
name and that's that condition have a

128
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:31,889
picture of it in the next slide here

129
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,149
that just facilitates seed dispersal and

130
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,400
so you definitely want the non

131
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:38,370
shattering non brittle rei'kas in bulk

132
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:40,259
are the domesticated sort spot name is a

133
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,930
two row for those of you not familiar

134
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,819
with Barley's two row means you have a

135
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,800
single row of kernels on either side of

136
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:48,930
the spike and so that's a fertile

137
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,418
florida at every rekha snowed and if

138
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,728
you're a six row then you have three so

139
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:57,779
the ancestral form is two and the post

140
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:59,699
domestication form is six the spot name

141
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:01,109
the ancestral sort has an adhering halt

142
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,960
I said that was a wild type that

143
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,629
dominant allele and there are adhering

144
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,329
and non adhering halls within volgar and

145
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:11,129
in terms of growth habit something we

146
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:14,579
really won't get into today but that is

147
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:17,639
very near and dear to my heart then you

148
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:20,819
have just winter annuals in the hordeum

149
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,280
spontaneity have winter facultative and

150
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:25,319
spring annual types present in the

151
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,348
derive so that of course gives us this

152
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,779
kind of apparent situation and we all

153
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:32,848
know that appearances can be deceiving

154
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:35,519
that'll be my only political illusion

155
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:38,250
today but one of them is it seems that

156
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,799
we have much greater diversity over here

157
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,509
in volgar than we do in the spot name

158
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,150
but in fact of course it's quite the

159
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:47,370
reverse because we had a number of

160
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:49,679
evolutionary bottlenecks along the way

161
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,780
where we've lost allelic diversity in

162
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,848
vulgare and so that is a very active

163
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:57,929
averse area of research is to go back

164
00:06:53,848 --> 00:07:00,060
and start to try to bring in our mind

165
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,759
some of those alleles that may have been

166
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,560
lost in the domestication process this

167
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,960
is a

168
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,060
picture of the brittle reyes and if

169
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,918
you've ever never encountered this

170
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,009
you've probably encountered brittle

171
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:16,258
rei'kas in other wild grassy weed

172
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:18,090
species and you walk through those

173
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,400
fields in the summer and half the field

174
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:22,500
winds up in your socks and so it's an

175
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,968
excellent seed dispersal mechanism and

176
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,490
of course just the thing we don't want

177
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:30,180
in agriculture because we want those

178
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:32,158
seeds to hang on into their seeds to

179
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,668
remain on the head as long as possible

180
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:37,918
what's kind of interesting about the BTR

181
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:39,779
genes there's two of them is that both

182
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,698
of them are loss of functions there's

183
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:44,728
deletions and that leads to a loss of

184
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:47,340
function of the abscission layer there

185
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:50,339
vrs one which is the two row 6 row is

186
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:53,038
also a loss of function situation also

187
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:56,278
due in this case to multiple different

188
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,649
deletions inside the same gene nud the

189
00:07:56,278 --> 00:08:01,680
whole advance is also a loss of function

190
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:04,109
in this case the whole gene is gone just

191
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,908
takeda and all revealed that in all the

192
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,610
exceptions that they looked at the gene

193
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:11,158
has just disappeared 17 KB of it plus

194
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:15,750
some flanking sequence they have then

195
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:18,718
generated some new mutants and then kept

196
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:22,050
up with other ways of generating the

197
00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:24,839
same phenotype growth habits again not

198
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,300
the topic of today's seminar but loss of

199
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,098
function deletions and flowering time

200
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,978
there are also loss of function deletion

201
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:34,408
so it's just this kind of long list of

202
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:36,418
these domestication traits being loss of

203
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:38,278
function and that kind of gives us

204
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:40,198
something to think about if you think

205
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:42,328
about some of the simplest applications

206
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:43,948
of genome editing how many other things

207
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:45,809
are there out there that you might want

208
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:48,120
to go into and then just generate loss

209
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:50,809
of function mutants with and come up

210
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,909
with target phenotypes

211
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:56,388
so or some paper that just came out

212
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:59,578
recently here in Nature Genetics

213
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:02,339
by masher at all and they report on

214
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:03,679
doing a lot of nice genomics on some

215
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,930
paleo

216
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:10,679
botanical remains of barley at Masada in

217
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:12,808
Israel and it they you know there's a

218
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,278
lot to see about this barley including

219
00:09:12,808 --> 00:09:16,769
the fact that it looks very much like

220
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:18,600
Barley's we might see today in

221
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:20,759
fluorescence might be just a tad shorter

222
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,399
but one thing about it it was still

223
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,919
covered in so 4,000 years post

224
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,379
domestication in that end of the world

225
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,269
there was still covered barley now

226
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:32,449
Takeda it all argued that there was

227
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:36,480
probably a monophyletic

228
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:38,938
origin of the naked tree and that that

229
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,199
domestication event happened about 8,000

230
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:42,328
years ago so they're not sure exactly

231
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:44,789
where this happened but we've got a

232
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:46,169
couple of hints as to where that may

233
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:47,958
have been and we'll come to that in just

234
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:50,789
a second here

235
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,958
so you have this domestication moment

236
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:54,990
you have the Middle East and then you

237
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:57,318
have this just explosive dissemination

238
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:01,379
of Agriculture and animal husbandry

239
00:09:57,318 --> 00:10:03,269
across Europe and Asia and that's

240
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:06,089
proceeding at a rate of maybe about a

241
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,339
mile per year and so that may seem kind

242
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:10,920
of slow if you can walk 20 miles in a

243
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,529
day but you know when you think about

244
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:15,448
actually then planting harvesting a crop

245
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:17,698
and then convincing your neighbor to

246
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:20,039
plant and harvest that crop then mile

247
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:22,919
progressions every year are actually

248
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:25,789
pretty impressive so quickly barley

249
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:29,039
moves out across the landscape and

250
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:32,039
this migration and specialization then

251
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:34,769
leads to things that come back to the

252
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:36,480
halt and so I've kind of told this

253
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:38,519
little history here of barley and then

254
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,259
I'm coming into this sort of migration

255
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,240
thing to tell you a little bit about

256
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:44,870
Europe and a little bit about Asia and

257
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,688
then some alternate uses of barley and

258
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:50,629
holes in those two environments so in

259
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:54,928
Europe you had a

260
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:58,110
an ever-increasing focus on barley for

261
00:10:54,928 --> 00:11:00,088
its use in the manufacture of beer not

262
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,818
to say there weren't uses also for human

263
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:05,500
food and animal feeding and so forth but

264
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:07,870
principally for beer and principally the

265
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,080
forms that were used were barley with

266
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:13,269
holes and those tended to be spring

267
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,960
growth habits and they tended to be two

268
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:18,149
rows so in this little cartoon here you

269
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,519
see a

270
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:24,039
representation of the Reinheitsgebot and

271
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,159
this is the German purity law this is

272
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:29,079
barley here this is hops this is water

273
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:31,419
and that's yeast course they didn't know

274
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,820
about yeast at that time that was sort

275
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:36,639
of added later but the argument was and

276
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,710
not the argument the law was and is that

277
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,590
the beer could only contain those three

278
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,720
and four elements and it did not contain

279
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,639
adjuncts so this is an angry wheat and

280
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,769
angry maize and an angry rice up here

281
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,259
who cannot participate in the beer as

282
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:52,569
they are want to do in American Standard

283
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:55,149
lagers so when I first learned about

284
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,610
this as a as a barley breeder I thought

285
00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:00,610
wow that is just you know another

286
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:03,190
example of people really knowing good

287
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,810
beer and so there's this German brewing

288
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,790
tradition and you'd think wow they had

289
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:09,519
this law that just sort of embodied

290
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:11,379
their their knowledge about beer and in

291
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,689
fact it turns out that it was probably

292
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,850
this law was there for a number of other

293
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,610
reasons one is it protected drinkers

294
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:21,670
from high prices it banned the use of

295
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,440
wheat in beer so that more bread could

296
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:26,649
be made and so the fact of the matter

297
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,300
was the the beer drinkers were using up

298
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:30,309
the available wheat and that wasn't

299
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:32,649
leaving enough food for the rest of

300
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:35,229
society and so they said well hey make

301
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:37,659
the beer out of the coarser grain and

302
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:41,110
then leave the wheat out there for

303
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:43,059
nutrition now if you're half of i'ts an

304
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,250
enthusiast or something you'll know that

305
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:47,559
there was still a tradition of brewing

306
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,690
with wheat in Germany but the other

307
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,419
piece there was that unscrupulous ruiers

308
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,200
were adding toxic and even

309
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:54,789
hallucinogenic ingredients as

310
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,460
preservatives or flavorings in their

311
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:59,799
beers and so you know that's a whole

312
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,810
frontier that will continuously be

313
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,490
explored I think as we see an increase

314
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:04,319
in craft brewing and leaked legalized

315
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,759
cannabis

316
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,990
and so those two elements will probably

317
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:10,330
be coming together and we may be

318
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,320
promulgating a new Reinheitsgebot here

319
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,470
too

320
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,780
that sort of thing from happening again

321
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:19,930
so meanwhile a very different sort of

322
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:22,019
scenario has unfolded in in Asia and

323
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:27,099
particularly in Central and East Asia

324
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:30,340
their barley assumes a role in food and

325
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:33,670
so it's particularly its role in food

326
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:36,100
was most notable in the Himalayan

327
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:39,849
plateau and so this gentleman's a

328
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:42,850
tibetan buddhist monk and he's preparing

329
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:45,129
to eat some some pup which is in this

330
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,560
case prepared from a toasted barley

331
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:49,570
flour and that's mixed with yak butter

332
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:50,729
and green tea and so it's a very

333
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,450
nutritious

334
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,120
material that can be very easily

335
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,100
prepared there are very high elevations

336
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,080
not a tremendous amount of

337
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,950
infrastructure required to prepare this

338
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,850
food and so a recent paper in science by

339
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:09,100
chen at all actually argues that

340
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:11,110
barley in fact allowed for the

341
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,670
settlement of the himalayan plateau that

342
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,740
you simply could not have moved into

343
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:17,709
those higher elevations had it not been

344
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,799
for this very early maturing cereal and

345
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:23,110
also in their case a cereal that was

346
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:26,469
naked so that it could be immediately

347
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:30,100
consumed so you may ask well you know

348
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:33,639
why can't she just eat barley so you you

349
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:36,490
could but that's lemma those dilemma and

350
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:39,699
paleo that hall consists of cellulose

351
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:42,070
hemicellulose and lignin and it's not

352
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:45,400
palatable it is insoluble dietary fiber

353
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:47,530
and wears a lot of us need fiber in our

354
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,689
diets we generally don't need insoluble

355
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,329
dietary fiber and so it's just much

356
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:56,290
easier to not have it there anybody eat

357
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:59,440
barley today yeah today I mean white

358
00:14:56,289 --> 00:15:01,389
bean in every day John okay so we'll

359
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,030
talk about that later but okay anybody

360
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:05,379
barley this wheat oh my god that's why

361
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,589
we come out from the west to the east

362
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:10,870
and we proselytize our crops yeah okay

363
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,480
so was it a pearl barley perhaps that

364
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,700
you have if anybody so pearl what is

365
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,070
pearl barley pearl barley is barley that

366
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,070
has been mechanically abraded to remove

367
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,930
the hull and so if you have a naked

368
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,660
barley you don't have to pearl it but if

369
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:27,669
purling this grinding process in that

370
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:30,069
grinding process removes dilemma and

371
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:31,990
palea and it also removes a little bit

372
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,550
of testa a little bit of pericarp a

373
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,159
little bit of alley around and that's

374
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:38,009
enough to make your barley no longer be

375
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,480
considered a whole grain

376
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:42,460
legally so whether or not you're losing

377
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,779
you know phytonutrients that's a whole

378
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,550
other topic of discussion here but

379
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,829
legally you cannot call that a whole

380
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:50,529
grain so not the tibetans were worried

381
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,860
about whole grain or not but they

382
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:55,209
selected for naked and incidentally

383
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,789
populations where there is high

384
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:01,360
consumption of barley have the lowest

385
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:04,299
incidence of colorectal cancers of any

386
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,100
societies so soluble dietary fiber is a

387
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:08,529
good thing also has a number of other

388
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,240
positive effects that we'll come to in

389
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:12,089
just a little bit this is just a quick

390
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,799
walk through of a Japanese grocery store

391
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:17,769
showing a whole sample of barley

392
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:20,349
products that you know readily

393
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:22,899
accessible now as you got into China and

394
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,940
Japan and Korea barley was an important

395
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:27,309
part of the culinary nutrition culture

396
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:30,040
but of course rice was was preeminent

397
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:32,289
there and so barley has kind of to my

398
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:34,299
understanding a subsidiary role and

399
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:36,549
sometimes a very sort of a negative

400
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:38,949
perception role in those areas where it

401
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:41,049
is viewed as the famine food so it was

402
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,790
what you ate only when you didn't have

403
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:44,469
rice and so that's been kind of a

404
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:46,110
psychological barrier that people have

405
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,330
been having to work for

406
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:52,330
so that kind of brings us to what's

407
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:56,940
barley used for and you know what's

408
00:16:52,330 --> 00:17:00,610
implied so what do we have here

409
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:03,520
malt in the making so the process of

410
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:06,670
melting barley is a process of

411
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,950
controlled germination and this is the

412
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,200
result of

413
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,880
the end of the first phase and into the

414
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,799
second phase and so you've gone through

415
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,690
what's called the Steep where the barley

416
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,399
is alternatively soaked and then exposed

417
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,140
to air and then it's allowed to

418
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,060
germinate and these are the little

419
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,670
reutlitz that are emerging and the

420
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:26,829
incipient chute is actually forming in

421
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,870
under the whole but you can't see it in

422
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,659
this case because it is a barley that

423
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:33,609
that has a hole and once that

424
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,410
germination process is accomplished then

425
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:36,669
the barley is killed and

426
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,920
depending on the temperature and

427
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:41,230
duration of that killing process you

428
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,090
come out with a range of malts which

429
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,099
then go into our beers and so you have

430
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:47,759
everything from pale malts all the way

431
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:50,799
to roasted malts at the other extreme

432
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:53,349
the so you might ask the question well

433
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,359
why barley why don't we do this anything

434
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:57,969
else and the answer is you can do it to

435
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,709
anything else and there are now Moulton

436
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,809
companies that are moulting other grains

437
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,720
besides barley notable is one in

438
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:07,450
Colorado called Grouse malting and their

439
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,640
monstrous twill ax is an expert in

440
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:12,549
molting things like chia and buckwheat

441
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,380
and other grains then for celiacs who

442
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:18,099
would like to have molted grains going

443
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:21,940
into a beer but why malted barley for

444
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:24,519
beer so malted barley is is like a

445
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,880
perfect little nutrition capsule for

446
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:29,619
yeast and in the process of fermentation

447
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,440
what we're after is ethanol and so we're

448
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:34,479
harnessing the yeast to give its give us

449
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,710
its excretion so that we can have

450
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,539
ethanol and flavor and if you wanted to

451
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,400
design the perfect little nutrient

452
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:44,799
capsule for yeast it's going to be that

453
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,810
malted barley kernel so that's why of

454
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,059
all the cereals that are out there

455
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:52,690
barley provides the optimum balance of

456
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:54,519
starch sugars proteins and that can

457
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,980
carry on the fermentation process and

458
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,049
allow yeast to do for us what we want it

459
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,519
to do

460
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:05,440
so what about barley foods so

461
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:08,440
barley foods today account for a

462
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,150
negligible portion of the total barley

463
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,259
that's produced in the United States and

464
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:17,170
consumed certainly less than 10%

465
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:21,460
however the FDA says that if you

466
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:25,240
incorporate barley at a specified amount

467
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:27,340
into your diet you will reduce your risk

468
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,950
of heart disease you'll reduce your risk

469
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:31,379
of type 2 diabetes and you will achieve

470
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,120
satiety

471
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,830
achieving satiety alone is something

472
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:38,139
that could be a goal for many of us

473
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:40,179
right just to sort of be cool and happy

474
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,680
with wherever you are so just eat your

475
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:45,670
barley and that's where it will take you

476
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:47,680
so what accounts for this this these

477
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,850
wonderful properties it's it is a

478
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,840
soluble dietary fiber fraction called

479
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:55,759
beta glucan and beta glucan is found in

480
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,220
cell walls throughout the barley

481
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,399
endosperm beta glucans found in

482
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,308
appreciable quantities only in oatmeal

483
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:05,629
otherwise and in oats and in oatmeal

484
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:08,778
marks orals isn't here so I can really

485
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:11,059
knock oats but in oats it's only found

486
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:13,759
in the outer layer of the endosperm and

487
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:16,278
that's why oats make that horrible gluey

488
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,019
icky thing when you cook them because

489
00:20:16,278 --> 00:20:19,940
the beta glucan is just sort of right

490
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:21,980
out there you cook barley flakes and

491
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,778
you'll have actual integrity of each

492
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,378
flake but you'll still have the same

493
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:30,200
level of beta glucan so as soon as the

494
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:32,719
FDA comes out with this RDA and there

495
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,058
was research prior to that then of

496
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,778
course what do we do is plant breeders

497
00:20:35,058 --> 00:20:41,298
well if a little bit is good a lot would

498
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:43,159
be better right so all of a sudden every

499
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:45,859
breeding program is out there going well

500
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,840
let's breed for high beta glucan and so

501
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:50,750
they've been in fact very successful in

502
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:53,538
doing so your average barley a moulting

503
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:56,769
barley will contain about four to five

504
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:59,450
percent grain beta glucan

505
00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:01,819
that's beta glucan and the malting

506
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,190
barley is broken down by beta glucan ace

507
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:07,819
endogenous beta glucan aces during the

508
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:10,190
malting process and in fact brewers want

509
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:12,859
low levels of beta glucan in their beer

510
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,350
otherwise it becomes viscous and causes

511
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:17,269
processing problems so on the food on

512
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:20,240
the other hand you say Wow beta glucan I

513
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:21,919
want this in my food and so breeders

514
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,500
have been very successful even over the

515
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,840
last 10 years in developing high beta

516
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,349
glucan Barley's and they now have them

517
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:32,990
up to say 15%

518
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:35,058
if you were to eat one bowl of barley

519
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,429
flakes made from a barley that's four

520
00:21:35,058 --> 00:21:41,028
percent beta glucan that will satisfy

521
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:43,730
your RDA these are barley breads made

522
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:45,888
with 40 percent barley flour barley has

523
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:48,589
gluten in the sense that it will Alicia

524
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:50,959
eight elicits a negative response in a

525
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:53,089
celiac but it does not have gluten in

526
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,159
for a baker in the sense that its dough

527
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:57,589
does not have strength and elasticity so

528
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,539
you you're about your maximum blend is

529
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:02,118
going to be about 40 percent barley

530
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:06,259
going into a wheat blend but if you have

531
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:08,058
two slices of bread made with a barley

532
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:11,139
that's about four to five percent beta

533
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:14,628
glucan you will meet your RDA a sandwich

534
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:15,849
so what happens if you eat 15% beta

535
00:22:14,628 --> 00:22:20,028
glucan

536
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:22,418
gastrointestinal distress of epic

537
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:24,579
room-clearing proportions

538
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:27,799
so

539
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:29,418
what then why do I do this so plant

540
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:31,038
breeders be careful once you start going

541
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:32,690
down this road of selecting four more

542
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:36,138
there are sometimes unanticipated

543
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:39,249
pleiotropic effects right so the so

544
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:41,628
what's that has led to is kind of a

545
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:44,149
schism in barley breeding if you will

546
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:46,189
where if you have a whole-grain model

547
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:47,928
you just can get by with four to five

548
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,450
percent beta glucan you don't need that

549
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:52,788
high stuff if however you're on a model

550
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:55,308
where you want to extract or fraction

551
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:57,288
ate the beta glucan and put that onto a

552
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:59,118
Twinkie or a cheeto and call it health

553
00:22:57,288 --> 00:23:01,249
food then you want to go for the high

554
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:03,788
stuff so there's sort of two different

555
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:06,399
markets out there

556
00:23:03,788 --> 00:23:08,839
so feed

557
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:11,209
80% of the barley used in the world

558
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:13,249
today is used to feed animals mostly

559
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,379
ruminant animals but I don't didn't have

560
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:17,358
a nice picture of cow so I picture of

561
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:18,798
these pigs and these pigs in fact are in

562
00:23:17,358 --> 00:23:20,358
a barley field you see in the distance

563
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,179
there that is a barley field and this

564
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:25,220
farmer just unleashes them into barley

565
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:27,440
fields and then moves the electric fence

566
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,479
a couple hundred feet every day and the

567
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,460
pigs are happier than if they were in

568
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:33,169
clover you know the expression like a

569
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,819
pig in clover so they're very happy

570
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:36,259
they're just eating this this green

571
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:38,329
barley as they go along and that's the

572
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:40,999
residue of the barley straw below but

573
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:42,878
most of the barley in the world today is

574
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:47,839
fed to animals and

575
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:50,358
about 80% and in the u.s. until about

576
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,098
maybe 20 years ago and we'll see the

577
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:55,069
graph of this and talk about that in a

578
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:57,888
sec that was also the case here now

579
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:59,928
we've had a complete flip so that almost

580
00:23:57,888 --> 00:24:02,058
all the barley grown in the United

581
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:04,849
States is used for melting and brewing a

582
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:07,418
little bit for food and a very little

583
00:24:04,848 --> 00:24:10,069
bit for feed but the feed markets are

584
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:12,680
essential in my opinion because if you

585
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:14,769
don't have a feed market you have no

586
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,360
safety net for your grain

587
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:20,829
barley is has excellent feeding

588
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:25,119
properties and a lot of research

589
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:27,409
you know has it confirms that and

590
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,849
sort of brings us to this point here so

591
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,350
we'll talk about that research in a

592
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:33,849
moment once we've talked about how we

593
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:33,849
got to this so what do you think this is

594
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:44,779
US barley acreage millions of acres

595
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:47,570
so if you follow this graph back to 1986

596
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:50,089
which is when I started my job it's even

597
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,950
more obviously linear so it's a

598
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:54,349
cause-and-effect relationship the longer

599
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,890
pat breeds barley in Oregon the more the

600
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:59,299
barley acres in America go down

601
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:02,140
once it's established god bless the

602
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:02,139
tenure system right

603
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:08,770
now so there's a number of reasons why

604
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,590
this has happened and

605
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:14,210
before we go into you know sort of this

606
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:16,009
slope of despondency here let's talk

607
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,870
about this little plateau of

608
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:19,450
encouragement over here and what that's

609
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:22,189
due to so

610
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,930
little plateau of encouragement is due

611
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,700
to places like New York State amongst

612
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:28,220
others where barley acreage is actually

613
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,860
increasing and why is it increasing its

614
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:33,079
increasing because of the craft brewing

615
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:35,029
craft distilling and craft melting

616
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:36,710
industries and then in addition here

617
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:40,190
you've legislated and that is further

618
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:42,590
driven barley acres and so the craft

619
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:44,150
industry is what is driving this the

620
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:45,490
slight increase but it's really going to

621
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,920
be a tapering

622
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,599
phenomena because there's only so much

623
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,570
barley that those industries can absorb

624
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:57,469
for example if you're running a craft

625
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:59,779
moulting enterprise 10-ton batch is a

626
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,730
pretty respectable batch size a lot of

627
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:05,420
them are smaller than that to run a

628
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:07,670
10-ton batch system requires about 500

629
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,500
acres of barley high yielding barley so

630
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,870
it doesn't take a whole lot to meet

631
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,670
those needs and so you have the Sunoco

632
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:15,859
facility opening up here in New York

633
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,620
State that's going to have I think six

634
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:19,969
10 tonne errs chomping on barley and so

635
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,399
that's going to lead to an increase in

636
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,120
acres but in terms of overall impact

637
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,570
it's still a couple of thousand acre

638
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:30,959
we'll probably feed that machine

639
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:32,250
so what caused that decline so there's a

640
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,558
there's a whole there's a number of

641
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:37,048
factors that contributed to that decline

642
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,089
but they are all feeding into this sort

643
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:41,869
of story where we're headed here and

644
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:44,778
anybody in here ever played pit

645
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:48,298
what was your favorite commodity just

646
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:50,278
say barley okay it's a supposed to be

647
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:51,538
the Chicago Board of Trade game and so

648
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:53,038
you're pretending that you're down in

649
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:54,359
the pit and you're calling out

650
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:55,379
commodities and you've got pork belly

651
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,879
pork belly and you got barley barley

652
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,799
barley barley barley is one of the cards

653
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,669
but barley is no longer traded on the

654
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:04,069
Chicago hoard and so that sort of shows

655
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:07,230
where it's at

656
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:09,148
look at where barley is going here the

657
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,759
largest importer of barley if you had

658
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:14,729
any assailed by Saudi Arabia

659
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:17,009
followed by China so China is a definite

660
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,849
beer market there Australia and Canada

661
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:22,500
dominate that market Saudi Arabia is

662
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:26,158
primarily a traditional livestock use

663
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,829
area and a lot of racing camels are

664
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,960
barley not a particularly stable market

665
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:33,000
the racing camel in an era of declining

666
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,679
revenues in some of these countries but

667
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,569
what are we seeing we're seeing a

668
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,269
situation where barley is actually

669
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:42,240
priced after corn it's a function of

670
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:46,230
corn prices and so typically barley is

671
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,450
priced at 80% of the price of corn corn

672
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:50,669
prices now are incredibly depressed if

673
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,860
you know to follow commodities markets

674
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:55,470
their feed prices are incredibly low at

675
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:57,479
the moment if barley is 80 percent of

676
00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:00,240
something incredibly low which is true

677
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,259
in conventional feed barley production

678
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,579
you lose money from the get-go so

679
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:07,970
that's a reason people don't want to

680
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:11,069
have feed barley out there why is there

681
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:13,140
wire feed barley prices so low when the

682
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:15,869
research confirms that probably the

683
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,179
feeding value of barley can be the same

684
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:20,129
or superior to corn in some feeding

685
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:22,320
applications a couple of things have

686
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,419
happened which are so much bigger than

687
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,099
anything that we can address is plant

688
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:28,559
breeders are scientists that we just

689
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:30,658
have to mention them and move on so one

690
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,058
of them are federal farm programs we

691
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:35,880
have a program of very indirect price

692
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:37,720
supports in in the US and one of them is

693
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,570
called revenue assurance where you can

694
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,970
essentially ensure your crop if you have

695
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:44,889
the right crop to a value that you know

696
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:47,130
will allow you to generate a stable

697
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:49,210
income you can't do that for barley

698
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,740
secondly you have a situation where

699
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,319
you've had changes in the confined

700
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,730
animal feeding

701
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,490
industry so now you have enormous

702
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:00,700
operations for consolidated dairies and

703
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:02,890
feed Lots and even in Oregon these folks

704
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,319
find it cheaper to bring in Midwestern

705
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:07,720
corn and unit trains than to buy barley

706
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,279
from the farm next door so that that

707
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,100
leads to a situation where you then have

708
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,918
no market for feed even if you do have a

709
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:17,139
place to actually be selling it and then

710
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,320
you have sort of you know kind of the

711
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,669
final clincher in this which is you have

712
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:23,798
incredibly successful plant breeders in

713
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:26,650
the Midwest breeding corn and soybeans

714
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,500
and corn and soybeans along with global

715
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:31,269
warming have moved increasingly

716
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,669
northward and westward and occupied what

717
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,339
were barley acres in Minnesota and North

718
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:38,380
Dakota

719
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:40,329
that corn and soybeans happens to be GMO

720
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,159
which is neither you know here nor there

721
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:44,408
I think in terms of that effect on

722
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,760
barley but it does play into the story

723
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:47,559
that we're going to come to in a sec out

724
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:50,859
in our neck of the woods we don't have a

725
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:53,079
whole lot of GMO corn our soybeans at

726
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:55,479
this point but we do have herbicide

727
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:57,730
resistant wheat we have imidazole and

728
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,250
resistant wheat generated as a mutation

729
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:02,710
not as a GMO but the consequence of that

730
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,869
is that herbicide is applied to ground

731
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,179
where formerly barley was a rotation

732
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:10,269
crop that herbicide persists for 12

733
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:12,970
months and the barley can't follow in

734
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:14,918
the rotation so between all of those

735
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:18,548
factors then we've seen barley acres

736
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:20,200
plummet and you know what do you do well

737
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:21,700
since I've worked on barley for 30 years

738
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,200
I don't want to see it disappear I don't

739
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,029
want to see it just become a relic crop

740
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,950
but I do think in addition to just

741
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:29,859
wanting things to persist because

742
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:32,019
they're cool that there are reasons that

743
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:34,329
barley can be advantageous for farmers

744
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:37,558
it's early maturing two weeks earlier

745
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:39,970
than wheat uses about 80 20 percent less

746
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:42,490
nitrogen than wheat but has all the same

747
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,380
standard green infrastructure processors

748
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,359
it's absolutely essential for molting

749
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,100
for food processors the same

750
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,898
infrastructure you use for milling

751
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:51,058
grinding

752
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:53,338
cracking for the feed industry rations

753
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:55,219
and delivery can be the same consumers

754
00:30:53,338 --> 00:30:57,989
gives you a range of beverages

755
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:59,249
heart-healthy foods in some new sensory

756
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,659
attributes in your diet so I think

757
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:03,229
there's a lot of good reasons to have

758
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:06,059
barley out there in our lives

759
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:10,319
but it's it's hard to convince people

760
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:12,538
sometimes that that's necessary and so

761
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,858
what I've got now is to shift gears a

762
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:16,288
little bit and I've kind of told you

763
00:31:13,858 --> 00:31:18,358
this barley story and use you as a bit

764
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:20,009
of a focus group because we're having a

765
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:22,858
planning grant session at the end of

766
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:24,960
this month and it's funded by the NIF o

767
00:31:22,858 --> 00:31:28,710
REI so that's the organic research

768
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,119
branch of nipa and a planning grant is

769
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,679
where you kind of get people together to

770
00:31:30,118 --> 00:31:34,009
say do we really want to write a full

771
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,809
grant proposal on this thing and

772
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:38,878
the proposal is about the release

773
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:41,579
testing and development of public sector

774
00:31:38,878 --> 00:31:43,079
multi-use naked barley varieties so

775
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:46,499
that's where I come back to this topic

776
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:49,348
here this is barley here winter barley

777
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:51,479
growing next to a GMO corn and on a

778
00:31:49,348 --> 00:31:53,908
per-unit efficiency basis this thing is

779
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:57,419
going to produce a whole lot more than

780
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:59,609
this one over here but in this

781
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:01,499
particular case this is not a comparison

782
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:03,569
because that is a GMO corn which this

783
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:05,729
particular panel will not allow so the

784
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:07,588
question is then okay we come into the

785
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:10,229
organic panel what could we do that

786
00:32:07,588 --> 00:32:11,579
would capitalize on the kinds of

787
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:14,960
research that they might be interested

788
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:17,999
in funding and why

789
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,969
so the first thing is is that we're

790
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:25,169
looking at market simplification here so

791
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:28,320
if you have a naked barley in theory it

792
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:30,778
could be used for all three uses okay

793
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,658
you could vault with it you could eat it

794
00:32:30,778 --> 00:32:36,118
and you could use it as feed so a farmer

795
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:38,759
currently if they raise malt barley has

796
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:41,579
barley with a halt can they sell it as

797
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:43,499
food if they have excess protein no

798
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:45,148
you'd have to grind the whole off can

799
00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:47,548
they sell it for feed no they're going

800
00:32:45,148 --> 00:32:49,378
to be at a loss if you're selling if

801
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:51,418
you're growing a naked barley can you

802
00:32:49,378 --> 00:32:52,498
get a mold stirrer brewer to use it and

803
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,450
the answer is no because they're not

804
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:56,460
familiar with moulting and brewing with

805
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,629
Naked Barley's can you get a feeder to

806
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,039
use it you're going to have to go

807
00:32:57,628 --> 00:33:03,039
uncover someone so in the convince

808
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:07,359
large-scale commodity markets there is

809
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:10,359
not room to pursue this multi-use good

810
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,429
idea hence the idea of saying ok the

811
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:15,039
organic sector may be receptive to a

812
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:17,410
newer idea and thus that could be a

813
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,629
platform where we could seek to get some

814
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:22,690
acceptance some adoption and then let it

815
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,730
diffuse out from there some attributes

816
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:27,250
will be that it has to be naked first

817
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:29,829
and foremost it has to have modest grain

818
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,869
beta-glucan you can't have 15% erse

819
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:33,819
because the Brewers won't use it it's

820
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:35,649
got to have normal starch there's waxy

821
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:37,149
and high amylose starch types we want to

822
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,800
avoid those you're gonna have to have

823
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,269
yield and adaptation in your target

824
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,099
environments and you're going to want to

825
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:44,259
have some entry interesting sensory

826
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:46,389
attributes that you know big people want

827
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:48,009
to eat this stuff you can kind of follow

828
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,840
a maximum that's been around there for a

829
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:52,599
long time which that a good malt barley

830
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,099
is a good feed and a good feed barley if

831
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:56,349
you don't believe that these are ice

832
00:33:54,099 --> 00:34:00,899
cream sandwiches made out of barley

833
00:33:56,349 --> 00:34:00,899
cookies with a barley malt ice cream

834
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:08,170
sensory attributes fiber

835
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,970
flavor calories okay so what are we

836
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:12,909
saying here that in this situation we

837
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:15,789
are looking for the elimination of the

838
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:18,309
hall after 10,000 years it's time to

839
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:20,199
just go naked and then say okay let's

840
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:23,880
focus on this particular aspect of

841
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:26,619
barley so why go you know organic

842
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,570
anybody in here done on farm organic

843
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:30,909
research

844
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:32,980
organic breeding scale plots can be some

845
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,719
challenges right particularly weed

846
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,860
control

847
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:38,259
amongst other things and certainly in

848
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:40,750
our environment our University farm has

849
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,030
a very limited certified organic acreage

850
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:45,460
they can't put in really representative

851
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:47,500
rotations to properly encourage

852
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,119
fertility and weed control and so as a

853
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,940
consequence you get into this kind of

854
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,549
weird input replacement and endless weed

855
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,800
Patrol so this was an organic increased

856
00:34:54,550 --> 00:35:00,120
block of a new naked barley of ours it's

857
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,710
called buck okay buck naked barley

858
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:05,139
tough there's some additional work there

859
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,789
we with the organic route again because

860
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:09,219
the idea was hey there'd be perhaps

861
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:11,769
receptiveness to this concept we also

862
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:13,419
struck out with the conventional panels

863
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:16,210
we had some really elegant genomic

864
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,130
selection models for human food we

865
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,349
created resource I'll mention in a

866
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:22,358
second here but as I told the graduate

867
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:25,480
students earlier today never remain

868
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:27,429
bitter about reviews but just memorize

869
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,869
them and repeat them because someday

870
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:32,259
that person is going to be in the room

871
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:34,059
and then they'll understand the mortal

872
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,040
wound that they inflicted on a fellow

873
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:37,659
scientist so we got a review from one of

874
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:41,199
these genomic selection proposals and

875
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:43,239
this individual says you know hey I can

876
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:46,108
hardly imagine barley as being the

877
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:48,549
poster child for good nutrition

878
00:35:46,108 --> 00:35:51,969
so it's like get some fiber dude you

879
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:53,650
know anyway so what can we do to make

880
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:55,358
this happen so the first and fundamental

881
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:57,910
thing you may go well wait a second

882
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,409
barley has had a hole on it for 10,000

883
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:02,348
years because of the brewing tradition

884
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:04,000
in that hole is absolutely critical so

885
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:06,940
this is barley moulting with a hole on

886
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,159
it because of a process called loitering

887
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,579
and loitering is after you have taken

888
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:14,559
your malt and you have boiled it and

889
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:17,259
added your bittering hops then that

890
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:19,210
liquid called the wort is then passed

891
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,220
through the grain bed and the process

892
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,159
known as sparging and moved off to the

893
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:26,618
fermenter that grain that spent malt at

894
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:29,469
the bottom of that tank then is a

895
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:31,838
natural filtration system par excellence

896
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:34,088
and that's why holes have persisted

897
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,190
until today so you ask the question how

898
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:39,088
can we get past that and it is with a

899
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:42,250
technology called mash filtration

900
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:44,380
membranes and pressure use a whole lot

901
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:47,409
less water and a whole lot less energy

902
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,030
so many breweries in Europe are Team

903
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:51,489
Asheville tur breweries they went that

904
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:54,339
way simply to reduce energy and water

905
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:56,079
usage in the US Alaskan amber you may be

906
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:58,329
familiar with as a mash filter quit

907
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,519
brewery and we've got three or so craft

908
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:03,400
breweries in the US including one that

909
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:05,559
just built a new brewery in Bend Oregon

910
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,500
Krux fermentation project that is all

911
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:10,989
mash filter based so we do have ways now

912
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,820
that you can move a naked barley malt so

913
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:15,279
this is naked barley malting down here

914
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,650
directly into a mash filtration system

915
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,359
those of you that are barley people one

916
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,329
of the key parameters that we work on

917
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:25,018
for moulting is something called malt

918
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:27,599
extract both extract numbers of a good

919
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:31,078
barley with a whole are typically around

920
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,479
eighty to eighty three percent in a

921
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:36,660
naked barley that malt extract can be at

922
00:37:33,478 --> 00:37:39,598
88 or 89 percent what does that mean

923
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:41,759
that means more beer per unit of malt

924
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,068
put into the brewery so the Brewers can

925
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:46,130
be very attracted by that what else is a

926
00:37:44,068 --> 00:37:47,958
whole bringing to beer

927
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:51,209
astringency

928
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:53,548
microorganisms things that you may not

929
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:56,068
particularly want in some styles of beer

930
00:37:53,548 --> 00:37:57,349
so I think that we have some advantages

931
00:37:56,068 --> 00:38:00,630
there for the brewer

932
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:02,838
what about four foods so this was at a

933
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:05,818
recent event in in Portland called the

934
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:07,528
plant variety showcase it's a thing

935
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:10,199
called the culinary breeding Network and

936
00:38:07,528 --> 00:38:13,259
so this is a local Baker who's prepared

937
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:14,578
a series of breads from different barley

938
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:17,039
varieties because the point of this was

939
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:19,709
to showcase the foods made from a range

940
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:22,920
of barley varieties and pepper varieties

941
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:25,739
and squash varieties and so forth and so

942
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,170
yes you can do it you can make delicious

943
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:30,028
breads of all sorts and styles with

944
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:32,729
different types of barley up to about

945
00:38:30,028 --> 00:38:35,518
that 40% inclusion rate and that could

946
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:37,439
be exactly the same barley that went to

947
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:41,189
your malt house could go into those lows

948
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,650
and better yet the malt that you made

949
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:46,108
out of that naked barley can also feed

950
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,239
back into your baking system and that

951
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:52,278
brings in a whole other palette of

952
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,278
flavors aromas and sensories

953
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:57,059
finally the organic feed sector at least

954
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:58,498
by the advertisements we see they all

955
00:38:57,059 --> 00:39:01,798
have a much better time at their lives

956
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:05,518
than some people and some other sorts of

957
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:07,798
operations and so optimistically yes we

958
00:39:05,518 --> 00:39:10,288
can see whole grain barley is moving

959
00:39:07,798 --> 00:39:13,768
into various animal feeding regimes

960
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:16,949
because that that safety net is

961
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:19,659
absolutely essential as the third leg on

962
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:20,818
a stool if you will for marketing

963
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:22,899
barley crop

964
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:24,730
so now we come to the plant breeding

965
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,289
part of this you know I'll finally here

966
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,269
in the last you know seven minutes or

967
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:30,369
whatever that we have and so you know

968
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:33,909
after thirty years of writing grant

969
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:35,440
proposals to brewing companies and NSF

970
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:37,509
panels and other people about different

971
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,950
aspects of our crop finally this is like

972
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,329
the first time I get to write one it's

973
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:42,608
just sort of carte blanche and you go

974
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:44,680
like all the way back to those just like

975
00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:46,239
sort of fundamental things about what

976
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:47,980
you do with the breeding program and one

977
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,199
of them is you know what are your target

978
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,000
environments who are your target users

979
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:53,588
out there what are the target traits are

980
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
gonna work on what kind of germ plasm

981
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:57,068
are you gonna use how are you gonna

982
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,079
advance that germ plasm what is the

983
00:39:57,068 --> 00:40:01,119
basis of your selection and what kind of

984
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:02,260
varieties are you gonna release I'm just

985
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,390
gonna kind of walk you through these

986
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,220
real quickly and then open it up for

987
00:40:04,389 --> 00:40:08,288
some opportunities for discussion and

988
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:09,459
perspective here so the target

989
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:11,559
environments that we have are the

990
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,059
Pacific Northwest the Upper Midwest and

991
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:15,548
the Northeast that would be New York

992
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:18,660
here with mark Sorrels and this is our

993
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:21,369
colleague Kevin Smith in Minnesota

994
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:22,868
why these regions well we had plant

995
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:25,480
breeders who are interested in this we

996
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:27,760
have processors who are perhaps early

997
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,889
adopters of some technologies we have

998
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,089
consumers who are interested in a

999
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:32,828
variety of foods and then the

1000
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:34,900
anticipation is that we would see a

1001
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:36,548
subsequent diffusion out into other

1002
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,338
geographic areas and into the

1003
00:40:36,548 --> 00:40:41,108
conventional sector as well

1004
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:43,449
our target audiences here's one that we

1005
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:45,400
can have cannot neglect I don't think

1006
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:48,219
and this is a very good friend of the

1007
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,380
families and we had our one of our food

1008
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:52,419
barley composites growing in her garden

1009
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,130
and so she invites her friends over and

1010
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,510
we have this sort of little harvest

1011
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:57,970
party these people had never grown a

1012
00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:00,278
cereal they had never processed a cereal

1013
00:40:57,969 --> 00:41:03,038
they had never prepared a cereal that

1014
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:04,750
was two hours old and so we harvested

1015
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,119
this barley took over our threshing

1016
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:09,699
machine harvested that prepared it and

1017
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,829
had a barley tabbouleh made from

1018
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:13,689
something they harvested hours before we

1019
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:15,760
hit 10 people out there who went and

1020
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,920
told 10 other people who told 10 other

1021
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,480
people about how barley was something

1022
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,519
you could grow at home and it was really

1023
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,740
cool and it was good for you and so

1024
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,449
there's an important piece there but of

1025
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:27,669
equal and greater importance are their

1026
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:30,519
children and so moving barley into

1027
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,559
schools in through various science and

1028
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:33,849
education pieces and so we call this

1029
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,400
sort of the learners they're gonna have

1030
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:38,109
very small acreage things we have

1031
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,510
artists and these are the folks down at

1032
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:43,750
your farmers markets who may have in the

1033
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:46,150
tens of acres craft maybe the hundreds

1034
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:48,358
of acres and then the industrial sort of

1035
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:51,490
regional folks maybe a thousand acres

1036
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:53,259
you know levels and so there's different

1037
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:54,969
audiences we're going to be targeting

1038
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,010
here and I think we need different kinds

1039
00:41:54,969 --> 00:41:58,419
of germ plasm for those people and

1040
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:00,730
there's going to be different sorts of

1041
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:04,000
traits that we target everything has to

1042
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:06,219
be homozygous recessive I think we just

1043
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,719
have to have naked varley's molting and

1044
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:09,519
brewing quality is something that

1045
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:12,250
already exists we have the American malt

1046
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,869
barley Association it has guidelines we

1047
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,219
need some allowance for higher malt

1048
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:17,470
extract they're not going to complain

1049
00:42:15,219 --> 00:42:20,289
about that but maybe just a little bit

1050
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:22,118
higher beta glucan maybe a 200 instead

1051
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:24,670
of a you know under a hundred where they

1052
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:27,309
are now not talking scary levels of beta

1053
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:29,740
glucan in beer food quality is really

1054
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:31,389
very simple as long as you don't bring

1055
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:33,789
in novel starch types or high beta

1056
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:35,500
glucan our life as barley breeders could

1057
00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:38,559
almost be as simple as that of corn

1058
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,420
breeders we just breed for yield we just

1059
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,789
want more of this good naked stuff

1060
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,079
growing per egg per unit acre now of

1061
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:45,880
course you've got all the additional

1062
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,098
challenges of what's going to make yield

1063
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,780
under an organic system but it's yield

1064
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:52,180
that you're after in feed quality I

1065
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:54,099
think it's yield ultimately once you get

1066
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:57,279
greater market penetration then you'll

1067
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:59,170
start to see I think some feed back into

1068
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,810
the breeding programs that says we need

1069
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:03,490
that flavor attribute we need this kind

1070
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:05,519
of kernel hardness we need something

1071
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:08,559
else but we don't have those signals now

1072
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:10,150
growth habit I'd like to see facultative

1073
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,000
in spring Barley's because of climate

1074
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:15,789
change but winners are okay two rows are

1075
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,099
preferred but six rows are okay colors a

1076
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:20,079
whole pallet is okay if you're breeding

1077
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:22,150
for conventional markets right now

1078
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,848
you'll recognize that this is not the

1079
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:26,440
way that you can breed for large

1080
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:29,650
commodity producers they'll tell you

1081
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,539
what color what's specific level of a

1082
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:33,940
hundred and one traits and so you're

1083
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:36,849
much more confined and defined in your

1084
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:38,650
breeding scheme the germplasm basis

1085
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:40,240
we've got some ongoing naked barley

1086
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,338
programs and we have something called

1087
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:44,739
the naked barley doubled haploid

1088
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:46,409
composite we've got a germ plasm release

1089
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:47,909
on this that we're writing up right now

1090
00:43:46,409 --> 00:43:49,949
so it'll come out but the seed is

1091
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:52,679
available if anybody would like to get

1092
00:43:49,949 --> 00:43:55,409
this it's 900 double haploids derived

1093
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:57,329
from about 35 process amongst 28 parents

1094
00:43:55,409 --> 00:43:59,579
40 different grandparents that we source

1095
00:43:57,329 --> 00:44:01,920
from 14 different breeding programs and

1096
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:03,630
selections we created this resource in

1097
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,610
anticipation of doing this genomic

1098
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:07,650
selection program grant didn't get

1099
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:09,539
funded we're in a hurry had to harvest

1100
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:11,750
we said the hell with it drove the

1101
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:15,210
combine perpendicular to all the plots

1102
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:17,730
took us an hour so we just mixed

1103
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:20,630
everything together and so they're all

1104
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:23,159
in there and we've send this

1105
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:25,110
synthesis cools public breeding programs

1106
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:27,149
private breeding programs mark Sorel's

1107
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:30,030
your colleague here has started a naked

1108
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:32,519
barley program based on the naked barley

1109
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:34,950
blood composite it's got Springs witters

1110
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:37,050
facultative two rows six rows whites

1111
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:38,759
blacks Browns etc so there's a whole

1112
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:41,940
range of material in there some very

1113
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:44,820
interesting things to do with schools in

1114
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:46,490
terms of natural selection versus

1115
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:50,100
implemented selection

1116
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:52,379
germ plasm and advance we've got this

1117
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:54,839
all the double haploids that are in this

1118
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,940
composite we still have them we have the

1119
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,820
original and remnant seat so we have all

1120
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:02,070
900 of those my breeding program is a

1121
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,289
hundred percent double haploid based so

1122
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:06,240
we're producing new double haploids from

1123
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:08,250
cycles with naked malt Marley's that

1124
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,500
have come out of a Canadian program and

1125
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:12,539
will pursue a collaborative development

1126
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,340
and testing of those but segregating

1127
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:17,039
generations will be available to those

1128
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,840
who would want them at some point the

1129
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,599
basis of selection for that composite

1130
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:24,150
you can simply go real easy Bob Allard

1131
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,519
published this beautiful paper in the

1132
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,289
late 70s about evolutionary plant

1133
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:31,050
breeding and he showed that just by

1134
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:33,719
planting the same mixture year after

1135
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:35,430
year for his 30 years at UC Davis he had

1136
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:36,689
the same rate of gain as his colleague

1137
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:39,089
Charley Schuyler who was running a

1138
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:40,860
pedigree breeding program and Charley

1139
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:42,480
was a pretty good breeder so natural

1140
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:45,269
selection bulk breeding is not to be

1141
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,190
denied but there's directed phenotypic

1142
00:45:45,269 --> 00:45:48,929
selection genotypic selection there's a

1143
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,079
lot of enthusiasm I would say this is

1144
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:53,039
probably a focus of genomic selection

1145
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:54,480
internationally and so there are

1146
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:56,429
thoughts that we might implement

1147
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,250
something to some extent in a program

1148
00:45:56,429 --> 00:46:00,868
like this and who's the plant breeder

1149
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:02,849
professional or participatory this is a

1150
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:05,849
participatory program we have going on

1151
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:08,640
with two folks in Eastern Oregon this is

1152
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:11,130
Seth and his dad Brad and they're

1153
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,469
working with us to develop a variety in

1154
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,630
their case of double haploid barley that

1155
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:19,289
will specifically feed into their estate

1156
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:21,750
molding system so finally let's come to

1157
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:24,989
germ plasm release what sorts of

1158
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:27,150
varieties will we be releasing here so

1159
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:28,979
you know I lay it all out here I'm an

1160
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:31,410
open source person I get really

1161
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:34,289
concerned about tight control over

1162
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:36,059
germplasm resources and so I support at

1163
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:38,250
least the concept of the open seed

1164
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:40,230
source initiative and we have the

1165
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,659
variety full pint which then we released

1166
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:45,150
underneath the auspices of that

1167
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:47,399
organization we've been using germ plasm

1168
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:49,470
releases we have a particularly stuffy

1169
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,630
tech transfer office in my University

1170
00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:53,909
you could quote me saying that I've

1171
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,380
called them worse sometimes but when

1172
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:57,059
they won't let you release something as

1173
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,410
a variety you can release it as a germ

1174
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:00,779
plasm through the journal of plant

1175
00:46:58,409 --> 00:47:02,670
registrations that gets the material out

1176
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:05,040
into the public domain and people can

1177
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:07,200
access it the problem being that you

1178
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,949
can't sell classes of certified seed

1179
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:14,159
finally we've made some headway and

1180
00:47:09,949 --> 00:47:16,078
except here varieties I had the weirdest

1181
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:17,909
thing this whole trip has been weird I'd

1182
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,190
lost I couldn't get here yesterday so I

1183
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:22,409
had this time frame thing in my travel

1184
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:25,559
and then the spell check quit working in

1185
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:27,149
my PowerPoint and I haven't found a way

1186
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:29,369
to renew that but anyways we've got

1187
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:31,440
public varieties with no PvP so that

1188
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:33,599
gives you an option there the revenue

1189
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,608
thing is an interesting one because our

1190
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,710
office will argue as many that hey we

1191
00:47:35,608 --> 00:47:39,480
need to mine our breeding programs they

1192
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:41,099
need to become self-sustaining if we're

1193
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,349
going to have public sector breeding it

1194
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:45,088
needs to pay for itself if we use the

1195
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:46,950
current seed royalties we have a

1196
00:47:45,088 --> 00:47:48,750
thousand acres is something that

1197
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:50,608
optimistically we would have in one of

1198
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,900
those target growing regions that would

1199
00:47:50,608 --> 00:47:54,150
generate you about two thousand dollars

1200
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:57,180
a year the university would take 1/3 of

1201
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:58,619
that if you took your thousand acres and

1202
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:00,838
convinced your growers that they

1203
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,460
self-assess on the amount of grain

1204
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:05,309
produced then you'd start seeing some

1205
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:07,230
serious money or even some percentage

1206
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:09,029
thereof so I think that if you want to

1207
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,320
see this kind of breeding generator

1208
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:12,330
revenue you're going to have to look for

1209
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,110
some other funding model other than what

1210
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:17,610
we currently have so with all that

1211
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:19,019
Marley world is where we try to keep in

1212
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:21,000
touch with the world please have a look

1213
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:23,250
at us thanks to the many people who have

1214
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,530
worked on the barley crew past and

1215
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:27,900
present and brought to you by these

1216
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:30,390
various funding agencies who have all

1217
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:32,250
given us funding over the years without

1218
00:48:30,389 --> 00:48:34,679
restriction and all of our germ plasm

1219
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:37,500
and data are in the public domain

1220
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:39,149
if it is not in t3 it's only because we

1221
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,980
just haven't gotten around to posting it

1222
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,160
yet

1223
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:47,329
thank you very much

1224
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:47,329
[Applause]

1225
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:54,480
for this

1226
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,960
opportunity for disease susceptibility

1227
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,659
in their sense

1228
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:04,320
yeah

1229
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:06,699
so the question was is there dis disease

1230
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:11,350
issues by going to

1231
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:11,349
so we are not a concern

1232
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:15,909
so that is not something

1233
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:23,789
so I don't want to say no

1234
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:27,000
we have not seen in this usage

1235
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:31,139
you do have to take extra care in

1236
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,139
threshing and processing that green

1237
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:37,760
condition breaks and you could ask the

1238
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:40,349
question why the white was the Masada

1239
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:43,170
barley returning opinion

1240
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:46,339
they're expecting and they probably made

1241
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:49,610
some dinner but they were also

1242
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:54,079
indicated some advantages in rulership

1243
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:54,079
modern support persistence

1244
00:49:56,849 --> 00:50:01,079
you get a mesh focus set up can that be

1245
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:03,358
used with covered party or is basically

1246
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:04,249
you know traditional setup works at

1247
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,440
every

1248
00:50:04,248 --> 00:50:09,629
dependability say yes efficient was mesh

1249
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,200
filtration they were being used widely

1250
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:15,690
today in fact all with cover partners so

1251
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:19,129
what it does is instead of making a kind

1252
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:19,130
of course of course but if

1253
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:26,599
you're also getting more out of a

1254
00:50:23,909 --> 00:50:28,588
textured and

1255
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:31,109
instead of having that fine powder

1256
00:50:28,588 --> 00:50:32,849
feminine 10% and cellulose which isn't

1257
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:36,139
getting anything it could be a hundred

1258
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:36,140
or start

1259
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,769
other question is

1260
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:48,778
now Bali has three layers 72

1261
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,360
is

1262
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:07,169
usually sometimes people but you know

1263
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:16,389
the question related to the structure

1264
00:51:12,989 --> 00:51:19,359
structure before they see the element

1265
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:21,699
layers have an effect not be responsible

1266
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,450
for the fact that it is the paper so I

1267
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:28,779
would hazard a that's a good position

1268
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:31,349
starting because it's not just the sheer

1269
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:34,630
lovin that inside eternity to find

1270
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:36,789
important is that higher included these

1271
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:39,039
higher than amazed by her health

1272
00:51:36,789 --> 00:51:42,960
attendants perhaps but it's the balance

1273
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:42,960
of course across plus

1274
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:52,980
so do know that gene expression the

1275
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:55,778
algorithm with signals from the interior

1276
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:58,380
information accounts for one enzyme

1277
00:51:55,778 --> 00:51:58,380
activity

1278
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:04,730
I can answer the question

1279
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:19,140
it's very different to select dirty with

1280
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:22,778
resistance like

1281
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:26,048
some pliers another possibly exactly yes

1282
00:52:22,778 --> 00:52:28,768
oh yes and Skeet Ulrich who is the

1283
00:52:26,048 --> 00:52:31,389
reader in Washington State's now retired

1284
00:52:28,768 --> 00:52:34,228
started educational program to target

1285
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:34,228
the same teens

1286
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:39,390
the successful Cafferty is clearing at

1287
00:52:37,498 --> 00:52:41,028
work on and they are the processing

1288
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:45,748
signals

1289
00:52:41,028 --> 00:52:48,409
so the question is that plus or minus in

1290
00:52:45,748 --> 00:52:48,409
the systems

1291
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:55,680
the best solution also in Australia now

1292
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,680
nice

1293
00:52:56,219 --> 00:53:00,809
in the northwest application they would

1294
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:03,300
be Sonique

1295
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:06,230
completion without the use of herbicides

1296
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,230
particularly

1297
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:11,050
Australia they needed an additional

1298
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:13,700
website in order to do some people

1299
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:16,070
unfortunately I guess that s where the

1300
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:18,189
science is one which means rather than

1301
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:20,590
all resistant so it's not

1302
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:23,130
sustainable

1303
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:23,130
alternative

1304
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:39,759
so right now the challenge we've had so

1305
00:53:37,929 --> 00:53:42,909
practice time we convince a current

1306
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,710
grower of barley cover garment focused

1307
00:53:42,909 --> 00:53:48,789
on first thing negative this is for the

1308
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:50,920
market and so in fact the first phase of

1309
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:55,119
this proposed project and putting

1310
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,730
together would be to produce large semi

1311
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,279
commercial nuts

1312
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:01,650
so that those artisan and industrial

1313
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,519
users can access and not be a party to

1314
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:07,349
the commercial bolts the whistle gears

1315
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:09,360
commercial foods and get those coming to

1316
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:11,569
the marketplace it's not that

1317
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:14,690
unfortunately I don't think it's just

1318
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:16,400
the music system that's working

1319
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:20,130
production

1320
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:23,690
in western is not a penalty so the top

1321
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:27,140
yielder and our breeding program

1322
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:28,880
the last two years has been indeed and

1323
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:30,799
so he was feeding the mr. Bartlett's

1324
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,309
Wiggles and the halt accounts for about

1325
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,310
ten percent

1326
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:45,160
so how do you ever have a naked party

1327
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:48,460
take anybody mystical and then how do

1328
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:50,649
you make a I turned it into a naked yes

1329
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:52,150
so naked part is how do you get naked

1330
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:54,269
Marley so you're simply saying is

1331
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:57,309
contain fat rasa in

1332
00:54:54,269 --> 00:55:00,099
everyone accelerate that process the

1333
00:54:57,309 --> 00:55:02,289
teens on other parts of seven days so

1334
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:04,900
it's not some super chromatic region

1335
00:55:02,289 --> 00:55:07,599
there's no that I know like my other

1336
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,930
jeans around it really carefully it's a

1337
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,009
pretty quick conversion program

1338
00:55:09,929 --> 00:55:14,980
we've done some of those kinds of

1339
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:17,610
projects and that's how we got the new

1340
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,610
gene into

1341
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,710
CRISPR probably not going to be

1342
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:28,719
permitted by

1343
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:30,608
since they need it's not just this kind

1344
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:32,889
of real simple plug-and-play system in

1345
00:55:30,608 --> 00:55:34,750
this department but his team under the

1346
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:36,879
pretty decent candidate because you

1347
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:39,820
could completely find induced mutants

1348
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,588
have been identified as specifically do

1349
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:46,019
lead to a loss of function where the

1350
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:46,019
scenes so we've got to be able to

1351
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:51,410
you've got a collaborative experiment

1352
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:53,639
ongoing just assuming it

1353
00:55:51,409 --> 00:55:56,369
related to this question so that when

1354
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:58,259
you makin a tea party you oughta try to

1355
00:55:56,369 --> 00:55:59,699
above them that you said that didn't

1356
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:03,600
good-looking that granny D is that

1357
00:55:59,699 --> 00:56:07,169
cursive letter time even the desert

1358
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:09,469
entity divers currently they have so a

1359
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:11,519
problem so in this unit but the

1360
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:13,219
composite that I mentioned that then

1361
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:16,259
forty parents

1362
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:18,750
te or so those who are India parties

1363
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:22,230
source from different Greek programs

1364
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:25,860
around so Eastwood fingers crossed then

1365
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:28,409
we have diversity and other positions in

1366
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:30,840
the genome recording to include them all

1367
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:32,879
we are kind of monophyletic in there's

1368
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,800
probably a single origin that that

1369
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,840
original mutation that led to the

1370
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:40,789
deletion routine so there could be

1371
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,789
things right in the vicinity

1372
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:47,400
and so that's where a couple of quick

1373
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:49,440
speeds are in a basket or at 70 Jill

1374
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,380
another turn pleasant to see what the

1375
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,608
parties were hiding random useful

1376
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,608
discriminatory mechanisms

1377
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:15,280
this has been a production of Cornell

1378
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:15,280
University on the web at Cornell edu
