1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:12,019
thank you Chris thanks for everybody for

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,269
being here so we're gonna talk about

5
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:15,769
berries now and most people like berries

6
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:16,730
which is of course a good thing I don't

7
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:19,039
have to

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,660
generally convince people to eat them

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,949
unlike some of the other products that

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,969
maybe somebody else might have been

11
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:24,969
talking about recently

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,409
so the berry breeding program at Cornell

13
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:35,359
has been around for a long time it was

14
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:37,339
one of the first breeding programs at

15
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,039
our station so I'm at the New York State

16
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,480
Agricultural Station Experiment Station

17
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,489
in Geneva a lot of people don't even

18
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45,229
know we exist which is something that's

19
00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:46,939
nice to tell people that were there

20
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:49,398
we've been there for a very long time

21
00:00:46,939 --> 00:01:00,108
and berries have always been a part of

22
00:00:49,399 --> 00:01:02,390
that program and our program is it's the

23
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:04,308
oldest breeding program in North America

24
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,870
we're pretty sure it's the oldest one in

25
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:08,120
the world but it's kind of hard to tell

26
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,409
sometimes when you get into the record

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,750
so we've been doing this for a long time

28
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,950
and we're pretty much that's when you

29
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,359
look at the other breeding programs

30
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,340
around the world and you look at their

31
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,680
records we're kind of our varieties of

32
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,490
foundational varieties all across the

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,530
world in other breeding programs as well

34
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:27,829
we primarily work in raspberry and

35
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,150
strawberry raspberry comes in a lot of

36
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,950
different colors that most people don't

37
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,109
know so of course red raspberries what

38
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,170
most people are familiar with but they

39
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:40,129
also come in black and purple and yellow

40
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:43,540
and blush and we've released varieties

41
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:45,949
in all of these colors over the years

42
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,840
some of the varieties you see in the

43
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,640
marketplace you wouldn't recognize why

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,890
because berries aren't sold by name

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,239
they're sold by name to the grower but

46
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,980
not to the consumer so a lot of people

47
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,890
don't even know that there are different

48
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:00,050
varieties if you go to the supermarket

49
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:03,769
what do you see you generally see big

50
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:06,109
red strawberry big red raspberries and

51
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:08,560
you don't realize because you don't see

52
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:10,699
varieties compared to each other

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,159
generally if you see differences in the

54
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,568
supermarket's organic and traditional or

55
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,340
conventional varieties are different

56
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,748
varieties usually and so maybe you can

57
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,400
tell the difference but normally you

58
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:20,389
can't tell the difference and the

59
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,709
industry has worked

60
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:26,269
hard to make it so because informing

61
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:30,170
consumers that every week is a new

62
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,850
variety it's very challenging it's the

63
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:34,369
same in strawberry so strawberries are

64
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:36,799
very regionally adapted so the varieties

65
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,659
that grow in California don't grow well

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,340
here the ones in Florida don't grow well

67
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,049
here are varieties don't grow well in

68
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,090
Southern California and you think about

69
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,400
the vast differences in climate you can

70
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,959
imagine that maybe these you know we

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,640
don't see the same trees growing in

72
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,409
different places will vary too the same

73
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,509
way you have to have varieties that are

74
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:56,739
adapted to where you live and where you

75
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:58,819
the climate and soils that you have

76
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,319
we've done a little bit with

77
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,889
blackberries and we're doing more with

78
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,939
blackberries because there is growing

79
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:06,889
availability and growing demand for

80
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:09,289
people to have blackberries and the

81
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:11,750
local market has been very sketchy for

82
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,489
us because of winter blackberries are

83
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,169
not particularly winter hardy and so now

84
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,879
we're working on varieties that can grow

85
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:21,199
in New York so that we can have local

86
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,489
blackberries as well most people don't

87
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,189
think New York when they think

88
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:27,500
strawberries four six in California

89
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:30,829
which of course 95% of the strawberries

90
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,650
in the US come from California but the

91
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:35,599
Northeast is the biggest region for very

92
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,969
consumption when you talk to companies

93
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,340
like Driscoll's the Northeast is their

94
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:41,780
market they love to sell in an or thesis

95
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,659
people like berries and they eat a lot

96
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,390
of them but that's at least four days

97
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:49,250
like truck to get here so the berries in

98
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:51,199
New York for strawberry start right now

99
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,209
so if you're interested in getting fresh

100
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,828
local strawberries now is the time to

101
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,930
start going to the farmers market they

102
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:58,820
are the first fruit to hit the market so

103
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,290
growers it's really important for

104
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:02,810
growers in New York they start getting

105
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:05,179
people to come out to the farms to come

106
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,860
to the stands to see some fresh product

107
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,719
and of course strawberries a trail of

108
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,970
strawberries right so it's a great way

109
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,379
to start the summer in New York

110
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:14,419
strawberries are the third leading fruit

111
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:20,478
crop so it is an important crops for

112
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:22,038
farmers in New York as well nationwide

113
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,319
were the sixth leading producer of

114
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:26,569
strawberries of course California

115
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,509
produces about five times more than the

116
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:33,529
rest of the country combined so six is

117
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:34,180
still a little bit down but California

118
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:36,698
has

119
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,620
much peaked in their production acreages

120
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:39,970
actually started to go down because they

121
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,168
just don't have any more space for

122
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:46,900
strawberries there's some labor issues

123
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:48,639
so we are looking for the possibility of

124
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:50,168
growing more strawberries in other parts

125
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,120
of the country including the Northeast

126
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:53,769
as strawberries do very well here

127
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,689
they're native there are strawberries

128
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:57,879
that grow while people have a tradition

129
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:01,089
of growing while are collecting wild

130
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,800
strawberries and raspberries of course

131
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:04,599
they're very small so it's a little

132
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,050
better to get them from a farmer so you

133
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,060
can pick them a little easier so of

134
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,129
course in the supermarket you have big

135
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,629
red raspberries big red strawberries of

136
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:15,610
course I have an interest in producing

137
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:17,860
big red ones as well this is one of our

138
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,038
varieties that is a big red raspberry

139
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,979
prince and giant fruit size and some of

140
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:27,728
these can and can be the size of a small

141
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:29,199
strawberry which is unusual but it's

142
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:31,598
really nice for pictures because it

143
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,610
fills containers really fast

144
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:35,829
people don't understand this as well so

145
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,020
berries are what are called filled

146
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:39,728
packed the berries you get in the

147
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:41,379
container in the supermarket we're put

148
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:43,629
in the container by the person who

149
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:47,918
picked it from the plant and no one else

150
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:49,569
touches it after that so how fast you

151
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,069
can get them into the container really

152
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:53,019
makes a difference for both the picker

153
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:53,949
and for the grower because they don't

154
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,129
have to pay as much to get them

155
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:59,228
harvested so of course we like big red

156
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:02,019
ones but competing with California big

157
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:04,329
red berries is most likely gonna be a

158
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:06,490
losing proposition their climate is so

159
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:07,899
perfect for growing berries that we need

160
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,348
to have some way to distinguish

161
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:13,629
ourselves from the California berries

162
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:16,029
you see in the supermarket and how we do

163
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:19,120
that generally is with flavor and

164
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:20,559
quality so this is our again another big

165
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,288
red berry but this is our Archer

166
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,939
strawberry that came out last year what

167
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:26,319
we find it's a little bit softer than

168
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:28,389
what you get in the supermarket because

169
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,899
we don't have to drive for days in a

170
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:35,050
semi to get it to market and that makes

171
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:37,029
a big difference both in quality and in

172
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,579
flavor because we can pick them much

173
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:41,439
riper and they don't have to be so firm

174
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:42,908
I get a lot of complaints people tell me

175
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,098
oh the strawberries in the supermarket

176
00:06:42,908 --> 00:06:46,430
they're so hard they don't taste like

177
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:49,069
anything

178
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,660
that's part of the modern system of if

179
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:53,930
you want to drive it across the country

180
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,310
from central Mexico in December you've

181
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,340
got to have some firmness to get it

182
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,899
there and so we develop varieties that

183
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:01,819
are not that firm they're a little

184
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:03,469
juicier you have more flavor and they

185
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:05,839
can get to market in the same day often

186
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,660
so they really are very fresh and so our

187
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,899
growers can differentiate themselves by

188
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,250
having a product that tastes better and

189
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:14,959
my colleagues at Driscoll's that I know

190
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,478
very well some of them actually are my

191
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,788
student former students they tell me in

192
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,860
the Northeast when June berries or

193
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:24,769
strawberries are coming in June in New

194
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,689
York their sales go down and that is

195
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:29,000
their peak season as well and if a

196
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:30,680
company like Driscoll's can notice that

197
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,689
people are buying local produce it

198
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,490
really it does open their eyes and

199
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,740
they're you know the market is there

200
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,960
because people are interested in having

201
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,960
a good quality product that is locally

202
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,000
grown one of the things we're doing is

203
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:46,069
working with protected agriculture so

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,779
you can see on the top are what we call

205
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:50,509
high tunnels these are about twelve to

206
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:51,978
fourteen feet high on the bottom we call

207
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:55,219
low tunnels they go over the strawberry

208
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:57,228
plant it's just to keep the rain off so

209
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,410
a raspberry plant a raspberry fruit

210
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:01,879
that's been rained on lasts about a day

211
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,490
to two days and you're in your

212
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,579
refrigerator because it has absorbed

213
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,720
some of that water and really softened a

214
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:11,329
raspberry that's never been rained on

215
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,520
can last seven to ten days in your suit

216
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:15,649
in your refrigerator so the difference

217
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,538
between two days and seven days is huge

218
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:19,698
when you're talking to shelf-life or a

219
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:22,129
product so just keeping the plants dry

220
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:24,830
and keeping the fruit dry it's a big big

221
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:26,629
advantage of course this year as the

222
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:28,519
rains have not stopped for us for the

223
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:29,689
most part it really has made a big

224
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,819
difference and we've just started

225
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,809
harvesting strawberries and normally in

226
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,689
a year like this when they've been

227
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:38,509
rained on 10 or 15 times bungle bungle

228
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,740
load gets really high the strawberries

229
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:41,658
are nice and dry under there

230
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,399
they're clean we haven't had to spray

231
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:47,569
fungicides and so everything it's

232
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,588
looking really good so this is one of

233
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,320
the things we've worked with my

234
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:53,839
colleague Marvin Pritz has also worked

235
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,129
on this quite a bit to show growers in

236
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,829
New York that we can grow strawberries

237
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:59,710
and raspberries and very high-quality by

238
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,269
doing some production practices

239
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,840
a little different than that we're used

240
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:06,699
to pretty much even in California the

241
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,710
raspberries are grown under tunnels to

242
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,750
keep them dry and so now with this kind

243
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,210
of technology we can have fresh berries

244
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,240
in New York somewhere being grown from

245
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,940
about mid-may until mid-november to

246
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,200
early December and people don't realize

247
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,960
that you can continue to get local

248
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,250
berries well into the fall and some of

249
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,170
the growers actually have problems

250
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,940
people don't believe them they're

251
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:29,079
picking raspberries in October and

252
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,670
they're putting them on the market and

253
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,740
they they can't believe that they

254
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:34,479
actually came from the local field and

255
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,970
they have to educate the grower there or

256
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,129
the consumer and show them pictures of

257
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,910
the field hood and the fruit being

258
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:45,429
picked raspberries are an interesting

259
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:46,809
crop because big and red is what you see

260
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:48,429
in the supermarket but what we would

261
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:50,500
like to do and what we're starting to do

262
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:52,959
is expand that palette to get people to

263
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,289
think about raspberries beyond that the

264
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,060
industry has been focused much more in

265
00:09:56,289 --> 00:10:00,399
the last 10 to 15 years on having them

266
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:01,289
available all the time pretty much now

267
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,980
though you go to the supermarket

268
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:05,620
strawberries raspberries blackberries

269
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,139
blueberries they're there all the time

270
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,879
year-round and now's the time where we

271
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:12,730
can expand that and start giving people

272
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,200
some different choices the big red ones

273
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,879
are always going to be there so now

274
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,860
let's look at specialty ones that come

275
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,720
around seasonally ones that taste a

276
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,480
little different of course there's

277
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,250
yellow blush black purple like I was

278
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,590
saying and we have varieties like that

279
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,870
and some of the flavors and those are

280
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,310
just outstanding right now where you're

281
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,320
going to find those are in the local

282
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:34,299
markets because some of the growers want

283
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,100
to differentiate themselves now from the

284
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:38,379
other local growers and have a product

285
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,240
that's a little different so we've

286
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:42,909
developed a few varieties in recent

287
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,580
years for crimson night were - - that

288
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:47,049
dark red color you can imagine the juice

289
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,090
and jam that you make out of something

290
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:52,029
like this it's really outstanding the

291
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:54,610
frozen product there is a really nice it

292
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:56,289
has a really sweet flavor the blush one

293
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,070
we call that apricot in the breeding

294
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:02,409
world but the best-tasting raspberry

295
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,560
that I have it really is confuses people

296
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:07,509
because it never turns red when you

297
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,489
freeze it it turns pink it's very

298
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:10,720
interesting variety but it's really

299
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,940
interesting to the growers as well

300
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,100
because even if people don't buy it they

301
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,680
come over to their market just to see it

302
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,720
or to try it and then they might just

303
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,729
buy red ones but it starts a

304
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,800
conversation with the grower and the

305
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,350
consumer so they can start to learn

306
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:28,809
about this and we see this very

307
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,720
interesting to the the gardening world

308
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:33,369
the home gardener as well because they

309
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,009
know more about it because they've been

310
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,720
growing it themselves and you know I

311
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:39,939
grew up on a farm where we always had a

312
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,620
garden and gardeners like to brag to

313
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,970
each other about whatever it is they

314
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,490
have that their neighbor doesn't have

315
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,610
and so this kind of stuff really brings

316
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:52,240
a conversation about what they might be

317
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:54,310
growing so this is our we have a purple

318
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,560
strawberry as well it ripens to a red

319
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:58,869
wine color the juice is just as dark as

320
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,489
you see on the outside we're selling

321
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,750
that to Burpee because the homeowners

322
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,669
are really interested something

323
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,830
different and the flavor on that is just

324
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:07,439
just outstanding you won't see that in a

325
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,030
supermarket probably for a while because

326
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,490
nobody knows how to market it exactly

327
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,839
but but the home gardener already knows

328
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,960
because they know what tastes good and

329
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,340
so that's what they're looking for now

330
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,810
people don't realize that strawberries

331
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,670
can come in other colors there's white

332
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:23,079
strawberries as well or starting to see

333
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:24,969
those in the marketplace a little bit

334
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,280
this is a pine berry type you might see

335
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,779
that occasionally if you ever go on

336
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,490
YouTube and look at white strawberries

337
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:32,980
in Japan you'll be amazed at what

338
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,299
they're doing it's it's a little it's a

339
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,180
little crazy they're selling them

340
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:39,459
individually individual berries and

341
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:41,319
they're packed in a nice soft container

342
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,320
and they sell them as gifts and special

343
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,629
occasions it's pretty wild what they're

344
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,320
what what people will do if they have

345
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:51,730
too much money on their hand but growers

346
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,810
