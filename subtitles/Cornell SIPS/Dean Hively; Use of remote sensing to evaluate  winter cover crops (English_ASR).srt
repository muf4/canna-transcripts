1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,340
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,570
so greetings everybody my name is Dean

4
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,210
I've been working with a combination of

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,000
USDA AG Research Service and US

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:19,900
Geological Survey in the Chesapeake Bay

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,559
for about 12 years now finished my PhD

8
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:25,599
up at Cornell 12 years ago and headed on

9
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:27,698
down and started working on remote

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,710
sensing at winter cover crops so I

11
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:32,559
really appreciate this kind of a

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,448
conference because it allows the folks

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,238
who have got their fingers in the dirt

14
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:39,579
doing field experiments to interact with

15
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:41,109
kind of the big picture of what's

16
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:43,480
happening in the landscape with

17
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:45,579
implementation trends and we've been

18
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:48,849
working in a few different states to try

19
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:52,600
to work those things out so looking

20
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:55,090
forward to the interactions have a whole

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,760
slew of partners working with soil

22
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,379
conservation districts on project in New

23
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,259
York I'll be talking about upper

24
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:04,750
Susquehanna a project with serdika and

25
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:12,340
Pennsylvania and a lot of partnership

26
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:14,349
with Marin Department of Ag I work for

27
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,728
USGS so whenever you see the disclaimer

28
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:19,809
it means it hasn't gone through peer

29
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:23,349
review yet Chesapeake Bay Brian just

30
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:25,689
gave us a nice look at it water quality

31
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:28,030
being the primary issue and so winter

32
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:30,219
cover crops although you know how many

33
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,409
benefits they have really from a

34
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:34,750
Chesapeake Bay Program perspective its

35
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:37,179
nutrient and sediment reduction right so

36
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,030
provide cover over the soil surface to

37
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:42,969
reduce sediment loss and sequester

38
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,709
nitrogen and living biomass to keep it

39
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,989
green over the winter and reduce

40
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:49,359
nitrogen losses and so it's really

41
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:52,109
promoted by a combination of incentives

42
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,728
particularly in Maryland or through NRCS

43
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:56,769
regulation for example highly erodible

44
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:59,200
land you can plant a cover crop the new

45
00:01:56,769 --> 00:02:02,049
earth can beat your t factor for your

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,020
erosion prevention through extension so

47
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,500
just good sense farmers talking to each

48
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:11,590
other working on soil health and and

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,870
economic benefits of winter cover crops

50
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,969
what you see in a state like Maryland

51
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,569
where there incentivization for

52
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:21,729
different programs is on performed on

53
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:24,189
farm performance is highly variable so

54
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:26,229
going from upper left which is probably

55
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:29,229
a rye crop planted with dairy manure

56
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:32,109
getting a nice thick biomass down to an

57
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:34,719
aerial seeded field that was cost shared

58
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,030
by the farmers and happened to fail that

59
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,609
year aerial seeding on a high residue

60
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,640
situation with poor rainfall that year

61
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,799
got zero biomass so that's the

62
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,809
environment we're working in and we're

63
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:49,810
trying to take a perspective we're

64
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:52,629
combining remote sensing satellite

65
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,569
imagery airborne imagery of measuring

66
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:57,729
vegetation on the soil surface combined

67
00:02:55,568 --> 00:03:00,518
with collaboration with ongoing

68
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:02,439
Extension programs so knowledge of where

69
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,500
the fields are in Maryland what's going

70
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:08,378
on on them or other data is in other

71
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,969
states so we're we're thinking with this

72
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:14,979
toolkit we can really start quantifying

73
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:17,310
the environmental benefits of cover

74
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,310
crops

75
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,629
one of our main tools is satellite

76
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:25,419
imagery on the left you see a Landsat

77
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:27,490
image of the entire Eastern Shore set

78
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:29,979
within that Talbot County one of our

79
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,600
focus areas with some smaller imagery

80
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:34,989
spot that I obtained through US

81
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,840
Geological Survey so really every image

82
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:39,969
is a snapshot in time we tried to

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,479
collect imagery around December January

84
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:46,569
when the crops have gone dormant for the

85
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:49,239
winter and then again come back in April

86
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:52,180
or so to look at springtime growth

87
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,760
before it's terminated in the spring

88
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,090
you

89
00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:00,000
if you look at the soil surface through

90
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,939
a satellite which sees infrared as well

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,098
as our visible bands you can see

92
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,408
vegetation pretty clearly so the bright

93
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:10,500
red here is reflectance in the

94
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:13,769
near-infrared so the redder fields have

95
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,228
higher biomass you can see pine trees

96
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:19,500
here having a high biomass you can see a

97
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:21,719
bear field and then various degrees of

98
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,620
vegetation cover within the farm

99
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,490
landscape

100
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,918
if you take a particular farm and this

101
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,840
is a collaborating farm I work on then

102
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,939
you can start really thinking about crop

103
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,039
rotations and you can think about

104
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:38,079
management here in Maryland we have a

105
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,210
lot of center pivot irrigation so you

106
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:44,198
can see fields chopped up with crop

107
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:47,589
rotations and then through collaboration

108
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,900
we obtain access to knowledge of what's

109
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:53,049
going on in these fields so this farm is

110
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:56,319
enrolled most of its land in cover crop

111
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,439
program they grow a lot of barley so any

112
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:03,099
field outlined in yellow is barley field

113
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:05,139
so for a particular field we might know

114
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,689
that is barley planted in two and a half

115
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:10,090
bushels a hectare using a no-till drill

116
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:12,459
planted on September 14th following corn

117
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:14,228
so a lot of information about what's

118
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,449
going on on that field with that cover

119
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:18,759
crop and then we can put a remote

120
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:22,300
sensing measurement to them and say that

121
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:25,089
management resulted in six hundred and

122
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,970
seventy kilograms per hectare pounds per

123
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:30,129
acre of biomass for example right and

124
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:33,160
then we do feel the same thing to back

125
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:35,589
that up so that's our general strategy

126
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,510
we collaborate with soil conservation

127
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:39,310
districts make it up to a lot of farms

128
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:42,129
to click the field sampling data that

129
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,439
Brian was talking about and then try to

130
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:46,779
promote adaptive management giving

131
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:50,168
information about what's going on on the

132
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:53,589
different fields so I like saying we

133
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:55,930
have two different strategies in a state

134
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:57,699
like Pennsylvania or New York where we

135
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,610
don't have access to knowledge of what's

136
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:03,038
going on the fields we use public

137
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,650
datasets so we're using satellite

138
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,409
imagery look at ground cover we're using

139
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:11,168
the cropland data layer to look at crop

140
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,750
type of the previous summer and then

141
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:16,478
we're combining those to look at say

142
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:20,649
what's the ground cover on corn fields

143
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:22,839
and Cayuga County New York right the

144
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:25,538
first work here's an example back in

145
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:27,759
talbot of an image that's been shaded

146
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:30,370
with the vegetation index or brighter

147
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:34,509
colors here as bear fields darker is

148
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,470
more vegetation we think about threshold

149
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,750
and

150
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:41,050
different biomass categories looking at

151
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,410
really minimum low medium high biomass

152
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:48,370
with corresponding groundcovers

153
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:51,010
thresholds and then we can translate our

154
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,509
image of the landscape into looking at

155
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:55,509
where the bare fields where the high

156
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:57,370
vegetation fields are then we combine

157
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:59,050
that with the cropland data layer if

158
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:03,280
you're not familiar with this this is a

159
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:06,579
USDA Nass product available 2008 to

160
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,649
present and they use imagery analysis to

161
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:11,680
look at crop rotation so here mainly

162
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:14,409
corn and soybean and wheat fields grown

163
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,650
in this county so by combining those we

164
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:20,530
can develop say a map of all of the corn

165
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:22,719
fields in Talbot County including the

166
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:28,269
low biomass medium and high biomass

167
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:32,080
fields just looking at vegetation in the

168
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:34,359
landscape by crop type and we've

169
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,839
developed a tool that will take the 10

170
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,629
top land uses in a county it will

171
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,369
calculate the area of corn six and a

172
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,040
half percent of the county's corn and

173
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:47,740
then looking at these biomass categories

174
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,790
so 50% of the corn fields have very

175
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:56,650
little biomass 30% 28% a little bit of

176
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:59,950
biomass though this amount 13% medium

177
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:02,859
and 9% high biomass right so somewhat

178
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:05,409
arbitrary where we said those points but

179
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,650
we use calibration data to try to get it

180
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,480
some environmental thresholds you can

181
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:12,939
look at it's similar patterns for

182
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,330
soybeans or for other crops in the

183
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:19,240
watershed and this is an example right

184
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:21,519
so by combining these data sets we're

185
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,900
looking at Talbot County Maryland we're

186
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:28,180
looking at 2008 through 213 from the

187
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:31,509
cropland data there we can see that the

188
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:35,529
acres of corn land have stayed fairly

189
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:38,918
stable with a little bump in 2010 we can

190
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:41,139
look at cover crop this is just numbered

191
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:46,139
fields not acres sorry this is number of

192
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:46,139
fields this is cover crop following corn

193
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:51,730
so 50

194
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:53,738
five percent of corn fields were planted

195
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,589
to cover crops under the subsidy program

196
00:08:53,739 --> 00:09:00,399
you can see between 28 and 2013 that

197
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:03,549
number climb to 80% Maryland cover crop

198
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,589
subsidies increasing over time 80% of

199
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:10,619
corn land in this particular County in

200
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:23,799
2013 by higher than 56 80 on corn fields

201
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:25,629
other 56 overall crops well that's what

202
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:27,249
this bottom graph is all about right so

203
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:29,769
this is just the number of fields

204
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:44,048
enrollment program this is the

205
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:46,360
performance that's a nice fine

206
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:47,798
distinction of when a farmer got

207
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,209
enrolled in the program and that would

208
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:52,958
be really interesting to see if the

209
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:55,118
farmers I've not thought about looking

210
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:58,238
at that what we can look at is within

211
00:09:55,119 --> 00:10:01,528
each of these corn cover crop fields

212
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:04,660
what's going on and you can see in 2009

213
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:06,428
the brown is minimal biomass the dark

214
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:09,278
green is high biomass and you can see

215
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:11,499
over this time we have shifted this is

216
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,558
all cornfields in the county right and

217
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:18,149
so as the cover crops have gone up we've

218
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:20,980
shifted towards a lot more biomass right

219
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:23,230
so this is one example of an announced

220
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:27,668
as you can do and it kind of using this

221
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:29,470
toolkit I did this for five counties in

222
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:32,230
Pennsylvania and collaboration with

223
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,759
sword Waker we published this a couple

224
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,129
years ago so I'll run through it real

225
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:40,178
quick but basically looking at these

226
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:42,249
counties they had a program called

227
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:45,789
without carrot or stick so not using

228
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:50,649
incentives but really just the farmers

229
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:53,110
trying to promote silage cover crops

230
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,909
following corn silage harvest and they

231
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,980
were very active in the landscape from

232
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:59,528
tending to a twenty ten to twelve and so

233
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,480
along with Seward and NIF with funding

234
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:03,299
we started thinking about well can we

235
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,310
see changes

236
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:08,049
their extension looking at the four

237
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:11,109
counties you can see the crop type

238
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:14,169
distribution and just get them straight

239
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,240
to the results for years and Berks in

240
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:19,449
York County you can see percentage of

241
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,789
bare soil decrease from 75 percent to

242
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:24,400
around 50 percent over that same time

243
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:26,610
period Lancaster and Lebanon have a

244
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,799
higher intensity of cover cropping and

245
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:32,680
varicella decreasing from 50 to 25

246
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:36,039
percent within these we saw some really

247
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:38,799
clear trends over time we didn't say

248
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:42,250
well let's make sure this isn't some bad

249
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:44,740
walk with warmer years over time and so

250
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,289
we did look as accumulated Grug degrees

251
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:51,190
by the time our images were collected

252
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:55,179
fairly stable some other analyses also

253
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:57,480
but really you know between 700 800 900

254
00:11:55,179 --> 00:12:03,009
growing degrees over this time period

255
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:05,700
making us come to detecting increased

256
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:05,700
cover cropping

257
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,360
that's Pennsylvania just give me a

258
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,549
bird's-eye view some of the different

259
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,419
research we're doing so feel free to

260
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:18,079
look that up three counties in New York

261
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:21,750
just did that this summer so we're in

262
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,310
Cayuga County right now I did analysis

263
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:26,580
for K you last week it's not in this

264
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:29,159
graphic but looking at three counties in

265
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,710
New York looking at satellite imagery

266
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:33,449
what we find up here is that it's tough

267
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,000
to get but winter imagery it's either

268
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:41,070
cloudy or it's snowing a lot of the

269
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,679
winter comes over every 16 days so what

270
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:46,500
we found best for this analysis was a

271
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,779
spring time analysis every April in most

272
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,600
years we would get a clear image

273
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:54,329
so here's Seneca County we're down here

274
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,460
in Ithaca and between-the-legs is one of

275
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,950
the most productive grain areas of the

276
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,350
southern tier of New York you can see

277
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:04,440
crop type distribution a lot of alfalfa

278
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:07,379
corn and soybeans looking at the

279
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,200
satellite analysis for example of the

280
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:14,009
corn land within the county a lot of

281
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,690
corn land and here is a trend analysis

282
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:18,360
so a little bit different than our last

283
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,690
graphs but the colors are the same this

284
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,960
is corn going from 0 to 100% of corn

285
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,150
land so you can see not a lot of trend

286
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:33,150
over time in these four years we're

287
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:34,829
analyzing going from 73 60s 76 80% soil

288
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,860
without much of vegetation

289
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:44,009
you see 2009-10 had the most cover crop

290
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:46,350
well I'll say the something else they're

291
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:48,090
rotating into after corn all we know is

292
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,850
that there's wintertime vegetation

293
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:54,899
following corn this is a year with warm

294
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:57,420
temperatures in little high biomass but

295
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,819
no real trends over time looking at

296
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:02,370
Delaware County downstate near the cans

297
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,740
no reservoir a lot of just little

298
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,480
riverbank farms and finds up in the

299
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,450
hillsides not that much corn land

300
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,700
they've been extending cover crop or

301
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,250
extending conservation practices for

302
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,320
quite a while and we're seeing a higher

303
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,259
percent vegetation on these fields with

304
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:25,590
only 30 to 40%

305
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:28,519
vegetated fields but no real trends over

306
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,519
time here either

307
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,990
as a nuance the fields done they're very

308
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:34,429
small and I'm a little worried we're

309
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,870
getting mixed pixels with the edge of

310
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:38,750
the fields and they might not actually

311
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,519
have that option we're going posterity

312
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,490
to try to figure that out

313
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:47,329
third County Cortland County of broad

314
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:49,909
distribution of farmland and again we

315
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,920
had a better series of imagery here some

316
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:55,039
more years of analysis with clear

317
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:59,829
imagery in April and the heceta bouncing

318
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:02,480
around 66% 2010-11 operative cover crops

319
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,509
2014-15 was a terrible year for come

320
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,519
across late corn harvest wet fall very

321
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:09,830
few farmers able to plant cover crops

322
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,939
and we did see that that we really are

323
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:16,700
seeing in farming practices on cover

324
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:20,540
crop abduction not seeing any real

325
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:23,060
trends over coming so unlike

326
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:26,919
Pennsylvania we're finding some

327
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:29,419
consistent differences between counties

328
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:32,329
look at kind of the percent of corn

329
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:34,849
fields or other crop type fields that

330
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:37,520
are have winter vegetation following

331
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,279
their harvest but not really seeing any

332
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,870
clear tends over time so that's our

333
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:46,279
initial analysis for New York

334
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:52,789
I'm written up yet so that's what we do

335
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:55,189
in a state where we have the data for

336
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:58,099
all of the cover crop enrollment for the

337
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,840
entire state Brian was presenting some

338
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,570
of the trends from that data set and

339
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:06,129
then in particular counties we've worked

340
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,129
with the ages where they're actually

341
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,980
allow us to analyze the biomass and

342
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,669
they're moving toward doing that for the

343
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,230
entire state as part of the grant work

344
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:21,529
that we've done with Maryland so we're

345
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:24,139
working remote sensing analysis for the

346
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:27,079
entire state in the meantime we're

347
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:28,699
really focusing on Talbot County you

348
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,970
recall I was talking about you know

349
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:35,060
field boundaries per planted the

350
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:37,220
particular crops this farmer released

351
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:39,139
this information which is why I can show

352
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,700
it to you but I wouldn't show it for the

353
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:42,169
rest of the county what was going on

354
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,690
except an aggregate

355
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:46,849
form you can see the number of fields

356
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,130
planted to cover crops over time again

357
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:52,070
increasing over time and Talbot County

358
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:53,990
and we're able to really look at every

359
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,778
field and I already presented this type

360
00:16:53,990 --> 00:17:00,049
of data the other thing we can get into

361
00:16:56,778 --> 00:17:02,269
is really what are the agronomic factors

362
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:04,938
in the subsidy program that are leaning

363
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:07,669
towards variable success in cover crops

364
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:09,199
and you know what they are really from

365
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:11,959
your own knowledge of cover crops is

366
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,839
planting method its previous crop its

367
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:18,558
nitrogen soils weather planting date a

368
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:21,379
lot of these factors add up to determine

369
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:24,289
health of the cover crop performance of

370
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,809
the cover crops here's looking at

371
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:28,700
planting date right so Brian showed some

372
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:31,460
interesting data this is a different way

373
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:34,029
of looking at it this is the number of

374
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:37,789
fields planted within the early late

375
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:40,910
planting category so early is this green

376
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:45,319
line and that's planted before October

377
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:47,450
15th take-home message the only way

378
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:50,389
you're going to get more than 15

379
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:53,390
kilograms of nitrogen in a cover crop is

380
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:59,419
early and there's a big peak of late

381
00:17:53,390 --> 00:18:00,259
planted fields that really so from my

382
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:05,270
point of view

383
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:08,569
let's give feedback to the farmer so

384
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:12,230
that we get more environmental benefit

385
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:17,149
from our subsidies this graph is the

386
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:19,789
accumulated biomass on this access so

387
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:22,700
this is about a ton per acre of thousand

388
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:26,629
kilograms per hectare and the gray is

389
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:28,490
growing degrees before December 31st so

390
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:33,020
if you plant September first

391
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:34,429
you get mmm a hundred grow or whatever I

392
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:36,679
don't know the number but you get this

393
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:38,540
many growing degrees and the grind

394
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:42,440
agrees to Windell over time right if you

395
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:44,808
plant November third very low growing

396
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,360
degree accumulation the Green Line is

397
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:50,000
the average biomass for every crop in

398
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,889
Talbot County planted on that date and

399
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,509
so you see a very tight relationship

400
00:18:51,890 --> 00:19:00,470
between planting day growing and biomass

401
00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:03,559
on em dan uary third gender six is when

402
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:06,950
this image would analysis it well you

403
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:10,970
see a little bump here in mid-october

404
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:13,069
that's we think associated with folks

405
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:17,210
who are planting wheat for harvest so

406
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:19,460
they're a lot more drilled cover crops

407
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,319
at that point but this is the type of

408
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,759
analysis you can get to you when you

409
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:24,689
start looking at all the cover crop

410
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:27,829
fields and Counting

411
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:31,080
you can also break it up by other

412
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:34,339
factors so looking at the differences in

413
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:39,179
species number of fields enrolled

414
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:41,459
biomass and nitrogen content this is

415
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,740
just for one year you look at this over

416
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,019
six years you throw my livers into the

417
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,759
factor it's a lot more complicated and

418
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:50,970
I'm looking forward to Brian's methods

419
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,220
to help kind of factors in our

420
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:56,160
enrollment data set you can see

421
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,500
difference in nitrogen content related

422
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,050
to planting day and then relating to

423
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,640
planting method with you know science of

424
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:05,009
proving the obvious you already know

425
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,400
that if you drill and get good seats or

426
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:10,109
contact you're going to get better

427
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,180
biomass and nitrogen accumulation than

428
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:14,519
if you're broadcasting by and large but

429
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,560
we're looking at this as a census of all

430
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,779
the fields in the county so it becomes a

431
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,599
fairly powerful tool

432
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:25,639
and then you can translate this again

433
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:28,558
into dollars per pound of nitrogen

434
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,240
sequestered and you can see that early

435
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,369
planted rise is a pretty good deal for

436
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,259
the taxpayers the compared to late

437
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:36,329
planted wheat and if you think about

438
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:40,079
that nitrogen being recycled back to the

439
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:44,269
field for the farmer better deal then

440
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,269
you can balance that out with incentive

441
00:20:48,980 --> 00:21:45,630
payment covers the ground and then

442
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:49,769
saturate and you can't tell the

443
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:54,030
difference between 500 kilograms mass

444
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:55,859
and 3,000 right you can tell it up to

445
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:59,970
about a thousand up to by the ton per

446
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:01,558
acre you can that's okay we can measure

447
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:06,750
well through the critical environmental

448
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:10,139
threshold and it's similar with percent

449
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,880
ground cover between 0% and 80% ground

450
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:15,210
cover we can just stick with pretty well

451
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,580
and not do that we can just say so

452
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,690
you're absolutely right and we'll be

453
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:24,179
focusing on that with more analysis

454
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:27,029
just to find all kind of conclusions of

455
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:40,980
what we see in the landscape the very

456
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:46,319
high biomass fields tend to be cover

457
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:50,059
crop on a heavily more nutrient

458
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,960
application is it a great

459
00:22:50,059 --> 00:23:01,309
environmentally we've sampled some

460
00:22:51,960 --> 00:23:03,779
fields where they're still half of that

461
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:06,359
so there's a time for nutrient

462
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:08,759
management plant come in in combination

463
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:11,459
with to really solve these problems so

464
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,529
his green are always better you know I

465
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,380
think there's a happy medium from a

466
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:19,609
nitrogen leaching point of view we also

467
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,750
see a lot of nutrient limited cover crop

468
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:24,329
importantly not because of a late

469
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:27,269
planting or aerial seeding could be

470
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:32,399
early planted drilled dry still doing

471
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:34,500
poorly because there's no easy mmm the

472
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:40,920
cover crop purist might say well

473
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:42,720
fertilize it and you get more benefit is

474
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:47,759
there a lower threshold for cover crop

475
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,799
success again yes he want to achieve a

476
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,849
certain amount of biomass by certain

477
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:53,309
amount of time to have a good

478
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:55,799
environmental benefit but that nitrogen

479
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:59,089
limitation becomes a kind of a sticking

480
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,089
point and we cannot remote

481
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:06,849
how do we define success successful

482
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:11,769
strategies I think fitly the climate and

483
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:13,990
the farming system with good niches for

484
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:17,200
healthy productive cover crops that's

485
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:19,150
how we define success in terms of simple

486
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,910
nitrogen I was just talking about and

487
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:25,570
there may be some critical thresholds 4%

488
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:27,490
of soil coverage you know combination of

489
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:29,339
factors working in the in the

490
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:32,740
environment experimentation innovation

491
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:35,709
adoption and that getting back to carrot

492
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:38,500
or stick I think you know a combination

493
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:41,350
of incentive regulation and just playing

494
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,659
off farm to farm transfer and growing

495
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:45,629
the practice of healthy cover crops is

496
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:47,860
what's going to get us to the

497
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,559
environmental end points of a lot of

498
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:51,879
healthy cover crops in the landscape

499
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:57,069
remote sensing is one tool in the

500
00:24:51,880 --> 00:25:07,000
toolbox it's kind of a broad brush I can

501
00:24:57,069 --> 00:25:09,428
look at a field and say there's going on

502
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,220
but we have a good tool here so if

503
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:14,798
anybody's interested in your County or

504
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,529
looking at particular farms looking at

505
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,779
spatial variation and field thinking

506
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:22,119
about you know your your variability or

507
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:24,879
you're working with the sustainable AG

508
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:29,229
lab folks as they together come across

509
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,059
growth models combining the cover crop

510
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:36,339
growth models but the remote sensing

511
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:38,700
will be good further development that's

512
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:38,699
what I got

513
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:46,180
[Applause]

514
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:55,969
so for a few years we were going out

515
00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:00,679
October December April on the same field

516
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:03,048
we were sampling nitrogen and you see a

517
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:05,298
fair amount of residual nitrogen you see

518
00:26:03,048 --> 00:26:07,369
about half of it collected by the

519
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:10,058
covercraft and the other half lost below

520
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:12,589
the top foot and really by springtime

521
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:15,528
you've lost all your nitrogen from their

522
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:16,879
top foot food in our brown sandy soils

523
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:19,490
fairly high ranked ball in the

524
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,278
wintertime you lose the nitrogen under

525
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:25,278
the surface soil and feel we've also

526
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:27,259
seen evidence of the cover crops going

527
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,538
down and catching that pulse from deeper

528
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:32,240
soil I'm bringing it up where the amount

529
00:26:29,538 --> 00:26:35,359
of nitrogen in a cover crop in the

530
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,250
spring time was more than the amount of

531
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:42,678
nitrogen in the top for the soil in

532
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:45,679
October from growing into the springs

533
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:51,220
awesome I think that the March 1st

534
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:53,330
cutoff date was historic from early

535
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:58,909
organization of the cover crop program

536
00:26:53,329 --> 00:27:00,710
to feat bit of the farmers need and

537
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:02,450
they're basically saying well after

538
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,730
March 1st you can do where you want I

539
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,288
think it's up to the extension folks to

540
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,240
say they finally there's a real soil

541
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:17,569
health benefit from going longer maybe

542
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:19,909
don't need Maryland to pay there are

543
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:23,298
farmers who talked about ride getting

544
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:35,509
away from the spring and not know you

545
00:27:23,298 --> 00:27:36,798
guys who are really I'm happy to bring

546
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:38,509
that type of information

547
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,668
Tamara London if we're looking at the

548
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:42,349
spring time then we look at that remote

549
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:46,120
sensing gets tricky in the spring

550
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:48,558
because certain fields get terminated I

551
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:50,119
really have to you can't look at the

552
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,759
whole landscape you have to start

553
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:54,709
looking at termination dates and follow

554
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:57,829
fields as they go from green to yellow

555
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:00,278
to brown to plant the green again with

556
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:00,278
the corn

557
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:14,899
that is your question and there's a lot

558
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:23,658
of mineralization happens in the

559
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:28,548
springtime they're not resisting I'm

560
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:35,320
sure they'll be open though look at

561
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:35,319
nitrogen content yeah the USGS we like

562
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:43,788
we've used them a little bit

563
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,639
experimentally I'm based out of Beltran

564
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:52,460
Research Station and we're within the DC

565
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:54,048
no-fly boundaries really for me I'm

566
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,179
looking at the watershed landscape

567
00:28:54,048 --> 00:29:00,229
approach I'm sticking to satellites and

568
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:02,450
then satellites accuracy then yes the

569
00:29:00,229 --> 00:29:05,119
red edge is very useful for measuring

570
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:08,598
nitrogen content when we're doing most

571
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:10,728
of this work up to 2013 we're using spot

572
00:29:08,598 --> 00:29:13,069
imagery which only has red green blue

573
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:15,649
near for red and so we're not able to

574
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:18,019
measure nitrogen content now we can use

575
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:19,668
worldview 3 we can look at crop residue

576
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:22,368
I'm not praying about it but we have a

577
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:26,509
whole project that's looking at residue

578
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:28,819
intelligence and then yeah you can start

579
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:31,159
measuring the nitrogen percent nitrogen

580
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:33,739
content of Pro crops with sensors

581
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:36,289
especially with proximal sensors things

582
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:38,450
that you're flying over the field

583
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:44,658
maybe that's where we go with the next

584
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:46,548
five years in terms of the biomass

585
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:49,309
saturation I think that's always going

586
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:57,558
to saturate but being able to measure

587
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:59,778
the nitrogen content along with you know

588
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:02,509
that nitrogen content smartening varies

589
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:05,858
between percent and a half and five

590
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,858
percent depending on stage

591
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:15,360
thanks everybody over the rest of the

592
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:15,359
conference please you know

593
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:34,749
this has been a production of Cornell

594
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:34,749
University on the web at Cornell edu
