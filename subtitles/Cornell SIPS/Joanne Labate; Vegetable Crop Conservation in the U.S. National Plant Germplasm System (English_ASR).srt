1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,839
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,839
University

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:12,859
thank you all for coming and for this

4
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:17,719
opportunity to talk to you about what we

5
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:20,179
do in Geneva at the PGR you I have quite

6
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,479
a bit of material in my talk I try to

7
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:24,679
touch on a lot of different things

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,500
because there are a lot of different

9
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:29,960
things that we do and so I try to tell

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,640
you a little bit about everything so

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,700
I'll talk about the national plant

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,340
germplasm system and P GRU and what we

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,410
do at P GRU I'll also talk a little bit

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,650
about the green global database where

15
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:45,890
you can order germ plasm I get a lot of

16
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:48,259
questions about that and I'll talk a

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,759
little bit about the molecular research

18
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:55,939
that we've done and also about our

19
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:58,339
outreach activities so the MGP s it's a

20
00:00:55,939 --> 00:01:01,250
cooperative effort by the state federal

21
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,640
in other organizations to preserve

22
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,739
genetic diversity and the idea is that

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,368
genetic uniformity increases

24
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:13,669
vulnerability to pass the stress and

25
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:17,590
disease so MGP s provides access to

26
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,549
genetic diversity so that breeders

27
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,939
researchers can bring forth new

28
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:26,899
varieties that can tolerate or resist

29
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:29,689
these diseases and stresses so we serve

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,670
science and education we acquire

31
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:35,450
preservative evaluate document and

32
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:38,840
distribute plant germplasm and this is

33
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:45,320
just to show you it is a national system

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:48,950
and spread throughout different drawing

35
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,839
regions so that for example the crops

36
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,270
that we have in Geneva New York are

37
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:58,939
things that do well in our temperate

38
00:01:53,269 --> 00:02:01,280
climate as far as MPTs as of October

39
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:05,419
2017

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:09,679
there were over 15,000 species conserved

41
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:12,500
and over half of five hundred eighty

42
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,030
three thousand half-a-million accessions

43
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,128
in an accession you can think of as a

44
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:21,348
population it's a genetically unique

45
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:25,280
stock or population or clone of a tree

46
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:29,018
that is conserved as an entity so as far

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,449
as samples of seed or clones distributed

48
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:34,670
around a quarter of a million per year

49
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:37,268
throughout the whole system and about 30

50
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:41,750
percent of those are international and

51
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:45,259
that's just to show you that there are

52
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,930
29 repositories see crops Clara crops

53
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:50,209
genetic stocks and where are some of the

54
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:57,010
larger repositories and collections are

55
00:02:50,209 --> 00:03:00,259
and that once that list on the side is

56
00:02:57,009 --> 00:03:03,469
from the grand global database if

57
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:06,709
anybody ever wanted to look that up so

58
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:11,408
as far as in Geneva the secrets

59
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:15,669
repository we hold around 200 taxa in

60
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:15,668
over 12,000 accessions

61
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:26,120
and our major sea crops are listed here

62
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:29,840
onion celery different brassicas winter

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:35,780
squash buckwheat Tomatoes our largest

64
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:39,049
collection and radish in 2016 we

65
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:43,669
distributed close to 8000 samples of

66
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:45,438
seed and 254 orders and so I'll talk

67
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:48,469
about some of the activities when we

68
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:53,000
acquire germ plasm the purpose is to

69
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:54,919
fill gaps in our collections if people

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,079
go on collecting trips if those are

71
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:01,930
administered by the plant exchange

72
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:04,310
office in Maryland and they do

73
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,040
administer domestic and foreign plant

74
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,530
explorations and they review proposals

75
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:12,228
and I usually review some of these

76
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,598
proposals every year and rank them and

77
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:17,180
to support xe2 and institute

78
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:22,449
conservation of crop plants and wild

79
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:26,360
relatives for example for PGR you

80
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:29,300
the room was a collection in 2002 of

81
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,060
tomatillo and the former curator dr.

82
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,050
Robertson and dr. Todd vision from the

83
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,449
University North Carolina

84
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:39,389
did a joint collection and they

85
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:42,300
collected 111 accessions including some

86
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:45,060
large fruity types that we had never had

87
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,788
before and some self compatible types

88
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:55,470
that could be inbred which is unusual

89
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:57,628
for tomatillo in 2013 dr. song who is

90
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,960
also the research leader at PG are you

91
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:02,669
and dr. Robertson made a trip to the

92
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,128
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences

93
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:07,620
in Beijing and they did some germplasm

94
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:10,169
exchange and I was telling done I was

95
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,379
supposed to fly to China tomorrow for a

96
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:17,579
similar opportunity but because Trump is

97
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:19,680
in China this week I can't go hopefully

98
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:23,129
it will happen at the end of the month

99
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:27,090
next month so for a regeneration is

100
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:29,459
quite a big project we do a couple

101
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:32,668
hundred plots usually on average 150 to

102
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:36,180
200 plots per year so each plot is a

103
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:38,279
population or accession and we cover

104
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,439
them with these nylon mesh cages when

105
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,629
they're ready to flower and then

106
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:46,649
honeybees are introduced we rent the

107
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:48,750
honeybees hives and we usually do about

108
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:51,810
eight different species or texta per

109
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,968
year including biennials and annuals and

110
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,490
we have different size cages depending

111
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:58,439
on the crops the winter squash go into

112
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:03,658
the largest cages they take up a lot of

113
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:07,259
space so this is just a some pictures of

114
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:11,129
the cages they have to be isolated from

115
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:13,229
each other so we use a plow to put soil

116
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:15,750
over the edges and then they have

117
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:21,959
zippers where you can go in and out of

118
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:24,329
the cage and we use black plastic to

119
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,978
grow everything except for the tomato

120
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:30,448
and then there's drip tape underneath

121
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:32,519
the plastic for the biennials they have

122
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:35,968
to be overwintered so for example other

123
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,379
cabbage or dug out of the fields they're

124
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:39,418
ready to do that now but it rains so

125
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:43,139
much we're not sure when we're gonna be

126
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:47,729
able to dig them but they go into these

127
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:50,139
wooden crates with sawdust and then

128
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,670
when they're planted you can see they're

129
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:55,930
just stubs in the field they take off

130
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:58,810
all the heads and they got that that

131
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,120
meristem the growing tissue tip there

132
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,730
and then those those are going to start

133
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,889
and then here you can see when they're

134
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,780
in the flowering stage there's a cage

135
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,969
around most people don't see cabbage

136
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:13,779
flowers because you eat the head and

137
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:18,220
that's a second year what happens and

138
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:19,959
those some things they might not flower

139
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,090
they might not have enough time so we

140
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:25,120
dig them up like these collards the

141
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:28,060
picture of the collards they were

142
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,189
brought in fertilized for like six or

143
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,399
eight weeks in a cold chamber in

144
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:34,990
December and then in January they flower

145
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,719
in the greenhouse and those are hand

146
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:41,740
pollinated so to pee on the crop we have

147
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,920
to sir custom regenerate it and then we

148
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:48,310
have we dry the material in mesh bags

149
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,350
that are hanging out at the barn and

150
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,920
then we have different types of machines

151
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:58,870
to Thresh the seed depending on the crop

152
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:00,850
and then for the seed storage um this

153
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,120
thing will come in from the barn and it

154
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:06,939
will go into this thing called the ante

155
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,579
room so the pre ante room is where we do

156
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:12,399
like seed orders it's controlled

157
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:14,409
humidity and temperature

158
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,149
you know we weigh the seed in there then

159
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:20,860
the ante room it's more like a

160
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:23,409
refrigerator and let me see

161
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:28,810
there's my pointer that's the ante room

162
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:31,660
here so we dry down the seed in that

163
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,659
room to six percent relative humidity

164
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:37,840
and that is stored long-term and then

165
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:44,919
this is the long-term storage facility

166
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:47,350
here so it's basically a freezer we do

167
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:49,629
characterize the time to characterize

168
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,720
for us is when we're regenerating so we

169
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:54,610
can only do highly heritable traits we

170
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,730
do collaborations with breeders and

171
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,800
other scientists if we get some grant

172
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,610
funding we could do more trace other

173
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,078
than just highly

174
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,079
haribol trace we can do things in

175
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:08,349
replicant for example in 2015 we did a

176
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:09,429
field trial of Brett of our Brassica

177
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,610
Rapa accessions

178
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:17,949
in collaboration with Michael Gore and

179
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:21,039
Chris Pearce um this year we start a new

180
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,850
way to collect data we bought this small

181
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:28,328
Android tablet it's very lightweight

182
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:30,459
easy and this field look freeware and

183
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:32,949
it's spreadsheet compatible so we can

184
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:35,169
collect data in a way that we can easily

185
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:39,310
upload it into the green global database

186
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:41,379
and I've been talking with Steph Taylor

187
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:44,768
at the Long Island regional sea

188
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:46,389
consortium about they are developing a

189
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:49,750
smartphone app that they'll share with

190
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:51,490
us so maybe hopefully I'll make it

191
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,639
easier for people that receive our

192
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:57,240
material to collect data for us that's

193
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,129
what they're aiming for and we did

194
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,399
collect data on six different crops this

195
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:06,189
summer and this is just a screenshot of

196
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:10,448
the field book giving the list of traits

197
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:13,089
um so the person who put this in she's

198
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:15,219
she put al best the crop so she put that

199
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:16,959
as a prefix to every trait so they was

200
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,509
all the traits would sort together by

201
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,759
crop because they're alphabetical so al

202
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:25,539
in this case is a liam and the BB is

203
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:28,419
biennial recipe and here's another

204
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:31,299
screenshot so it's a very nice interface

205
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:34,179
it's a very big interface so this is

206
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:37,629
plot for 10 like it was like a purse

207
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:40,328
economist tomato the tray is leaf type

208
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:43,720
and then you can see the definitions are

209
00:10:40,328 --> 00:10:46,778
right there dwarf potato leaves etc so

210
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,028
she can just type in and number three

211
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:53,528
and then hit this one and it will scroll

212
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:56,320
to the next plot and then you can also

213
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:58,000
use photo as a tray it will collect the

214
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:03,430
photo and it will label the photo for

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,339
you with your plant ID which is nice so

216
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:09,429
we get images of plots of plants of hand

217
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:13,750
shapes as our traits and those go into

218
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:18,309
the green global database we do

219
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:21,220
um also scanning of fruits and this year

220
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:23,979
we tried to scan radish but it didn't

221
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,410
skin very well because it's so dark so

222
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,149
she ended up using a camera and they

223
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:29,350
don't look that nice I mean you have to

224
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:31,029
remember they were growing four seed

225
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,750
they weren't really grown for the radish

226
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:37,269
the edible portion but we've to give

227
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,519
people pictures is better than to not

228
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:41,319
give them pictures so we think it's

229
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,509
valuable to do these images and you can

230
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,540
see there's a lot of diversity in our

231
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:48,909
collection so I'm going to talk a little

232
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:52,179
bit about green global like I said I do

233
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:56,169
get quite a few questions about that and

234
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:59,500
it did change recently so this is if you

235
00:11:56,169 --> 00:12:03,729
just googled green glow ball and PGS you

236
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:06,340
would get this is the starting page that

237
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,590
you would search from so if I suggest

238
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,870
that if you just like you're pretty sure

239
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:13,149
you're gonna order something the first

240
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,560
thing to do or maybe the second thing

241
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,449
after you found what you want but you

242
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,759
want to register with an account and

243
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:24,220
then read the Help section it's really

244
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:26,860
well written it's a good resource so you

245
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,440
can search for things like a descriptor

246
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,139
so in this case the descriptors are all

247
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,339
crop specific so I don't know how easy

248
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:35,949
it is for you to read this thing but

249
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:39,490
this is when you go to the descriptors

250
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:41,800
link you get the list of crops I picked

251
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,409
maize and then you get the traits for

252
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:47,079
maize coming up so I picked kernel color

253
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:54,370
you put a check mark and then you could

254
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:57,370
say equal to then I said red and then

255
00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:00,070
you do the search and you ind Doug to

256
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,419
maize accessions with kernel color red

257
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,339
and then you would go through and check

258
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:05,949
the boxes of the ones that you want to

259
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:09,220
order and if you click on the name of it

260
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,720
you'll get a more detailed page and I'll

261
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,430
show you that in a minute there's

262
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,649
another way to order if you had a list

263
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:18,789
of accessions like pea I numbers usually

264
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:22,958
from a paper or something the search box

265
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:24,759
expands if you say using a list of

266
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,449
accessions and then you can just copy it

267
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:30,409
from a spreadsheet and paste it

268
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:32,030
here and get the search that way okay

269
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,639
this is what an accession page looks

270
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:37,970
like if you click on the accession this

271
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,059
is one P I of tomatillo you see the

272
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,680
image and there's also if it has it it

273
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:45,619
will have map data in there

274
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:48,079
it also has information here about its

275
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,620
source and things like that so if you

276
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:55,160
click on that map for this one the green

277
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:59,629
dot is that one accession and then these

278
00:13:55,159 --> 00:14:01,879
other gods or other accessions and the

279
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:04,730
it's colored by a number of accession so

280
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,870
yellow is one accession and work session

281
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,080
so if you were trying to do a

282
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:13,090
geographical survey or study this would

283
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:16,250
help you to pick your material possibly

284
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:19,840
you can also use multiple criteria you

285
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:22,039
do advanced search and then in this case

286
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,870
you know there's a drop-down list of

287
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:26,599
things you can pick I pick two your

288
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:29,810
country of origin Brazil the state of

289
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,550
Rio de Janeiro and then for example you

290
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:34,339
could say improvement level is breeding

291
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:39,529
material and you can go on and on and

292
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:41,600
add multiple criteria one thing I really

293
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:43,879
like is the green taxonomy that's a

294
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,779
really good resource for anybody working

295
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:50,330
with plants um it gives the common names

296
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:51,980
it gives conspecific taxa and it gives

297
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:56,030
synonyms so if you're reading an old

298
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,889
paper and it's a genus and species and

299
00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:00,819
you want to see what the current name is

300
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:03,769
it's a really good way to do that or

301
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,940
common names you know and you try to

302
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:10,909
look at the common name it's a very

303
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:15,170
scholarly set of information and it's

304
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:20,079
very well curated so there's a taxonomy

305
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:22,429
link there okay so now I'm gonna switch

306
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,950
to talk a little bit about some of the

307
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:30,949
genetic research that's going on in my

308
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:33,770
lab we've done quite a bit of genotyping

309
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:36,710
of collections and the method that we've

310
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:38,779
been using is genotyping by sequencing

311
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,160
and you've probably familiar with it

312
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:44,318
because a lot of the

313
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:49,189
was developed here at Cornell um it's

314
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:53,809
fairly inexpensive $20 per DNA sample

315
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:58,000
and if you do 96-well format on set of

316
00:15:53,809 --> 00:16:03,049
samples and because you're finding your

317
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,389
mutations your markers your snips at the

318
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:06,889
same time that your genotyping them you

319
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:09,169
don't get the bias whereas if you just

320
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:13,759
had a set of markers and you use that

321
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:15,469
set to genotype your material you

322
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,089
wouldn't find the additional markers and

323
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,189
it doesn't require a reference genome

324
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:23,120
and that's really important for us

325
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:27,649
because with the exception of you know

326
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,000
tomato and the Brassica Rapa had a good

327
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:34,909
reference genome but some of the other

328
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,458
crops don't have any reference genome so

329
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:39,980
this is that same slide I showed you

330
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:42,258
earlier our major collections and what I

331
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,889
did was I just put an asterisk next to

332
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:48,500
the ones that we've done some GBS so

333
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:50,688
we've done most of the major collections

334
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,539
and I can't say we've done all the

335
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:55,610
accessions but we've done sampled

336
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:58,129
accessions and we pick the samples based

337
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:02,990
on certain criteria such as geography or

338
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:06,109
morphology so I'm going to go through

339
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:09,769
these just briefly to tell you the

340
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:11,658
highlights of these different studies so

341
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:14,750
the first one I'm talk about is I in

342
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:17,720
Allium CEPA it's highly consumed in the

343
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,730
United States its economic value its

344
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,548
ranks third amongst the vegetables

345
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:25,250
it's an ancient globally widespread crop

346
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:28,400
and there's thousands of onion cultivars

347
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,109
that have been developed to fit very

348
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,370
diverse environments and dietary

349
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:36,859
preferences it is a costly crop to breed

350
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:39,229
and conserve because it is biennial it

351
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:41,689
requires cross-pollination it's a very

352
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:45,950
daylight sensitive as far as whether or

353
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:50,600
not it will flower um also it has a very

354
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:52,970
large genome and so it's very hard to

355
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:54,548
develop molecular genetic markers that

356
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:58,759
breeders could you

357
00:17:54,548 --> 00:18:02,179
when we did GBS we found 70,000 markers

358
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:04,940
single nucleotide polymorphism morphism

359
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:07,780
snip markers and we use doubled haploid

360
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:11,960
lines as controls those double tap legs

361
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:14,629
should be homozygous so whenever a

362
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,840
marker was not homozygous in one of

363
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:20,360
those th lines we threw it out and we

364
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:23,599
also had a mapping population f2 mapping

365
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:26,779
population that our collaborator my kV

366
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:29,629
had developed so we also use the

367
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:32,710
expected segregation ratios in that

368
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:38,179
population to decide whether markers

369
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:38,600
were high quality markers so you doing

370
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:40,970
this

371
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:44,689
we started with 70,000 we ended up with

372
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:48,429
900 markers um but those 900 markers

373
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:51,919
should be good high quality markers so

374
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:54,259
we concluded and we're going to write up

375
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,600
a paper what I have at the bottom here

376
00:18:54,259 --> 00:19:02,419
is just a poster that gb/s is promising

377
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:07,428
I still have to analyze the data we have

378
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:10,490
95 of our accessions also genotyped but

379
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:12,590
I'll say it is promising but we had to

380
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:16,160
Jeff Club its who works here at Cornell

381
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:17,779
had to make custom scripts to analyze

382
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,620
the data because it was so challenging

383
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:25,279
with this large genome and I tried to

384
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:27,798
utilize it multiple times and I I just

385
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:32,269
didn't get very good results so with his

386
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:36,289
custom work and expertise we were able

387
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:39,889
to do it the next one I'll talk about is

388
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:43,099
Brassica Rapa it's different types of

389
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:45,679
Asian greens it's can be consumed raw or

390
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:49,490
cooked it's you might know it as mizuna

391
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:53,120
chinese cabbage bok choy a spice sarsen

392
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:58,039
it's also root vegetable turnip which is

393
00:19:53,119 --> 00:20:02,058
also used as animal fodder and it's also

394
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:03,500
used as a cooking oil so these are all

395
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:05,569
different more four types that have been

396
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,859
developed you know across the globe but

397
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:10,889
the genetic relationship

398
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:12,839
haven't been well understood and if we

399
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,750
knew more about how they were related to

400
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:19,829
each other that would help breeders and

401
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:23,369
also conservation so we're able to

402
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:27,539
sample braska rep from our G Bank and

403
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:29,489
also from the gene bacon Ames Iowa and

404
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,980
we genotyped

405
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,500
ten different more four types and we

406
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:39,058
ended up with 333 accessions by over

407
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:41,548
18,000 snips and this was published this

408
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:47,009
year earlier Kevin BER was a student in

409
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:49,558
Chris Pierce lab and he took the lead on

410
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:53,759
this and published it and what he found

411
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:57,168
was that there was a genetic distinction

412
00:20:53,759 --> 00:21:00,150
and among the more four types but also

413
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:01,770
the same more four type might be

414
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,890
genetically different if it had a

415
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:07,710
different geographic origin and so that

416
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:14,370
was the largest data set of this kind to

417
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:16,650
date the next one is tomatillo it

418
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:19,889
originated in central Mexico it's widely

419
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:22,350
cultivated in Guatemala and Mexico is

420
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:25,549
primarily concerned as relishes or

421
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:28,048
sauces such as green salsa and it's

422
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:31,619
becoming increasingly increasingly

423
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:35,579
important in the USA and then as a niche

424
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:40,259
crop it is considered underutilized

425
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:42,149
species by the FAO and breeders might be

426
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:45,390
interested in size disease resistance

427
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:47,610
and mechanical harvest previous studies

428
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,620
of populations showed them to be closely

429
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:52,469
related to each other that was worked by

430
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:55,798
todd vision who also went on that

431
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:59,730
collection trip with Larry um so we GBS

432
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:02,879
genotyped 125 accessions and we got a

433
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:07,610
pretty large data set um and basically

434
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,780
to summarize we did find a lack of

435
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:12,899
relationship based on geographical

436
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:15,200
origins similar to other researchers

437
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,490
have found but we did identify

438
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,299
eighty-six pairs of accessions that were

439
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,839
qualitatively different from each other

440
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:24,990
and we were able

441
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:28,589
to graphically represent qualitative

442
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:30,659
divergence among the 125 accessions and

443
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:32,759
we also confirm the homozygosity of the

444
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:36,150
have some new inbred lines that Larry

445
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:40,169
developed the next one we'll talk about

446
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:42,330
is wild tomato so this one a very

447
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:45,000
diverse wild tomato that's used a lot in

448
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:47,879
breeding solanum proved Yanam it was

449
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,119
recently reclassifying to four distinct

450
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,630
species but there is gene flow among the

451
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:57,898
species so we genotyped

452
00:22:54,630 --> 00:23:01,830
forty six plants representing different

453
00:22:57,898 --> 00:23:04,619
species about twelve perceives and found

454
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:10,288
and we used fourteen thousand of the

455
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:12,778
markers and we did find that based on

456
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:15,298
geography isolation by distance is the

457
00:23:12,778 --> 00:23:18,000
geographical distance so that means they

458
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:19,889
we found support for isolation by

459
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,419
distances which means that things that

460
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:26,788
were sampled and more remote distances

461
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,799
from each other were more genetically

462
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:32,099
different from each other and especially

463
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,839
this pattern was observed if it was

464
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:36,839
between the pairs of species so that

465
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:39,178
supported some idea that there is

466
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:42,509
reproductive isolation between the

467
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:45,059
species and we found two of these new

468
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:48,119
taxa weren't significantly different

469
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:50,398
from each other genetically but we did

470
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:55,500
find a lot of markers that we could

471
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:59,398
possibly use as diagnostic markers to

472
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:03,538
identify the species and this is just a

473
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:05,308
graph of what I just mentioned that the

474
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:07,859
genetic distance is here and then the

475
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:11,668
log of the distances kilometers is here

476
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:14,219
and within a species the points are red

477
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:16,080
and between species the points are blue

478
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,528
so you can see there's a higher slope in

479
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:23,278
the blue one it was significant

480
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:25,710
so that's supporting that there is more

481
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,659
reproductive isolation isolation by

482
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,980
distance between species and within

483
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:33,380
species then I

484
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:37,640
I'll talk about quickly is a winter

485
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:40,130
squash it's been valued for its good

486
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,470
storage properties it has a thick hard

487
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:46,700
skin and it provides a wide range of

488
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:50,240
nutrients consumer demand has been

489
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,779
increasing very recent decades and it

490
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,940
has some naturally occurring compounds

491
00:24:52,779 --> 00:25:00,428
that have been shown to have health

492
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:03,650
benefits and also use in pest control

493
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:06,290
improvement breeding is focused on fruit

494
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:09,860
size and shape non bitterness deep

495
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:12,558
orange fruit color earliness Bush habit

496
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:14,629
insect and disease resistance and what

497
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,259
we have are what we call course that's

498
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:19,250
based on morphological diversity

499
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:22,129
ninety-five of our accessions and

500
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:24,319
geographical diversity another 95

501
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:27,200
accessions from 38 countries but these

502
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:30,649
two sets overlap so there's a total of

503
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,100
165 accessions and we sampled plants

504
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:36,830
multiple plants per accession

505
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:39,139
right now we have the data collected and

506
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:42,909
I'm collaborating with people from cute

507
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:46,490
kept including some people from Cornell

508
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,570
and hopefully they have some data too so

509
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,019
we're going to put all of our data

510
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:55,599
together radishes the next one we'll

511
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:57,769
talk about it might not be that

512
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,889
important in the US but across the globe

513
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:04,129
it's pretty important it's 2% of all

514
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:06,530
global vegetable production it's

515
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:09,620
consumed as a root as a leafy vegetable

516
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:12,079
in some places as sprouts seeds or seed

517
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:14,779
pods and it's also used as a cover crop

518
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,869
or a forage crop Ouisa as a cover crop

519
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:22,039
it's nice it breaks up the soil and then

520
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:24,349
it provides organic material you know

521
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:27,289
for the soil to improve the soil it is

522
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:30,039
an ancient crop native to eastern

523
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:32,569
Mediterranean in eastern Asia and

524
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:34,548
there's some debate whether it's had

525
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:38,000
water and multiple domestication events

526
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:41,658
and there's a lot of morphological

527
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,660
diversity depending on where in the

528
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:47,600
globe it's utilized

529
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:52,820
there also adapts to local conditions

530
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:57,679
it's a rich source of nutrients so we

531
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:59,269
have of course that based on G a way to

532
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:04,100
geographical sampling that means we

533
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:06,829
sample more accessions if we had more

534
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:09,109
representation from that country so we

535
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:12,289
ended up with 35 countries 152

536
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:17,569
accessions and 5 plants per accession

537
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:21,980
and that data I haven't analyzed that's

538
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:24,919
one of the overlap interests with people

539
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:27,950
in China they're very interested they

540
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,769
study radish so hopefully our relations

541
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:35,000
and collaborations with them will move

542
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:36,710
this project forward um next one is

543
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,130
cultivate tomato like I said it's our

544
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:42,430
most important crop it's highly it's our

545
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,260
most important crop that we can serve

546
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:47,450
because we have the most successions and

547
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:49,609
we get the most requests for it it's

548
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,069
highly consumed in fresh and processed

549
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:53,949
forms it's considered a high value but

550
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:56,629
high risk crop because it is very

551
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,980
vulnerable to diseases mostly you

552
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:02,480
probably know that because you've tried

553
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:04,519
to grow some mostly well relatives are

554
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,819
used as breeding because it has a narrow

555
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:12,160
genetic base and it's like I said it's

556
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:14,960
very susceptible to pests and stresses

557
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,670
consumers in the US want more flavor

558
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,980
color they like the heirloom types but

559
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:25,880
those required still the resistances a

560
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:29,120
shelf-life and the durability so what we

561
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,190
have is 185 accession corset based on

562
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,239
geographical origin centers by diversity

563
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:34,340
fruit shape

564
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,259
heirlooms commercially important

565
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:45,129
varieties and we a say two sets of

566
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:50,930
96-well plates and when I analyze this

567
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:54,920
we ended up with around 3700 high

568
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:57,170
quality markers in 190 plants there's a

569
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,160
software you used to analyze what you

570
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:03,470
call the population

571
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:05,750
structure so we had Pimpernel Fillion is

572
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,089
a wild tomato' we have one sample of

573
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:12,200
that and what this is showing there's

574
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:14,659
like three virtual groups populations

575
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:18,470
the yellow the blue and the orange and

576
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:22,250
so what these numbers are across this

577
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:25,509
axis are the hundred ninety plants so

578
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:28,220
each of these little lines is that

579
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:31,220
genotype of that one plant so pimpernel

580
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,460
folium had the most yellow genome you

581
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,470
would call it virtual genome and then

582
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:39,789
also some of the blue but it didn't have

583
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:41,870
any of the orange so at this far end

584
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:45,859
genetically we had Pippen else William

585
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:49,569
at this far end way up here this sample

586
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:52,789
here was a pair type ellipsoid type

587
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:55,179
tomato from Italy it had a lot of the

588
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:58,940
orange a little blue and a little yellow

589
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:01,029
so what you're looking for is when I

590
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,509
point out here there's some kind of

591
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:07,160
genotypes that kind of stick out and

592
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:09,589
this is another way to look at it it's

593
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,420
called a neighbor joining tree is the

594
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:13,009
same data says the same data it's just

595
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,009
looking at in a different way it's more

596
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:17,629
like a tree so Pippen L folium is out

597
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:19,519
here you would expect so this is the

598
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:22,400
most distantly related to all these

599
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,889
other genotypes the branches length of

600
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,680
the tree is the genetic distance and

601
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:30,500
then what you're seeing are a lot of

602
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:33,769
things that kind of just are closely

603
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:36,309
related but then you see these outliers

604
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:39,170
so these Italian types look diverged

605
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:41,599
there's this cherry tomato type here

606
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:46,220
this divergent and then you get these

607
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:48,709
other accessions that are also divergent

608
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:53,180
and they're kind of falling more towards

609
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:55,970
Pimpernel folium so what those are are

610
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:58,370
probably land races that might have

611
00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:02,569
crossed with Pimpernel folium in their

612
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:05,179
history so what we have here this is a

613
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:07,819
land race accession this closely related

614
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:11,778
to well tomato yet it has this big large

615
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:13,689
red fruit so I guess

616
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:16,878
we found is there could be some

617
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:21,019
exceptions in our collection that could

618
00:31:16,878 --> 00:31:22,908
have diverse genes but they still have

619
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:26,028
the large red round fruit which pimping

620
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:28,899
Ella phillium has a small small fruit

621
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:33,409
that tastes terrible

622
00:31:28,898 --> 00:31:36,378
so if a breeder wanted to try to get

623
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:38,419
something that was divergent but not go

624
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:42,009
for that little tiny terrible fruit they

625
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:42,009
might try to use something like this

626
00:31:43,848 --> 00:31:48,888
yeah so we're winding down here so the

627
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:51,009
other thing I just want to mention it

628
00:31:48,888 --> 00:31:54,678
was some of our outreach in education

629
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:57,798
activities we rarely ever say no if

630
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:59,570
somebody asks us to do outreach we try

631
00:31:57,798 --> 00:32:02,569
to accommodate them and one of our most

632
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:05,118
popular things that we get invited for

633
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:08,148
is to extract DNA from a banana using

634
00:32:05,118 --> 00:32:12,079
common household chemicals and I show

635
00:32:08,148 --> 00:32:14,118
over here what we use and this is um an

636
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,460
elementary school in Geneva it's called

637
00:32:14,118 --> 00:32:19,308
science night and you can see the kids

638
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,528
come and they get to do it hands-on and

639
00:32:19,308 --> 00:32:23,658
then they get to see the DNA we use a

640
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:26,628
toothpick and they can pull the DNA out

641
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:31,039
of the solution they take the DNA home

642
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:32,658
if they want to allow them do and they

643
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,098
really love it and they and we give them

644
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,659
the protocol so they can take it home

645
00:32:34,098 --> 00:32:38,509
and teach other people how to do it so

646
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:43,219
let's just try to educate you know the

647
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:45,139
public about what DNA is another thing

648
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:47,179
that I'm pretty heavily involved in is

649
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:50,709
called the northern organic vegetable

650
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:53,690
improvement collaborative know that and

651
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:56,808
people Cornell are also involved in this

652
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,278
like Michael Missouri right now but

653
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,408
Molly John was the one that kind of

654
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:02,479
started it many years ago it wasn't

655
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:05,509
under the same name but it's the same

656
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:09,348
project that's evolved over time the

657
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:12,759
idea is to breed new varieties for

658
00:33:09,348 --> 00:33:16,598
organic condition that do well in

659
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:19,460
northern climates so they try to

660
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:23,798
identify the best varieties for organic

661
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:25,650
firms they work directly with farmers

662
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:28,079
educate others

663
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:30,990
and exceeds variety trials and I'm fart

664
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:34,859
breeding and what we do mostly because

665
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:39,299
we're so good at sue cleaning we teach

666
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:42,659
people about saving seed and how to

667
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:44,940
process see how to grow things to save

668
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:48,180
the seed so this is these are pictures

669
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,650
from a fair that we do in Maine every

670
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,710
year where we actually bring up a

671
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:55,500
trailer full of heart-like threshers and

672
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:57,600
the wetsy processor for the tomato and

673
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,460
we get a lot of people coming to try

674
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,859
learn how to do these things and we hand

675
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:06,090
out a lot of information and we hand out

676
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:08,759
seeds also that brings people so I'm

677
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:11,960
gonna wrap it up now I just thank you

678
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:16,620
all for your patience and for being here

679
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:18,539
we have a big staff that work I work

680
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:22,139
with every day and they make all this

681
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:25,918
possible it ranges from greenhouse to

682
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:29,250
farm to the seed storage the database

683
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,769
person and then Susan does research

684
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,780
support like the field characterization

685
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:36,480
and a lab characterization and we have a

686
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,330
lot of technical assistance on these

687
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,019
three individuals just graduated from

688
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:44,880
Hobart away Smith Colleges last spring

689
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:46,679
and then they came out to work with us

690
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,440
temporarily and learn a lot about

691
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,659
agriculture and that's a picture of me

692
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:56,429
and Larry Robertson our farmer curator

693
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:58,440
I'm AG McGrath's in Long Island tomato

694
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:00,030
trials a few years ago they have such

695
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,970
sandy soil down there we could use a

696
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:05,280
golf cart and that was really great we

697
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:17,659
really enjoyed that so I'll be happy to

698
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:23,790
take any questions and thank you yeah

699
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:26,239
Geneva are you there do you have any

700
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,239
questions

701
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:32,068
that was a Louisville talk thank you so

702
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:34,768
much

703
00:35:32,068 --> 00:35:37,018
I was curious with your Allium diversity

704
00:35:34,768 --> 00:35:41,548
study it looked like you really had to

705
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:43,108
libel down the good snips to what seven

706
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:46,798
or nine hundred forget the exact number

707
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:49,230
yeah yeah that's true yep you're really

708
00:35:46,798 --> 00:35:56,788
wacky segregation distortion that he saw

709
00:35:49,230 --> 00:36:00,630
in that population and I know it's a lot

710
00:35:56,789 --> 00:36:05,519
of it has to do with probably tandem

711
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:08,278
duplications yeah so like I said I

712
00:36:05,518 --> 00:36:11,969
wasn't able to analyze it every when I

713
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:14,759
did get a set of snips and then I would

714
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:16,108
give them to our collaborator my kV to

715
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:19,769
map them he found that they were

716
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:22,858
clustering together they weren't really

717
00:36:19,768 --> 00:36:28,768
well distributed either so like I said

718
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:34,199
Jeff had to really do a lot of extra

719
00:36:28,768 --> 00:36:40,068
custom scripts to analyze the data to

720
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:55,338
get down to those 900 thank you so much

721
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:55,338
yep thanks sequencing information

722
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:02,548
collection that breeders might use I'm

723
00:37:01,108 --> 00:37:06,498
curious like what you think from a

724
00:37:02,548 --> 00:37:06,498
conservation standpoint the implication

725
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:14,518
yeah um I know there's different ideas

726
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:16,618
about that um kind of we don't want to

727
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:18,649
get rid of things and say we have this

728
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:21,380
course that represents all the diversity

729
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:24,720
we don't need the rest of the collection

730
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,838
that's not something that I I would be

731
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:30,509
in favor or mpg-us doesn't have that

732
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:32,460
philosophy it's nice to have what you

733
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:33,960
call a course at a lot of times I don't

734
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,690
even like to call the course that I'd

735
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,059
like to call a diversity panel based on

736
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:41,369
whatever it was

737
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:45,659
developed you know geography or

738
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:47,549
morphology but I imagine there is a lot

739
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:49,369
of redundancy you know we know there's

740
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:52,110
probably a lot of redundancy we can't

741
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:55,339
conserve all of it it would just cost

742
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:58,769
too much but for something like tomato

743
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:01,140
the life of those seeds is fifty or a

744
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:04,139
hundred years the way we store them so

745
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:06,029
we can't afford to keep them until

746
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:07,639
somebody can sequence the whole genome I

747
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:12,210
don't think it'll be that long before

748
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:14,879
it'll be we're affordable to sequence

749
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:24,420
the whole genome a multiple plans for

750
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:31,769
accession you know what what makes a

751
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:33,809
high quality yeah yeah that's a good

752
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:37,769
question it goes through a analysis

753
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:40,980
pipeline so things that you look at how

754
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:46,679
many times is it observed you know you

755
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:48,510
have millions of sequences so you know

756
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:50,669
how many times is observed and there's

757
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:52,260
gonna be a threshold you set you set

758
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:56,389
these parameters depending on your

759
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:59,340
sample size in the biology for example

760
00:38:56,389 --> 00:39:02,400
for the mapping population they need to

761
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:04,079
be in the parents right we don't want

762
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,660
anything that wasn't in the parents and

763
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,119
that mapping population and they had to

764
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:13,139
segregate the way they were expected and

765
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,639
they had to be homozygous so those are

766
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:18,480
the male's the other thing is you only

767
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:21,420
want we don't want more than two alleles

768
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:25,349
at a locus these are mutations in the

769
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:27,210
DNA so you're not likely going to get

770
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:29,309
three mutations it's going to be an

771
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,500
alignment problem with the sequence that

772
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:34,679
gave you that third or fourth mutation

773
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,150
you know if you have GATC you just want

774
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:37,259
two of those you do want three or four

775
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,110
of those because that's probably

776
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:43,020
alignment misalignment maybe there was

777
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:45,870
an insertion or deletion nearby that

778
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:48,090
caused it to look like a mutation so

779
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:51,420
those are the those are some of the

780
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:52,720
things that you you set the parameters

781
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:57,460
in

782
00:39:52,719 --> 00:40:03,699
pipeline filter we call it filtering

783
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:06,639
them down so Joanne spoke about putting

784
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:11,259
seeds into the deep freeze for long-term

785
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:14,500
storage do you periodically retest the

786
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:17,320
viability of that see yes so they're

787
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,239
tested before they go into storage

788
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,880
they're tested so the things that just

789
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:25,799
came out of the field in 2017 after

790
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:29,050
they're given a few weeks to dry down

791
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,550
then they'll be viability tested if they

792
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:33,340
don't have good viability we won't

793
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:35,980
probably keep them unless it's the only

794
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,559
thing we have then we would keep it but

795
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:42,250
yeah they should undergo if depending on

796
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:44,139
the crop every 5 or 10 years and that's

797
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:46,230
the kind of thing if we could get more

798
00:40:44,139 --> 00:40:49,269
feedback from people that we send it to

799
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:51,699
we wouldn't necessarily have to do that

800
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:55,358
germ cast ourselves we could use their

801
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:56,679
data like if we send somebody 50 seeds

802
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,440
and they say oh they're great

803
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:04,838
we got 100 percent sure we would use

804
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:07,599
that you know observation so yeah we do

805
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:24,759
some of our own germ testing and we're

806
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:28,150
also outsource some of it self

807
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:32,050
incompatible yeah that's why we use the

808
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:35,019
honey bees in the cages or we do it by

809
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:40,630
hand so the accession is a diverse

810
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:43,838
population so you don't have within that

811
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:49,230
accession it's not incompatible with

812
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:49,230
itself but yeah

813
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,240
do out cross them if we if if we have to

814
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:58,670
do it by hand with a paintbrush we do it

815
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,529
by hand but then they're gonna cross to

816
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:09,260
other plants in the same accession like

817
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:11,060
radish for example did that answer yeah

818
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,590
we don't have like breeding what we

819
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:16,579
