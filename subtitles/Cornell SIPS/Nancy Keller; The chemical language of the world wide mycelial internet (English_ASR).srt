1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,919
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:05,918
university

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,879
so thank you today i'm going to be

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,000
talking about

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
the chemical language of fungi so indeed

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,559
as

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,679
gary was basically telling you we spent

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,278
a lot of time

9
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:23,679
my whole life honestly that is my career

10
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:26,000
i'm looking working with fungi and

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,160
specializing actually quite a bit on the

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,559
signals that fungi make

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,439
a lot of them being what are known as

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,920
secondary metabolites

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,519
these are compounds that most people

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,440
actually know about even though they

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,760
don't know they know about it

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,519
many of the pigments that fungi make and

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,280
you can see in the spores in this

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,719
particular

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,280
slide here are melanins that often

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,679
are natural products of a certain

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,439
chemical class

24
00:00:53,679 --> 00:01:00,479
oh i see if you go over to this slide

25
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,718
so when we think about communication and

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,478
really this entire lecture is now

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,879
about communication um fungal chemicals

28
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,760
this is something we learn when we're i

29
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,199
don't know

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,478
in first grade or preschool we have eyes

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,600
ears nose

32
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:20,879
mouth and touch well what do fungi

33
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:24,559
have fungi

34
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:28,000
actually share a lot of

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,000
perception as us they don't have a nose

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,759
per se or a mouth per se

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,118
but they do perceive chemicals

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,159
much the same way that analogously

39
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,959
to let's say people with their smell and

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,960
taste

41
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,959
fungi do have vision as well and they do

42
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,599
have touch responses i'm not sure about

43
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,438
hearing

44
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,158
but today we're going to talk about

45
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,158
chemicals

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,680
so most of the chemicals that fungi

47
00:01:54,078 --> 00:02:00,000
make are known as natural products or

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,680
secondary metabolites

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,438
and these compounds are all derived from

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:11,039
primary metabolites for example

51
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,840
we can have acyl coas that all organisms

52
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,639
make they go

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
to make fatty acids for example or your

54
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,359
or membrane

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,480
steriles fungi and bacteria

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,599
and plants i could say as well can

57
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,598
take these natural on these acyl coas

58
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,280
they use them for primary metabolism but

59
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,959
they also incorporate them

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,199
into two big chemical classes called

61
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,080
polyketides

62
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,518
and through the valinate pathway into

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,519
terpenes

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
and then amino acids which of course

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,879
fungi are going to use just as we do for

66
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,679
our

67
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,518
canonical proteins they also will take

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,800
these amino acids

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,039
and they will make short peptides they

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,239
are known mostly as non-ribosomal

71
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,959
peptides also

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,719
in our lab um we found a in a

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,840
collaboration with frank schrader's lab

74
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,000
at cornell

75
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,039
we characterize a new chemical class and

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,479
fungi called us

77
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:09,439
cyanides now these are the

78
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,799
typical secondary metabolites people now

79
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,719
know pretty well

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,120
honestly this is pretty well known by

81
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,519
many people

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,719
there's big efforts for mining fungal

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,039
genomes

84
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,199
to get these for new drugs and in fact

85
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,199
we do quite a bit of that in our lab

86
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,839
as well though i won't touch on that

87
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,560
aspect of our research

88
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,598
all of these complex natural products

89
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,759
here are

90
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:34,878
almost invariably found in a

91
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,798
biosynthetic

92
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:41,000
gene cluster and this arrangement

93
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,040
has been very useful in the

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,680
bioinformatics study of

95
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,120
fungal natural products because

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,959
typically

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,360
in biosynthetic gene clusters you'll

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,840
have the synthase

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,000
that makes the particular chemical class

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,519
for example

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
polyketides are produced by polyketide

102
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,519
synthases

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,719
terpene cyclases or terpene synthetases

104
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,158
make these compounds and non-ribosomal

105
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,318
peptide synthases

106
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,840
are responsible for making these

107
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,039
metabolites

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,560
the amino acid sequence in these

109
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,358
synthases are

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,079
is pretty conserved so you can actually

111
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,079
find them

112
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,400
quite easily using various algorithms

113
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,959
now in a biosynthetic gene cluster

114
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:32,000
there's also typically

115
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,680
two to 15 tailoring enzymes

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,759
and these will be enzymes they're very

117
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,800
critical too because they'll take that

118
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,639
backbone that's derived from let's say

119
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,319
the polyketide synthase and be

120
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,079
responsible for

121
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:49,120
adding different moieties such as

122
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,359
let's say a methyl group or

123
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,360
um

124
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,960
we'll put in a

125
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,000
a pemerase and change the or

126
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,679
oxygen group so these are really

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,839
important um

128
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,199
and a biosynthetic gene cluster will

129
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,119
often but not always have a

130
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,439
transcription factor that's specific

131
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,959
to activate the expression of the other

132
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,319
genes in the cluster

133
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,120
there will often be a protective gene

134
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,519
because some of these compounds are

135
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,160
anti-fungal

136
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,079
a good example is gliotoxin made by

137
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,439
aspergillus fema goddess

138
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,439
it is an antifungal um so

139
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,360
the fungus itself has to find a way to

140
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,800
protect itself and it has an enzyme in

141
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,240
the pathway that actually will

142
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,038
cleave the gliotoxin to a more harmless

143
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,360
compound

144
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,159
and there will be hypothetical genes so

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,520
these are

146
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,720
canonical secondary metabolites that are

147
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:48,799
produced from biosynthetic gene clusters

148
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,960
but not all of our secondary metabolites

149
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,520
are coming from biosynthetic gene

150
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,638
clusters and today i'm going to present

151
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,560
two of our latest stories all involving

152
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,400
secondary metabolites

153
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,439
but one of them is more simple

154
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:09,279
our first story is a story

155
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:11,918
of self-communication

156
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,638
somewhat analogous to the paracrine or

157
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,240
autocrine

158
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,680
signaling that some of you might be

159
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,879
familiar with with

160
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,879
let's say in our

161
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:25,120
in immunology so

162
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,080
fungi have to know when to develop you

163
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,399
know you'll have a

164
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,478
an aspergillus species you have a small

165
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,599
resting spore it swells it has to

166
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,318
germinate

167
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,600
um the journaling then forms and it has

168
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,199
to branch and

169
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,759
you get heavy branching and then you'll

170
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,639
get development of the canadian four

171
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,879
so i'm going to be talking about a small

172
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,560
metabolite a secondary metabolite called

173
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:51,680
an oxylic bin

174
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,680
that actually is a signal for branching

175
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,478
the second story is going to turn to the

176
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,799
more canonical natural

177
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,478
products and not just fungal

178
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,439
biosynthetic gene clusters

179
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,439
oops let me sorry this is a very finicky

180
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,319
little mouse here

181
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,918
but also will involve some bacterial

182
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,039
natural products and the

183
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:16,240
crosstalk between fungi and bacteria

184
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:20,000
but let's start with this first story

185
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,120
on branching and fungi

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,360
this started long ago this uh

187
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
it has its roots in plant pathology as

188
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,560
do does

189
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,479
story two which i think is fitting for

190
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,680
the audience

191
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,560
many years ago i got really interested

192
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,360
in understanding how the seed pathogen

193
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,079
aspergillus flavus

194
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,560
invades seed aspergillus flavus produces

195
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,598
aflatoxin which is the most potent

196
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,759
carcinogen known to humankind and you

197
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,680
might think of all aspergilli as being

198
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,360
oh they're saprophytic they'll grow on

199
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,918
anything but actually that's not really

200
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,960
true

201
00:07:53,918 --> 00:08:00,159
so aspergillus are not too

202
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:03,680
they preferably like certain

203
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,560
i would say crops flavus grows on

204
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,240
seed and it prefers oil seed and i

205
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,720
became really interested in

206
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,560
trying to ask why is the oil seed the

207
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,199
preferable crop

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,759
at the time i was familiar with some

209
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,800
plant

210
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,520
studies where certain

211
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,759
fatty acids oxygenated fatty acids

212
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:27,918
called oxylipins were involved in

213
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:31,199
plant defense response to various

214
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,639
pathogens these oxylipins are considered

215
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,800
secondary metabolites

216
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,158
although they're simply made by

217
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,439
enzymatic action

218
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:41,120
on saturated i mean on unsaturated fatty

219
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,480
acids

220
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,799
well the time i started um this study

221
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,879
i became aware from another lab that

222
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,439
aspergillus species

223
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,720
make these oxylipins which are sort of

224
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,160
similar

225
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,440
somewhat in um structure to the plant

226
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,199
oxylipins

227
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,760
so one of the and they were already

228
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,240
named by um

229
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,240
another the the lab that found them as

230
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
psi factors

231
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,839
that name isn't really important they

232
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,720
use that name for because it was

233
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,240
precocious

234
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,000
sexual induction so it was known that

235
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,399
aspergilli made these and they were

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,120
involved in development of the fungus

237
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,240
i was interested in finding the enzymes

238
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,560
that made the psi

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,560
factors and

240
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,279
oh by the way let me ask can you see the

241
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,278
arrow when i move the arrow

242
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:42,239
anybody yes okay great so

243
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,399
i knew that the plant enzyme that made

244
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,680
these oxy lip bins for plants

245
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,480
were um lipoxygenases so

246
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,039
i found in the genome of the fungus

247
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,519
several

248
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,199
and my student actually demetrius

249
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,759
giannis is the one who really

250
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,160
was great in finding all these these

251
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,439
oxygenases

252
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:06,240
called ppos and they would make

253
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,920
and we found out that they made these uh

254
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,919
oxylipins and aspergillus

255
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,839
now i'm not going to go through all this

256
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,480
we had many many papers

257
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,360
um but the bottom line is this is that

258
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,920
we found that these

259
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,120
ppo enzymes that make the oxygenases if

260
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,439
you would delete them or

261
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,600
overexpress them you would actually

262
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,320
change the developmental program of the

263
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
fungus

264
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,440
here's a wild type aspergillus schnitzel

265
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,240
lens if you deleted ppoa you got

266
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,160
much more asexual growth and no sexual

267
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,320
whereas if you deleted ppoc

268
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,559
you would get the sexual development

269
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,000
this is a clay stathesium

270
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,119
the sexual fruiting body of aspergil

271
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,240
asparagines and less

272
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,278
asexual spores we also went on to find

273
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,120
that

274
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:57,679
when you added plant sec plant oxylipins

275
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,440
to fungal cultures it would change the

276
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,239
development of the fungus

277
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,000
and when we would take human um

278
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,240
oxylipins because humans make

279
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,600
prostaglandins and leukotrienes very

280
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,320
similar to

281
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,000
another type of oxylipin they would also

282
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,600
change the developmental plan

283
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,559
of the fungus so we ended up

284
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,519
hypothesizing and

285
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,799
putting forth several papers that we

286
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,078
felt that

287
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:27,519
oxylipins were signals cross-kingdom

288
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,278
signals that acted in a quorum sensing

289
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,039
manner with fungi

290
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,439
to change development now we could only

291
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,159
get

292
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
so far with all this research because

293
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,799
something that held us back

294
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,799
is that we were unable to procure enough

295
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,519
of the fungal oxylipins

296
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,240
no company sells them and it's very very

297
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,440
hard

298
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,799
to purify enough of them to do very good

299
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
work with fungi

300
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,278
however we there was a breakthrough that

301
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,200
occurred and now i'm going to take you

302
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:02,399
right into the depths of story

303
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,959
one but i'm starting with a

304
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,720
map of the world because story one has a

305
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,679
covet story that i thought concerning

306
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,879
the times you might be interested

307
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:15,278
this paper on where we actually have

308
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:18,480
found how one of the fungal oxylipins

309
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:22,240
actually promotes branching and fungi is

310
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,278
um a first author paper of my student

311
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,600
uh oh sorry i'm feeling

312
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,320
uh i'm thinking of coven and what she

313
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,278
went through

314
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,120
um mignow who graduated okay she has

315
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,278
graduated and she did great

316
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,639
what happened is she submitted her paper

317
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,360
to nature

318
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,039
um last christmas and of course we knew

319
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
it if it even went through we'd have to

320
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,719
do

321
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,879
gazillion uh morris studies uh

322
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,079
tests to actually get it published so

323
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,078
she asked if she could go

324
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,199
home to visit her parents for chinese

325
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,120
new year

326
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,120
i said sure you know why don't you do

327
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,320
that so she goes in january you know

328
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,720
what's happening here

329
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,600
and couldn't come back because the covid

330
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,600
um

331
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,040
situation in wuhan though she did not

332
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,360
live in wuhan

333
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,078
she went in january and she was only

334
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,360
able to get

335
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:11,759
back to wisconsin

336
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,278
to in july two weeks before her phd

337
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,399
defense

338
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:19,039
meanwhile we got the paper back um

339
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,000
nature said no we like it but why don't

340
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,759
you um it's

341
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
it's not quite nature we're going to

342
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,319
pass you on to nature communications

343
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,278
which we said okay that's a good one too

344
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,160
and of course

345
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,600
we had so much work that had to be done

346
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,879
in the laboratory

347
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:39,199
and there was mignow in china

348
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:42,559
so we actually uh

349
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,559
very proud of my lab

350
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,120
she communicated with everybody in the

351
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,319
lab

352
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,799
and as a community

353
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,440
they got this paper together and it's

354
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,799
been published in nature communication

355
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,519
anyways uh what a world we have

356
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,958
so the highlight is and let me show you

357
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,320
how we got to this

358
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,439
is that she found and the many people on

359
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,160
the paper

360
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,600
a specific oxylipin that aspergillus

361
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,559
makes and its specific

362
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,839
job is to induce branching so how did

363
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,198
she find this

364
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,560
one thing we did we're very particularly

365
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:24,399
interested in the ppo oxygenases because

366
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,159
when you delete ppoa you have a

367
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,720
phenotype with the fungus

368
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,000
so she grew up the fungus and she asked

369
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,040
what oxylipins do

370
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,600
we find so ppo a makes two oxylipins one

371
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,679
called

372
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,560
eight hoe this is derived from linoleic

373
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,479
acid and one is five eight dihold

374
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,559
and when she looked at fungal biomass

375
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,039
and the supernatant she could see that

376
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,239
5 8 was the most dominant and it was

377
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,639
also secreted

378
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,240
so we thought oh well let's see what 5 8

379
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,680
does

380
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,560
we are able to get migs of 5 8 because

381
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,278
another lab

382
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,559
had been able to purify it and express

383
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,838
an e coli

384
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,479
so we were ready to go and what does 5 8

385
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,959
do

386
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,639
you can see i have some nice movies but

387
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,039
they were so big i'm just going to show

388
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,240
you these um shots here

389
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,519
as you add more and more 5 8 into the

390
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,560
culture of the fungus and at

391
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,959
physiological

392
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,159
levels you can see there's an increase

393
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,958
in branching

394
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,958
and here we have the branches for for

395
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:28,638
100 microns of

396
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:31,359
length of hyphae we also

397
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,399
found that you could visualize this here

398
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,600
you see here

399
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,120
by staining with calciflora white which

400
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,839
stains the chitin

401
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,839
and you could see there's more septic

402
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,600
too commonly when you have a branch

403
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,880
not always but commonly you'll have a

404
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,079
septa laden here

405
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:50,559
and here you can see that indeed we had

406
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:54,399
a smaller septal distance when you're

407
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:56,879
treated with this metabolite

408
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,679
we then asked well are there other

409
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:03,278
compounds that could induce branching

410
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:06,719
there had been published in nature

411
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:09,439
about 15 years ago the finding that

412
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,480
plant a plant secondary metabolite

413
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,440
called a

414
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,360
strigolactone and this is just a

415
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,480
variation of the strugolatone

416
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,399
will induce branching and arbuscular

417
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,639
mycorrhizae but just in those

418
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,399
fungi and so we thought well we'd better

419
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,039
check it because we hadn't found another

420
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,278
chemical

421
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,120
and it did nothing it actually did not

422
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,799
induce branching and aspergills

423
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,159
that seems to be specific for the

424
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,240
mycorrhizae

425
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:39,439
so what we next did is we bought or

426
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,079
had our collaborator uh ernst oli um

427
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,600
send us my new amounts of different um

428
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:45,198
oxylipins

429
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,800
and what you see here these top

430
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,838
oxylipins are all

431
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:53,198
vertebrate oxylipins and then

432
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:57,120
these three right here are from fungi

433
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:58,719
this one is from magnaportha aspergillus

434
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,278
and another aspergillus one

435
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,480
and what we found of these oxylipins we

436
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,759
looked at

437
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,880
the branching okay i didn't want to get

438
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,279
to that right yet

439
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,039
the branching was specific to these

440
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,838
fungal oxylipins

441
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,720
and more than one oxylapin could induce

442
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,879
branching it

443
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,959
perhaps um we still don't know exactly

444
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,640
if it's due to the two hydroxyls but

445
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,759
this is really interesting

446
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,160
so specifically because we knew other

447
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:29,279
fungi made these and magnapurtha

448
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,960
grisei the leaf rice

449
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:36,399
blast fungus made eight we asked well

450
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,400
is this branching just um response

451
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,720
uh a response that only aspergillus fema

452
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,759
dot

453
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,839
fema goddess um makes or their other

454
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,960
fungi so we looked at a a few

455
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:53,000
other fungi and we found that one other

456
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,759
um pathogen aspergillose flavous also

457
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,720
significantly branches when exposed to

458
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,798
the phybate

459
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,400
but the other fungi we looked at and you

460
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:00,798
know it's not we didn't look at that

461
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,840
many

462
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:05,679
did not um including magnaportha we

463
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:09,839
didn't see a significant difference

464
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:12,880
in branching however we were bowled over

465
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,918
because any time you added 5

466
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,080
8 8-diode to magnaportha

467
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,120
you immediately got apres psoria

468
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,798
formation

469
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,479
and for those of you who are plant

470
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,679
pathologists you know right away the

471
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,360
aprisoria

472
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,000
are the structures that magnaportha

473
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,839
needs to

474
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,119
penetrate plants something we will be

475
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,678
looking at further

476
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,599
so we found that this compound actually

477
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,480
was a developmental signal for

478
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,480
many fungi

479
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,639
because we knew that oxylipins were

480
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,839
perceived from

481
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,160
by g protein couple receptors the next

482
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,798
thing we did was take a library that

483
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,759
we'd made

484
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,000
some years ago an aspergillus flavus

485
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,839
where

486
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,558
we had deleted the canonical

487
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:02,079
g-protein-coupled receptors of

488
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,678
aspergillus flavus

489
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,639
so if you look right here you can see

490
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,880
again with wild-type when you added

491
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,919
5-8-diode

492
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,440
to aspergillus flavus you had an

493
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,559
increase in branching

494
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,840
and we tested all of these g protein

495
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,359
coupled receptors

496
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,918
and we found three there where there was

497
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,119
not

498
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,840
a response or not a significant response

499
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,798
to the 5 8. what was particularly

500
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,279
interesting that

501
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,639
two of these g protein coupled receptors

502
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,079
gprc

503
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,360
and gprg we had shown earlier

504
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,159
many years earlier to be necessary for

505
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,199
responding

506
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,720
to plant oxylipins so

507
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,720
we believe that these particular

508
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,960
receptors on the surface of the fungus

509
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,839
are involved in perceiving

510
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,840
the fungus's own metabolite

511
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,120
now we were fortunate enough as i say to

512
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,119
have enough of this 5 8 that we

513
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,479
actually went to where we really wanted

514
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,519
to go in the first place

515
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,279
and that was rna seek

516
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,440
actually i had no idea what rna sequence

517
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,240
when i was starting the study because it

518
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,720
wasn't um

519
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,640
had not been when i started working with

520
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,919
oxylipins because it had not been a

521
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,559
technology at the time

522
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,720
but it's a very powerful one as you know

523
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:24,319
we found that treatment with 5 8 and we

524
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,480
did a 30 minute and 120 minute

525
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,000
study because we thought this is it's a

526
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,079
signal things are going to happen right

527
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,720
away and they did we had many many genes

528
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,119
that were

529
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,079
significantly differentially regulated

530
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,798
enough

531
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,960
that we decided what we would do is just

532
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,119
look at the transcription factors

533
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,038
that are differentially regulated this

534
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:48,558
is all an aspergillus fumagotis now

535
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:50,640
we found 35 transcription factors that

536
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,879
were differentially regulated

537
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,559
significantly differentially regulated

538
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,000
now 35 is a lot

539
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,798
but luckily there is a transcription

540
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,279
factor

541
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,158
deletion library in aspergeals fema

542
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,519
goddess

543
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,799
um headed by dr michael bromley and so

544
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:11,200
michael joined our study and we tested

545
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,839
these 35

546
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,159
several times and we came down where

547
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,519
mignow found that there were actually

548
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,159
three of these transcription factors

549
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:24,158
that one deleted did not respond to 5 8

550
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,640
and you can see one for example right

551
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,520
here is one the step one did not respond

552
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,440
this one barely responded these two did

553
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,158
not respond and in fact they actually

554
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,038
had an abnormal branching phenotype

555
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,760
so after finding these three genes she

556
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,960
actually went

557
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:44,158
and extracted rna again just to

558
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,079
confirm the rna seek results

559
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,159
and you can see that two of the genes i

560
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:52,960
just have the transcription factor names

561
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:55,440
hgo5oz or one zero

562
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,720
was induced by five eight uh this one

563
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,400
was induced by five eight and two were

564
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,798
repressed by 5 8. so

565
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,880
what look what did these uh what were

566
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:10,480
the phenotypes when you looked at them

567
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,679
these were the five deletion strains

568
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,720
that did not respond normally

569
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,519
to 5 8. so here's the wild type

570
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,519
the ethanol carrier and the 5 8 and you

571
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:25,119
can see the higher branching

572
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,879
and this particular meta this particular

573
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:30,079
mutant

574
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,880
you can say it was abnormal even as a

575
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,599
without treatment and it did not respond

576
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,200
it was a

577
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,719
hypo brancher a hypobrancher and hyper

578
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,120
branchers

579
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,159
so we became really interested in

580
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,279
exploring these

581
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,480
a little further especially the two

582
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:51,678
that had the most significant response

583
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,400
and what we did let me just go back here

584
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,120
again

585
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,320
is oftentimes with a transcription

586
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,359
factor

587
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:02,240
if you over express it

588
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,918
you can have the opposite phenotype as

589
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,519
when you delete it not always but

590
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,280
sometimes so we said

591
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,960
well let's take this strain which when

592
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,000
you delete it has a

593
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,880
hypo branching and see if we get a hyper

594
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,038
brancher

595
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,159
or likewise what if we take a

596
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,640
hyperbrancher

597
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,840
and when we overexpress it do we get a

598
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,759
hypobrancher

599
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,678
because we reasoned that if you had the

600
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,158
exact opposite phenotype

601
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,798
you actually find a transcription factor

602
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,720
that was

603
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:33,679
very key in regulating branching

604
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,319
and we found one of those what we found

605
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:40,559
is this particular

606
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:42,798
gene 082490 when you overexpressed it

607
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,839
let me just go back again this is our

608
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:49,119
favorite gene

609
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:49,119
when you delete it it's a hypo brancher

610
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,080
and when you over express it it's a

611
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:57,440
hyper brancher

612
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,879
so we are very um thrilled to find this

613
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,159
transcription factor through this

614
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,320
methodology

615
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,919
it turns out had been given a name

616
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,519
before

617
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,120
as zfpa also there had been no research

618
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,839
really focused on this

619
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:14,798
it was just um given that name from a

620
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:18,480
microarray study from another lab

621
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:19,519
and so what we proposed here we end this

622
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,679
study as we

623
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,839
have found to our knowledge the very

624
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,960
first transcription factor

625
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:29,199
that regulates branching and fungi and

626
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,558
that is a downstream

627
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,919
target of fungal oxylipins

628
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,759
where the signal is mediated through

629
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,400
a g protein one or more

630
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:43,839
g-protein-coupled receptors

631
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,519
furthermore we believe that this

632
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:49,839
is um very important as

633
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,200
not only an autocrine signal for the

634
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:55,038
fungus itself

635
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:58,480
what but likely paracrine signaling

636
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:01,200
between microbes or

637
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,679
host tissue that it grows next to what

638
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,480
we're doing right now one of our

639
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,120
big stories here and interests is we

640
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,319
know that

641
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,319
the immune system this is a macrophage

642
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,599
and a neutrophil

643
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:18,158
that they also make oxylipins such as um

644
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,158
prostaglandins and leukotrienes that are

645
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,960
really important in inflammation

646
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,240
and we suspect and are now um

647
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,919
interrogating the

648
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,159
question are the oxylipins from the

649
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,799
aspergillus fema goddess impacting

650
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,360
immune cell response and are oxylipins

651
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:38,000
from the immune cell actually impacting

652
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:40,000
the fungus by controlling branching

653
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,038
what's the fungus inside

654
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,200
we're also really interested um we're

655
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:45,839
inviting a magnapurtha person to work

656
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,720
with us

657
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,839
on asking could the plant the rice

658
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,079
oxylipins

659
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,199
actually be involved and recognized by

660
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,319
magnaportha

661
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,360
as part of the signal to make a

662
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:02,720
aprisorium so that is our

663
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,719
story number one

664
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:10,480
story number two is now going to

665
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:14,000
move into our interests in natural

666
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,120
product signaling between fungi and

667
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
bacteria

668
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,399
and the consequences of that signaling

669
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,558
we're

670
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,798
returning to canonical secondary

671
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:25,278
metabolites now

672
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,000
we actually have three projects in the

673
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,400
lab

674
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,319
um one where we're looking at the soil

675
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,000
microbiome or i could even say plant

676
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,519
microbiome with uh

677
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,200
plant pathogens one the lung microbiome

678
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,000
with human pathogens

679
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,400
and then in a collaboration with ben

680
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,960
wolfe at tufts university the

681
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,880
interesting cheese microbiome with uh

682
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,240
the fungi and bacteria that grow in

683
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,278
cheese rinds

684
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,319
for the sake of time i'm going to focus

685
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:57,440
just on the first one today

686
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:59,599
so how did this get started

687
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,480
we're looking at a bacterium called

688
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,599
ralstonia solanaceaem a very famous wilt

689
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,798
pathogen of

690
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:09,038
many plants and then the mica toxin

691
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,519
producing fusarium and aspergillus

692
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:11,519
strains

693
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,000
okay so this story actually started a

694
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,599
little

695
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,398
accidentally as many studies do

696
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:30,000
when i first moved to wisconsin

697
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:32,798
before the building that i now am um

698
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,720
lodged in is was built i shared a lab in

699
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:38,319
the plant pathology

700
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,038
building with dr caitlin allen who is

701
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,639
very um

702
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,240
a world leader on the bacterium rostonia

703
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,759
solanaceae arum

704
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,480
and of course we are working with

705
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:51,038
aspergillus and fusarium and

706
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,480
the story goes that sometimes there'd be

707
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,480
little contamination of an

708
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,839
aspergillus spore that went into raw

709
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,720
stolen raw

710
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,278
raw estonia play and things happen you

711
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,360
could see

712
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:04,558
that the two microbes responded to each

713
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,839
other

714
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,480
many years later we know what's

715
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,079
happening

716
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,640
between these organisms and

717
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,319
the response of these organisms to each

718
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,720
other is in part

719
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:23,678
mediated by three secondary metabolites

720
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,519
a lipopeptide we call rosyllomycin made

721
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,080
by the bacterium

722
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:30,879
a non-ribosomal peptide we call

723
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:33,439
imazoquin made by aspergillus flavus

724
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,840
and a polyketide made by fiserium

725
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,440
species called by cavern

726
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,439
i want to put a shout out these are

727
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,120
papers are published i won't go into

728
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,278
them into great detail

729
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,519
a shout out to our excellent

730
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:45,919
collaboration with dr frank schrader's

731
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,200
lab

732
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,200
on these projects

733
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,359
so aside

734
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,240
from these natural products there's a

735
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,000
there is a also a visual response when

736
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,919
these organisms grow each other and this

737
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,919
is really important for this story

738
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:10,240
here we have uh rawstonia growing

739
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,080
and here we have aspergillus flavus

740
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,440
growing and if you look at this

741
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,119
particular plate where they're very

742
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,159
close to each other

743
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:21,119
you can see that there's these bumps

744
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,320
all over the mycelium of the fungus

745
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,678
these bumps were so

746
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,359
big that you can see it with the

747
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,600
dissecting scope and

748
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:29,678
maybe even without the dissecting scope

749
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,319
if you can squint

750
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,240
what we found is that the fungus was

751
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,278
producing chlamydospores

752
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,359
when it grew near the bacterium

753
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,319
a chlamydospore for those who are not

754
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:44,398
familiar is a very large

755
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,000
resistant spore to environmental

756
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,158
stresses

757
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,440
it can either grow within the mycelium

758
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,559
intercalary or

759
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,519
terminally it's characterized by a very

760
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,918
thick cell wall with a lot of chitin in

761
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,839
it and

762
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:02,240
usually is a lot of new nuclei in it

763
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,599
well we were really pretty surprised to

764
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,759
see this

765
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,439
because aspergillus is not known for

766
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,759
making clematis spores

767
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,640
some fungi make a lot but most really

768
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,038
weren't known

769
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,880
so when we found this we thought there

770
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,398
was something that the bacterium was

771
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,919
producing

772
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:21,678
that was involved

773
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,520
the other thing and we'll get to that in

774
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,720
one second but the other thing we became

775
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,440
really interested in

776
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,839
was wow these chlamydospores are so big

777
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,880
could

778
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,519
the bacteria possibly be going in so we

779
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,799
got a

780
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:38,879
gfp labeled strain from dr allen

781
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:40,798
and we found that indeed the bacteria

782
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,559
would induce the chlamydospores and then

783
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,038
go inside and this is a

784
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,319
movie of a z-stack we saw some clematis

785
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:51,200
four had hundreds

786
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:54,879
some had thousands of

787
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:58,240
bacteria in it so how uh

788
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,600
did the bacterium induces chlamydia

789
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,319
spores

790
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:07,759
that became our next query and

791
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:09,038
here let's go to the next slide we found

792
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,679
that it was

793
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,640
due to a lipopeptide that the bacterium

794
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,000
made

795
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,080
i'm not going to go through all the

796
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,960
story on this um it's

797
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:21,599
it's published but the bacteria makes a

798
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,600
lipopeptide called raw solomycin

799
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,918
it has anti-fungal effects at high

800
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,319
concentrations

801
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,399
and it induces the formation of the

802
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,720
chlamydospores and the bacterium then

803
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:32,719
enter

804
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,558
the chlamydospores if you delete the

805
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,839
genes and the bacterium

806
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:40,240
so you no longer have the lipopeptide

807
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,199
there's no antifungal effect and the

808
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,839
hyphae is

809
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,440
nice and pristine with no clematis

810
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:49,678
spores

811
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,159
this seemed to us at the time that

812
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,200
perhaps um

813
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,360
not necessarily something that was

814
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,240
helpful for the fungus or oh well i i

815
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,158
guess you could

816
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,480
it was six and one half a dozen of the

817
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,600
other there's that anti-fungal effect

818
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,399
but chlamydospores are spores that

819
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,038
um are very resistant to abiotic

820
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:11,199
stresses

821
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,200
cold heat acceptor but if a lot of

822
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,399
bacteria go in it is that

823
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,759
going to obfuscicate

824
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:21,759
the i would say the advantage of making

825
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,720
these

826
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,200
so we wanted to ask what does the fungus

827
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,839
do

828
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,919
when confronted with ralph solomycin and

829
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,839
here again we um

830
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,919
actually did another rna-seq where we

831
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,599
grew the fungus either with uh

832
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,278
russell amycin present or without

833
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:39,359
rosolomycin and we looked

834
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:40,640
for genes that were significantly up or

835
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,000
down regulated

836
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,399
and one was very interesting to us was a

837
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,038
secondary metabolite gene cluster that

838
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:52,158
is normally never expressed

839
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:54,158
to high degrees in the fungus and it was

840
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,880
but it to some degree but it was down

841
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,039
regulated by raw solomycin

842
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,880
we're able to characterize this as this

843
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:04,798
non-ribosomal peptide called

844
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,840
emazoquin and um to make a long story

845
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:10,879
short from this particular paper

846
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:13,918
we found that emisoquins are actually

847
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,919
important for quick

848
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,960
spore germinatement germination and

849
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,960
aspergillus

850
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,159
and they inhibit the growth of raw

851
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,200
solamycin

852
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,399
whereas raw solamycin made by ralstonia

853
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,720
actually inhibits

854
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:29,439
the expression of this compound that

855
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,278
inhibits the growth of the bacterium

856
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,880
so this is a really interesting

857
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,599
antagonism between

858
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,640
two natural products that respond to

859
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,038
each other

860
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,038
in this case it seemed like perhaps in

861
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:45,119
favor of the

862
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:48,158
bacterium now as we are working on this

863
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,678
we notice that in the fusion species the

864
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,720
chlamydospores which are

865
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,919
smaller than aspergills but many of them

866
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,079
all turned red just about here's one

867
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,320
that's not red yet but it will turn red

868
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,398
and here's the bacterium it also enters

869
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,879
inside this chlamydosporo the bacterium

870
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,518
goes in

871
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,080
all chlamydospores so we wondered what

872
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,239
this

873
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:13,199
red compound was and um

874
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,479
we were able to do some imaging and

875
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,838
found out that this

876
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,878
compound was a fungal

877
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,960
polyketide known as by cavern it had

878
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:26,159
already been discovered but we

879
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,440
nobody had shown that it was responsive

880
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,639
to

881
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,918
raw solomycin you can see here that this

882
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,760
treatment where we have the fungus in

883
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,279
the bacterium

884
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,359
the bicavern is really produced in great

885
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,200
amounts right at the edge

886
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:46,838
where the chlamydospores are formed

887
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,000
what we found is that opposite of

888
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:50,239
aspergillus

889
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,239
that

890
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:58,239
keeps flicking very quickly here um

891
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:00,838
we found that this by cavern gene

892
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,479
cluster is actually induced by

893
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:04,719
rossolomycin and

894
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,320
we thought maybe this was giving the

895
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:09,279
fungus some advantage

896
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,559
so we deleted the bicavern genes in

897
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,480
fusarium

898
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,000
and then we looked at rawstonia growth

899
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,800
and confrontation with wild-type

900
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,880
fusarium

901
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,519
or a few serum that lack by cavern and

902
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,039
you can see that actually

903
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:26,800
the the bacterium grew

904
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,800
better when there was no bicarbonate

905
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:35,279
this one is a little complex here um

906
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,880
right here oh my goodness gracious

907
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,560
um we also showed that raw solomycin

908
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,480
induced as i said by cavern production

909
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,159
and fusarium

910
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,719
one thing that's really interesting is

911
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:51,358
by cavern is always known to be

912
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,319
inhibited by high nitrogen but if you

913
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,239
add raw

914
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,039
uh raw solamycin it will allow the

915
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:59,039
fungus to make more by cavern

916
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,440
and here we you can see the vicarin

917
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,880
genes are induced when you add raw solar

918
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,800
mycin

919
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:10,720
so we went on to show then

920
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,480
that by cavern oh i showed you this a

921
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:15,759
little earlier

922
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,480
that by cavern reduced rawstonia growth

923
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,599
this is with

924
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,079
whole extracts of the fungus but we also

925
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,160
got purified by cavern and showed that

926
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,119
purified by cavern actually

927
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:29,519
reduced bacterial growth so we concluded

928
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:33,200
from this particular interaction

929
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:35,199
that yes the um in this case raw stony

930
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:37,118
induced the chlamydia spores infusion

931
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,559
just as it does in every fungus and the

932
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,440
bacteria would enter

933
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:43,199
but in the case of fusarium it actually

934
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,480
would induce the production

935
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:49,519
of a polyketide only in the

936
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,199
chlamydosport where the bacteria entered

937
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:54,320
and reduced the population

938
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:57,358
the number of bacteria

939
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,280
so these studies are all published

940
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,960
and i want to end though with a

941
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,960
continuation of this work

942
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,920
by another student in the lab

943
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,440
nandita venkatesh so just to reiterate

944
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,599
again i i think i'd mention that

945
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,358
ralstonia of course is a wilt pathogen

946
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,760
but so is fusarium

947
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,880
so one thing that nandita has been

948
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,599
looking at is

949
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,440
well what happens when you have these

950
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,200
two

951
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,039
pathogens together knowing that

952
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,118
rawstonia can actually enter a

953
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,079
chlamydosporo of fusarium at least in

954
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,200
the laboratory

955
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:36,480
and what is by cavern doing so

956
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,439
this is work that is um in preparation

957
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,800
by

958
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,760
mandita one thing that

959
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:48,320
we found is that when you have raw

960
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,320
stonya it does kill tomatoes immediately

961
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,880
fucerimoxyspring is a slower killer but

962
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,880
it will eventually but when you mix them

963
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,480
together it looked more like a

964
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,480
fusarium phenotype

965
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,800
and what she has found and we're still

966
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,320
doing some work on this

967
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:09,119
is that for reasons yet to be explained

968
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,119
when you mix

969
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:18,079
fusarium and rawstonia together you

970
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:21,519
actually reduce the high severe

971
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:24,320
severity of a bacterial wilt

972
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,000
disease but it is a little bit more than

973
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,320
the fungus by itself

974
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,239
and then she went ahead to do a

975
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,440
co-culture with ralstonia

976
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:36,239
and the bicavern mutant of fusarium

977
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,559
and there's actually a bit more will so

978
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,919
it

979
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:43,039
appears that by cavern actually

980
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,358
is reducing to some degree the severity

981
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:47,838
of

982
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,838
wilt disease by rostonia

983
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,200
we then um she's not quite finished with

984
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,519
this yet but

985
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,559
we started to ask well okay is there any

986
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:02,000
benefit

987
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:04,559
to the bacterium

988
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,119
when it's in the soil where presumably

989
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,480
it is

990
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,640
with the fusarium and so

991
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,240
the we have found that in this little

992
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,759
mini winter

993
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:18,239
study that the ralstonia

994
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,960
does grow better when fucerum is there

995
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:22,239
which we

996
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,320
hypothesize is because of the

997
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,279
ability to enter and survive in the

998
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,519
chlamydospores

999
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,920
of the fungus now to really get

1000
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,000
deep into understanding what's happening

1001
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,200
with this interaction with the

1002
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,440
bacterium and the chlamydospores

1003
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,919
indeed has gotten really much further

1004
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,880
and we're very shortly to submit this

1005
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,200
work

1006
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,000
here is just a time lapse where you can

1007
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,960
see

1008
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
the chlamydospores forming in fungal

1009
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,639
mycelium

1010
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,559
when it's added to russell when raw

1011
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:57,679
solomycin is added

1012
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:01,519
nandita found it takes minimal amounts

1013
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:03,118
of rascola mycin way less than the

1014
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,119
bacteria makes to induce these

1015
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,480
chlamydospores here you can see it

1016
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,720
what um way down at this

1017
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,960
molarity we still get significant

1018
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,519
numbers of raw solar mice of

1019
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,199
chlamydospores and the bacteria makes a

1020
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:19,519
much higher amount than this

1021
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,759
so we first wanted to see okay you know

1022
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,079
how many chlamydospores do you get and

1023
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,960
what molarity of russell mycen do you

1024
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,880
need

1025
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,000
and then what nandita did is she

1026
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,358
developed a

1027
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,400
z-stacking methodology so she could

1028
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,598
see the bacteria going inside the

1029
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,680
chlamydospore

1030
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,480
and why she did this you can see right

1031
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:43,919
here is we had a hypothesis that

1032
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,079
oh well if oscillomycin is in the soil

1033
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,838
could other bacteria get inside the

1034
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,039
fungus or is it limited to

1035
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:53,519
raw solar mice ralstonia and she found

1036
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,960
a lot of bacteria could go inside the

1037
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,039
chlamydia spores here we have

1038
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,480
pseudomonas originosa opportunistic

1039
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,599
human pathogen

1040
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,719
and herba spirulium which is a nitrogen

1041
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,720
fixing bacterium

1042
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,440
what she did is went through and

1043
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,519
examined as many gram-negative and

1044
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,599
gram-positive bacteria that we could

1045
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:16,639
find from researchers in the lab

1046
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,280
and we have a little story here

1047
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,318
she found we were able to look at three

1048
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,519
gram positive

1049
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:25,199
they never enter the chlamydis spore

1050
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,960
and then she looked at five different

1051
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,439
gram negatives and all

1052
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,639
except for this one bacillus will enter

1053
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,358
the climatospore

1054
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,960
so it seemed to be that many a broad

1055
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,719
range of these bacteria

1056
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,079
and what was interesting to us is when

1057
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:40,000
she looked at these and looked at a

1058
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,000
phylogenetic tree

1059
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,440
the fungi that went inside the chlamydia

1060
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,480
spore are

1061
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,679
not were never known to be

1062
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,920
endo fungal bacteria before so in red

1063
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,838
are the known endofungal bacteria

1064
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,960
but we found that rawstonia

1065
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,559
herbaspirelium

1066
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,679
e coli and pseudomonas also went inside

1067
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:04,159
we believe this is the first time it um

1068
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,159
there's evidence for these fungi to

1069
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,239
enter bacteria

1070
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:10,318
so is this something that's just limited

1071
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,479
to raw solomycin

1072
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,960
um nandita looked in the literature and

1073
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,400
she found that there's many lipopeptides

1074
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,079
and here's just some of them

1075
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,280
that have been reported in the

1076
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,800
literature to induce chlamydospores

1077
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,040
so we started to think could this

1078
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,280
actually be widespread

1079
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,159
and what we are able to do she's able to

1080
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,720
do

1081
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:35,759
is get a um isolated bacillus

1082
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,239
the wild type that made um fingerson

1083
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,920
that

1084
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:40,639
had been shown to induce chlamydia

1085
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,880
spores and one that was deleted for

1086
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:47,199
producing fingerson and we found that

1087
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,880
indeed when you had fingerson and this

1088
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,759
happens to be with a flavus and

1089
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,960
pseudomonas originosa we get

1090
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,000
chlamydospores and pseudomonas

1091
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,159
enters inside the chlamydis spores this

1092
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,599
is getting very exciting to us ah

1093
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:03,318
there's a lot going on here maybe this

1094
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,838
is very common there's a lot of

1095
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:10,800
lipopeptides a lot of bacteria

1096
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:12,960
a lot of bacteria going inside

1097
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,000
the next thing she wanted to ask was

1098
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,960
well

1099
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,800
will a clematis spore only house one

1100
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,079
bacterium or could there be more than

1101
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,640
one bacterium

1102
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,599
so this is a case where we either she

1103
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:28,559
either co-inf um

1104
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,519
co-cultured ralstonia and aspergil

1105
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:31,920
salone or

1106
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,759
pseudomonas and aspergillus or both

1107
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,039
ralstonia and pseudomonas

1108
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,440
and what we find is they both go inside

1109
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,838
she did note that when they were

1110
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,838
introduced

1111
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:47,118
sort of would change the ver the ratio

1112
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,760
of how much each bacterium

1113
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,240
so here we have a situation in e where

1114
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,200
we just had the fungus and rostonia

1115
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:57,199
and um she waited a certain time period

1116
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,439
and found about fifteen percent of the

1117
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:02,239
clematis spores were colonized

1118
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,519
when she co-incubated roth ralstoni and

1119
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,159
pseudomonas

1120
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,358
um she found and now she's just counting

1121
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:09,039
rostonia

1122
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,480
that there was an increase in the number

1123
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:13,679
of ralstonia

1124
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,480
that were inside the clematis force she

1125
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:16,879
then

1126
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,838
did the same experiment but she allowed

1127
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,200
pseudomonas

1128
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:23,920
to arrive at the

1129
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,598
fungal court earlier than rostonia and

1130
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,880
when she did that

1131
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:32,559
we saw an increase in the number of

1132
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,960
pseudomonas so we think that

1133
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,480
obviously more than one bacterium can go

1134
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,280
inside the

1135
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,199
chlamydosport but the relative amount of

1136
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,240
which bacterium is there might depend on

1137
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:46,480
which bacterium

1138
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,799
arrive first the last thing she looked

1139
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,639
at

1140
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,119
is asked does this colonization

1141
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,078
really um does it give any advantage to

1142
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,519
the bacterium

1143
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,680
we had a little hint earlier that it did

1144
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,639
but she wanted to look at this a little

1145
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:03,440
bit further under controlled

1146
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:07,598
experimentation

1147
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:11,200
and here we have an example of

1148
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,599
the impact growing

1149
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,679
the bacterium with the funguses under

1150
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,519
starvation conditions

1151
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,960
so what she did here let's just look at

1152
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:22,159
the raw

1153
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,519
ralstonian flavous interaction

1154
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,920
she would grow the bacterium

1155
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,239
either a wild type bacterium that made

1156
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,039
raw solomycin or this one that does not

1157
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:35,838
make real solomycin so no chlamydospores

1158
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,559
and when she grew them in a situation

1159
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:40,639
where there was

1160
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:46,000
lots of nutrients for the bacterium

1161
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:48,639
both the wild-type bacterium and the um

1162
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,760
the bacterium lacking raw solomycin grew

1163
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,960
equally

1164
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,839
with aspergillus flavous however when

1165
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,000
she grew them

1166
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:58,159
under a situation where there was no

1167
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,280
nutrients under starvation

1168
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:04,078
you can see here that the bacterium that

1169
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,079
actually made roscolomycin and could

1170
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,119
therefore go into chlamydospores

1171
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,280
grew much better than the poor bacterium

1172
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,680
without a lipopeptide

1173
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,359
she found exactly the same thing with

1174
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:18,480
pseudomonas originosa

1175
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:20,799
so this suggested to us that the

1176
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,240
bacterium actually does receive

1177
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,519
some benefit by being able to enter

1178
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,719
inside the back

1179
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:32,639
inside the chlamydospore

1180
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:34,719
so i gave you a lot of what she has um

1181
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:35,679
worked on there's some other tests she

1182
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,318
did but i

1183
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:39,838
would like to conclude with this second

1184
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:42,400
story right now

1185
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,679
by saying what we think is happening we

1186
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,440
believe that this is

1187
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:50,639
widespread in nature um that actually

1188
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,519
chlamydif spore formation in fungi is

1189
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,000
induced by

1190
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,960
lipopeptides that are made by many

1191
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,039
bacteria

1192
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:02,079
it allows bacteria one or more than one

1193
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:05,039
to enter inside a

1194
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:07,200
fungal chlamydospore it will protect

1195
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:08,880
them in different environments and we

1196
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,799
we think of the soil we started with

1197
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,480
soil but of course

1198
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,560
all the microbes we were working with

1199
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,679
are actually those that could be found

1200
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:19,279
in the human microbiome or in even

1201
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,598
other places such as the cheese

1202
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,559
microbiome and

1203
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:29,280
we are now about as i say to submit this

1204
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,119
that we believe that we should consider

1205
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,720
the

1206
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:38,160
chlamydospore as having its own

1207
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:41,919
bacterial microbiome inside

1208
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:46,078
it so i

1209
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,838
will uh stop with those two stories i i

1210
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,119
do have more but i'm conscious of the

1211
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:52,960
time here

1212
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,680
so i just want to end this talk and show

1213
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,838
you what

1214
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:57,838
it looks like when there is no covavirus

1215
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,719
at madison which we hope will come back

1216
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,039
again

1217
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,118
um i show in red the two people who

1218
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:06,639
really actually did most of the work

1219
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:09,358
menial for the oxylipid branching

1220
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,318
signaling and nandita for this really

1221
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:13,679
exciting

1222
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:15,838
bacterial fungal microbiome

1223
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,679
listed in yellow are those that helped

1224
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,799
menial during our

1225
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,598
coven crisis i also want to shout out to

1226
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,440
frank

1227
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,680
schrader because a lot of the work that

1228
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,358
i mentioned some of our earlier work has

1229
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:30,799
been crucial for helping

1230
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:33,199
and with menial also dr um oli

1231
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,880
nupsila sweden who actually made some

1232
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,639
oxylippins for us and

1233
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,680
dave bibi who helped us with some

1234
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:42,799
microfluidic devices

1235
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:46,960
and with that i'm happy to take

1236
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:49,039
any questions nancy thank you very much

1237
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,280
what a terrific

1238
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,960
seminar there we really appreciate it so

1239
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,640
uh i'm sure they'll

1240
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,440
i don't see anything in the chat room

1241
00:48:54,639 --> 00:49:02,000
yet but i'd encourage anybody to

1242
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:05,760
put your questions in the chat room

1243
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,358
nancy always proud of you

1244
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:12,960
today is no exception

1245
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:16,480
um regarding the first story

1246
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:20,159
and the transcription factor induced

1247
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:23,280
by the oxylipin yes do you have

1248
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:26,759
any idea about the

1249
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:30,559
conservation of that uh

1250
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:34,000
transcription factor across fungi

1251
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:37,040
um we do have a little bit of an idea

1252
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,039
about that it's um

1253
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:42,639
honestly we looked in aspergillus flavus

1254
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,240
and it's there so one of the next

1255
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:47,598
studies will be to see if it also

1256
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:47,598
regulates branching there

1257
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:54,159
it does seem to be um pretty good

1258
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,400
homologs and ascomyces

1259
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:58,078
so it'd be really interesting to look in

1260
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,280
some other fungi to see

1261
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:04,559
what it does with them yeah and

1262
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:07,599
are there any other morphological

1263
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:11,519
developmental effects other than

1264
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:14,400
branching and possibly across orion

1265
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:14,960
yes there are and i'm glad you asked

1266
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,440
that

1267
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,199
um what i didn't tell you is that this

1268
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,240
is a signal for

1269
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:26,679
inducing secondary metabolism too

1270
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:29,679
we're really excited about that we um

1271
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:31,838
hypothesize well so a lot of the the

1272
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:34,960
canonical secondary metabolites

1273
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:36,480
um we believe um there's lots of

1274
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,159
evidence to suggest

1275
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,280
well some evidence that they're

1276
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:43,279
associated with the endocytic pathway

1277
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,599
and we think they're associated with the

1278
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,559
growing tips and septa

1279
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,000
and so we're we will be exploring that

1280
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,880
further

1281
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,960
calcium signaling too there's a lot of

1282
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,400
calcium signaling

1283
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,400
genes that are upregulated

1284
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,400
gary are you seeing questions yes there

1285
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,880
are

1286
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,440
a couple questions here so uh you've got

1287
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,760
a couple of

1288
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,800
applauses i shall say uh there's a

1289
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,160
question here

1290
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:16,960
how uh from saeed um how

1291
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:17,920
will uh rastonia be freed from the

1292
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,199
clemence four

1293
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,000
can it easily go in and out or does it

1294
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,358
need to await

1295
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,639
germination of the clematis or to

1296
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:29,838
escape oh that's an excellent question

1297
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:33,759
and i don't have

1298
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:37,199
an 100 answer for this

1299
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,920
now nandita has sometimes but sometimes

1300
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,000
not

1301
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,480
seen as the fungus germinates the

1302
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,599
bacterium traveling through the hyphae

1303
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,639
not all the time but sometimes i suspect

1304
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,280
that

1305
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:51,679
this does happen on occasion so when

1306
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,359
that chlamydosport germinates and

1307
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:57,519
i should break oh man you like get 10 to

1308
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,239
15 germ tubes coming out of it it's so

1309
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,280
big

1310
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:04,318
that the bacteria can go out that way

1311
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,680
maybe it can also go out through cell

1312
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:09,199
wall remodeling too

1313
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:10,399
with that we don't know yet so a

1314
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:14,318
follow-up question there

1315
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,280
uh from uh raleigh is any ideas on how

1316
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:17,199
the bacteria

1317
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,640
enter the spore and then can you

1318
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:21,679
speculate why gram

1319
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:24,799
positives cannot gain access

1320
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:27,199
yeah um so

1321
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,240
we have some ideas that we want to

1322
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:31,039
follow up on

1323
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:32,479
um i don't know if nandita will she does

1324
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:35,679
want to graduate but

1325
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,400
we're wondering if some of the type 3 or

1326
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:40,318
some of the secretion systems in the

1327
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,440
bacteria are important

1328
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,558
so gram positive and gram nega have have

1329
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,960
different

1330
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,000
secretion systems maybe that's part of

1331
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,039
it

1332
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,800
the gram positives um

1333
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:54,480
i don't think this is why it stops them

1334
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,640
from going inside

1335
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,480
but they do we have some nice pictures

1336
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,480
where they like to stick on the hyphy on

1337
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,440
the outside of the fungus but

1338
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,800
that shouldn't preclude them we're

1339
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,358
thinking it might have something to do

1340
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:10,079
with these

1341
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:12,159
uh secretion systems of the bacteria

1342
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,359
great and and maria harrison asked a

1343
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,078
very similar question

1344
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:16,960
stephen higgins said you get a great

1345
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,280
talk

1346
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,318
uh obviously not all raw estonia enter

1347
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,160
the clementosport

1348
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:24,318
are there any nutrient signals in these

1349
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:25,838
spores that attract some ralstonia over

1350
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:29,199
others

1351
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:32,480
we don't know that

1352
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:32,799
one thing we want to ask in the future

1353
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,039
is

1354
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,160
the chlamydospores have a lot of lipid

1355
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,400
bodies in them

1356
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:40,239
they're just chock full of lipids and

1357
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,720
we're guessing the bacteria

1358
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:43,519
might be living off of the lipid body so

1359
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,039
we want to

1360
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,960
there's several ways we could address

1361
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,800
that question

1362
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,280
but we don't have anything specific

1363
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,280
right now

1364
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:56,400
i don't see any other questions in there

1365
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:58,400
right now i want to remind you nancy

1366
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,639
that this your talk has been recorded so

1367
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,838
we'll be sure to get you that recording

1368
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:04,318

00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:06,558

1370
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:07,440
that sounds wonderful and i'm sure i

1371
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,480
know i'm meeting with some of the

1372
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,880
postdocs and grad

1373
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,079
students yeah so i see that you're right

1374

on the button there it's supposed to

1375
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,119
start at 1 45 but what i

1376
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,480
why don't i suggest that uh you'll need

1377
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,920
a little bit of a break

1378
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,639

1379
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,480
