1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,638
University morning

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,440
everyone glad to have a chance to talk

4
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,278
with you about deer and deer related

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,800
impacts uh I've been involved with deer

6
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:20,879
research on campus for about 25 years

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,560
and it's a a constant problem that

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,599
doesn't seem to go away it only gets

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,198
worse in many parts of the state so I

10
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:28,920
want to talk about a a bit on deer

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,960
biology and management and some of the

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,679
things that we've done Loc Al over the

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,280
last few years in terms of research to

14
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,159
try to get ahead of some of these issues

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,879
and we're far from solving the problem

16
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,159
uh but I think when a couple local

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,558
communities were starting to make some

18
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,718
inroads you're all aware there's lots of

19
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,679
associated impacts with deer from health

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,960
and safety and economic standpoint deer

21
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,519
vehicle collisions are the biggest one

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,039
and uh we estimate on New York highways

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,280
we hit probably 100,000 deer year nobody

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,920
knows there are no exact figures because

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,039
every municipality every police

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,039
organization tend to tally things a

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,040
little bit differently we worked with

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,118
Aon markets and New York Farm Bureau and

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,560
did a survey of deer damaged agriculture

30
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:12,680
back and the early 2000s and realized

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,680
that deer at that time were causing

32
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,439
about $59 million a year an economic

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,600
impacts agriculture in New York state in

34
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:22,199
the plant industry alone if you look at

35
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:25,000
uh the horiculture industry probably

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,000
roughly around $10 million of losses so

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,478
again these are pretty large economic

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,560
impacts for one species we're going to

39
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:34,679
talk about damaged uh primarily Woody

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,799
ornamentals and perennials today Forest

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,320
regeneration failure is another big

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,799
issue with deer we've got a current

43
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,879
project with New York State DEC looking

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,719
at uh trying to assess Deer Forest

45
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:49,280
impacts and Forest regeneration failures

46
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:51,000
and if you change Habitat then that

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,399
influences things like song birds

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,359
reptiles and amphibians and if you

49
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,560
change the species diversity of small

50
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,519
mammals that really influences ticks and

51
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,519
tick porn diseases so all these things

52
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,280
tend to be interrelated and we'll touch

53
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,840
a little bit on all of them so what can

54
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,399
we do if you've got deer problems in

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,120
around your community uh there it really

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,479
depends on the scale um for example on

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,280
an individual property probably the most

58
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,079
cost effective thing are some type of

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,759
exclusion devices and we'll talk about

60
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,560
each of these people have tried

61
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,120
frightening devices with pretty poor

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,080
success plant selection I'll touch on

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,759
some things Mark uh bridon is going to

64
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,160
follow up later with some more detailed

65
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,679
list on uh plants that tend to be deer

66
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,680
resistant I'll talk about repellence and

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,879
population control and if you think of

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,040
an IPM context what you're trying to do

69
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:42,039
is look at the best combination of

70
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,759
what's available that fits your

71
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:47,799
landscape or your property uh to try to

72
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:50,759
get the the damage down to a tolerable

73
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,640
level so exclusion uh can be something

74
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,479
as simple as say black heavy netting on

75
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,799
metal stakes and a a garden small garden

76
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,560
kitchen Garden type of bed people have

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,640
tried mon filament lines on different

78
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,120
configurations uh deer tend to figure

79
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,238
those out pretty quickly they so they

80
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,200
tend uh not to work very long all sorts

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,360
of types of fencing High tensil woven

82
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,759
wire is the most expensive it's also the

83
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,760
most resilient to Deer damage and all

84
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,878
sorts of other metal and wire guards

85
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:20,439
that you might see commercially sold uh

86
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,079
but if you can keep the deer away from

87
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,239
the plant materials at the times when

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,319
they're sensitive that generally solves

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,120
the problem over the Long

90
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,479
Haul frightening devices you'll see all

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,200
sorts of these squawk boxes that emit

92
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,039
sounds that are supposed to scare deer

93
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,119
we tested a a shuru device years ago

94
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,840
that was supposedly scare scaring deer

95
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,640
out of apple orchard that did absolutely

96
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,280
nothing most of the auditory devices

97
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,079
deer are smart they figure out what's

98
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,759
real danger and what's not if they hear

99
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,959
a noise several times nothing happens

100
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:52,359
they're not going to pay any attention

101
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,759
to it visual repellents the same thing

102
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,079
I've seen people put coyote decoys out

103
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,280
and around their farm and planting golf

104
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,719
courses I've seen them use these coyotes

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,719
to keep uh deer and geese away and both

106
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,039
the deer and geese quickly figure out

107
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,039
that though our decoys are not real they

108
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:10,679
present no real danger and so they're

109
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,679
waste of time and money odor repellants

110
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,480
are useful we'll talk about about that

111
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,478
when I get to the repellent section and

112
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,079
then Ultrasonics and I'll talk a bit

113
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,519
more about that um Ultrasonics haven't

114
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,040
shown to have any real success with deer

115
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,720
um but I'll mention it briefly when we

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,360
get to the vehicle collisions lots of

117
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,880
repellants most of the products today

118
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,360
are formulated with uh the the generally

119
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,759
regarded as safe materials because they

120
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,800
avoid EPA registration with the grass

121
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,439
listed compound unfortunately most of

122
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,400
them have never been tested under

123
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,639
replicated experimental sings and I

124
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,198
would doubt uh looking at active

125
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,079
ingredients allow those things work at

126
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,240
all there is one chemo sterilin

127
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,758
registered for deer nationally by a

128
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,560
federal EPA but it's not registered New

129
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,520
York gonacon uh imuno contraceptive

130
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,918
vaccine is registered but but not used

131
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,680
in very many states it was an

132
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,359
experimental drug for controlling deer

133
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,079
populations high cost High expense

134
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,038
continued maintenance and it just you

135
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:13,680
know just the delivery system isn't that

136
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:15,519
great terms of population control most

137
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,560
state wildlife agencies New York

138
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,120
included will uh try to First solve

139
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,280
problems with manage hunting and there's

140
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,079
lots of different ways to hunt deer you

141
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:26,478
have to focus on the female segment of

142
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,839
the herd cuz that's your reproductive

143
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,240
segment it's going to control your

144
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,359
population biology so you can do things

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,478
like dmps your regular dough tags that

146
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,879
any hunter uh can get in most parts of

147
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,199
the state if you go up a level more

148
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,600
intensive management Dem deer management

149
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,800
assistant program tag those are ant list

150
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,800
only tags issued to individual land

151
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,918
owners usually Farm or Forest land

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,319
owners we had them on University

153
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:53,198
properties for many years and they allow

154
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,240
you to take a specific number of ant

155
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,079
steering during the regular hunting

156
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,600
season and the landowner applies for the

157
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:01,800
tags used to be I think a 50 acre

158
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,479
minimum acreage requirement give the

159
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,520
tags out recruit hunters and try to

160
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,758
remove anist deer the next step in up in

161
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,560
aggressiveness is deer damage permits

162
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,639
these are tags to be used outside the

163
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,439
normal hunting season most of the

164
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,199
permits are given out for agricultural

165
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,079
grower uh for example you got a

166
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,879
strawberry grower going to try to get a

167
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,000
crop off in June and deer are coming in

168
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,879
at night hammering the strawberry they

169
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,639
can apply for a deer damage permit

170
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,680
they're usually issued very quickly set

171
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,800
number of tags decided on by the

172
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,360
regional d you see deer biologist and

173
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,639
these are non-hunting methods it allows

174
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,479
the use of bait artificial lights

175
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,519
shooting at night usually till 11:00

176
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:43,598
p.m. uh the dec will look at the damage

177
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,879
estimate number of tags needed if the

178
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:48,079
the land owner got safe shooting zones

179
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,159
and then finally deer management Focus

180
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,439
area the last thing that was started in

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,599
2012 the only one in the state right now

182
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,879
is here in Tomkins County area we have a

183
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:58,560
special uh deer Focus area because we've

184
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,439
done so much research and management

185
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,680
activity what that allows is any

186
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,000
licensed Big Game Hunter in New York

187
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,519
state can apply and get free analist

188
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,240
tags online from the DC website if they

189
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,359
register and every Hunter can take two

190
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,840
analyst deer per day every day of the

191
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,639
entire hunting season and addition they

192
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:21,239
can take two analist deer per day during

193
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,120
a special 3-we January season that's the

194
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,240
only one January season in Upstate New

195
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,639
York so again we're putting a ton of

196
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,840
hunting effort in this area has it done

197
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,120
any good in reducing our deer impact I

198
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,799
would say no hasn't made a measurable

199
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,720
difference and that's one of the points

200
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,879
I want to try to get across usually

201
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,639
hunting programs alone no matter how

202
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,039
intensive they are just usually don't

203
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,360
they help there's no doubt they help but

204
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,318
they aren't going to solve a problem

205
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,919
because deer smart they figure out the

206
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,720
safe havens very quickly and you and you

207
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:54,519
got to be smart and know deer behavior

208
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,960
and how to hunt deer and a a handful of

209
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:59,719
skilled Hunters on a damage permit can

210
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,680
do more than 400 Hunters on regular

211
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,560
hunting season it's just the way it is

212
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,598
and I'll show you some data in a little

213
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,639
while deer related vehicle accidents um

214
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:12,199
Nationwide back in the early 90s there

215
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,840
was a national survey done it was

216
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,680
estimated there were 726 th000

217
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:20,119
Nationwide uh but Dan Decker uh did some

218
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,800
surveys here in New York and found that

219
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,038
of the uh accidents that actually

220
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,879
occurred only to 20 to 50% ever got

221
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,959
reported anywhere on a police database

222
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,720
or an insurance claim and so we

223
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,278
conservatively say Well about half the

224
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,080
accidents got reported for that

225
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:39,559
726000 all jumps up to a million and a

226
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,240
half likely deer accidents in a single

227
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:44,919
year that number is probably gone up and

228
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,120
at an average cost back then of $3,000

229
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:49,919
per vehicle for repairs that's 4.5

230
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,919
billion in economic losses annually I

231
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,079
just saw some current data now on

232
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,519
average uh based on insurance records

233
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,519
about $66,000 per vehicle on average for

234
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,519
repair so those numbers have just all

235
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,799
escalated over over

236
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,839
time we know a lot about deer Behavior

237
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:07,519
we know 60% of the deer vehicle

238
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,079
accidents that occur in New York every

239
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,480
year are going to occur during October

240
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:13,199
November and December and November is

241
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,360
the worth month every year what's going

242
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,800
on in November that causes

243
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,000
that rough it's a mating season bucks

244
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,599
are chasing do the deer aren't paying

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,600
attention they're Crossing roads more

246
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,360
frequently and more get hit also that

247
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,560
what's going on when you get to the

248
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,278
change in uh the daylight savings time

249
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,759
and standard time it puts the peak in

250
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,278
Deer activity at sunrise and sunset

251
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,919
right at the peak of driving time

252
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,720
morning and evening and so the

253
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:40,879
combination of those two things causes

254
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,839
accidents to really Spike at that time

255
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,559
of year there's another little blip

256
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,399
these data don't pick up right here in

257
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:51,559
May and June there's actually if you had

258
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,480
real data for it we pick it up from our

259
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:56,239
Collard deer what's going on in late May

260
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,240
early

261
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,200
June fawning season so what happens

262
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,120
before the adult female deer gives birth

263
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,040
to this year's fond she kicks last

264
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,679
year's fonds out of her home range and

265
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,199
so you've got yearling deer for the

266
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,719
first time with no mother and they have

267
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,240
to go out and set up their own territory

268
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,680
and they're wandering everywhere just

269
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,799
watch the main Highway Quarters on 81

270
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,359
I90 just watch and you'll see that blip

271
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,599
if you're if you watch particularly at

272
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,879
that time of

273
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,079
year so what can we do education for

274
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,559
Motors is really important they get lots

275
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,159
of PSAs and announcements out the

276
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,399
problem is we don't change our Behavior

277
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:37,278
very readily look how long it took and

278
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,320
how much enforcement it took to put seat

279
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,320
belt walls in place look how about

280
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,200
enforcement on texting and driving and

281
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,839
calling and uh trying to call on your

282
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,879
phone and driving just education alone

283
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,720
just doesn't solve it unless you've got

284
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:52,600
enforcement behind it got to be careful

285
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,079
driving near dawn or dust peak times a

286
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,480
deer activity deer creatur is a habit

287
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,039
where you see deer across the road once

288
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,200
you're likely to see him again in your

289
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,719
your normal daily travel so again note

290
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,480
those places in the back of your mind

291
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,160
when you're traveling to work or school

292
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,639
or wherever scan the roadsides for I

293
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:11,679
Reflections know what those look like at

294
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,159
night that might give an extra two

295
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,519
seconds to slow down if you can

296
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,958
recognize an eye reflection and miss a

297
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,759
deer uh versus having an accident and I

298
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:22,278
always encourage communities to manage

299
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,078
her density where possible because it's

300
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:26,159
a direct density dependent function the

301
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,599
higher deer density on the landscape the

302
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,958
higher probability of contact you're

303
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,440
going to have on highp speed

304
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:34,599
highways bells and whistles don't work

305
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,360
there's lots of Ultrasonics and gimmicks

306
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,120
that have been sold over the year none

307
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,200
of these things have any effect on deer

308
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,959
Behavior Uh it's not even clear that

309
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,759
deer can hear in the ultrasonic range

310
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:47,919
that these devices produce think about

311
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,159
animals that communicate by sound long

312
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:53,319
distances the whales the elephant they

313
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,439
use infrasound that very low SP Spectrum

314
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,160
think about somebody with a young uh

315
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,279
driver pulling up with a Bas on their

316
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:01,919
vehicle next to you boom boom that

317
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,600
really carries ultrasound is the exact

318
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,399
opposite your tires on your car probably

319
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,560
produce more ultrasonic noise than these

320
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,839
things do and so again that's just a

321
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,919
waste of

322
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,920
time while I talk a little bit about

323
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,000
ticks anybody that's working outdoors in

324
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,958
the plant industry needs to be aware of

325
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,958
ticks and tick poring diseases because

326
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,759
they're on the increase uh the two

327
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:24,679
dominant species we really got to worry

328
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:27,159
about are blacklegged or deer ticks you

329
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,679
can see how small the adults drives spe

330
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:32,639
most all of you heard about line disease

331
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,719
and can recognize blacklegged tick the

332
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,639
other one on Long Island in Southeastern

333
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,519
New York that's getting to be a equal

334
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,079
importance if not more so is the lone

335
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,240
star tick uh name for the white spot on

336
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:47,039
the back of the female uh Lone Star

337
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,360
transmit liosis which has Sy very

338
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,439
similar symptoms to Lyme disease one of

339
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,839
my field staff that was working with Dan

340
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,240
Gil down on Long Island years ago uh had

341
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,240
several Ticks by thought she had

342
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,839
contracted lime disease went to the her

343
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,480
doctor and got tested twice and all the

344
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,959
lime test kept coming back negative so

345
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,120
he finally said well test for this whole

346
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,119
panel there's four major tick related

347
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,879
disease and sure enough she had a liosis

348
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,120
was treated for that and recovered fine

349
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,879
but again there there's more than one

350
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,759
disease that you got to be aware of so

351
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:22,559
again the lone star tick uh uh is the

352
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,879
primary Vector for liosis blacklegged

353
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,719
tick anaplasmosis is really on the

354
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,240
increase in different parts of the of

355
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,320
New York State you got to start watching

356
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,560
for that one

357
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,959
Lime You're all aware of bosis I haven't

358
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,799
seen much recent data on that but

359
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,439
there's more than one tick born disease

360
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:41,278
out there and if you've been bitten by

361
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,120
tick you know it you're not feeling well

362
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,799
see a physician as soon as possible and

363
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,278
see if you can sort it out because

364
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,719
usually it's those top uh four diseases

365
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,320
the ones that they screen for when they

366
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,040
do the in complete IG IGG

367
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,680
panels so what can we do how can we

368
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,240
manage tickborne disease is such line a

369
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,239
lot of communities are trying to reduce

370
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,198
deer numbers and I put question marks at

371
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,000
that because the data are not

372
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,000
encouraging on reducing deer number uh

373
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,879
past Island studies and past research

374
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,240
has shown for blacklegged tick

375
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,720
populations to crash you've got to get

376
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,680
deer densities below about six to eight

377
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,839
deer per square mile then there's not

378
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,638
enough deer in the landscape uh to

379
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,680
perpetuate and keep the the uh Lyme

380
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:26,680
disease and tick spreading so what would

381
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:29,039
folks guess average deer densities

382
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:31,159
around here if I went over to West Hill

383
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,039
just on the other side of town what

384
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,559
would you guess deer denses might be on

385
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,480
West

386
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:41,039
Hill anybody got a number you can throw

387
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:43,920
out what's that 20 to 30 20 to 30 per

388
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:46,360
square mile that's about 100

389
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,240
short everywhere I've measured around

390
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,959
here with infrared triggered cameras I

391
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,639
pretty consistently come up with about

392
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:55,159
120 to 125 deer per square mile that's

393
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,440
what was in village of cuga heights

394
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,000
before we started a program we had close

395
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,240
not quite that high on Camp campus we

396
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,198
had about just under 100 deer per square

397
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,440
mile Northeast area where we've done

398
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,919
camera surveys we've come up with 125

399
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,079
deer per square mile that's pretty

400
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,120
typical Suburban densities particularly

401
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,039
in non- hunted areas so what's your

402
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,799
chances of getting down to six deer per

403
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:18,879
square mile you got 100 plus on the

404
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:21,519
landscape it's almost near zero so

405
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,439
that's why I question it will it help

406
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,799
and pro probably n so I don't want to

407
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,800
sell something that I don't think is

408
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,439
going to work

409
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,679
realistically population

410
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,519
is oh Eastern Long Island is worse than

411
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,719
around here when I was doing work out on

412
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,919
Shelter Island we were estimating

413
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,199
density of 250 per square mile on

414
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,759
Shelter Island Eastern Long Island just

415
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,479
incredibly High deer densities marks

416
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,079
well aware of that probably will'll talk

417
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,480
about it so when you've got high deer

418
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,359
densities you want to protect plant

419
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,360
materials fencing to exclude uh or

420
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,399
protect areas fencing is the best thing

421
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,120
so what I recommend the communities of

422
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,078
tickborne disease or problem fence

423
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,879
children's playgrounds fence small

424
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,879
public areas where there's High chance

425
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:03,318
for interaction of particularly children

426
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,958
and where you don't want deer on the

427
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:07,838
landscape self- application of a carides

428
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:10,078
like peran with a floor poster devices

429
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,079
we tested those on Long Island over a

430
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,919
three-year period again working with Dan

431
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,159
Gil down there we saw about 95%

432
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:19,159
reduction in in uh tick numbers on Long

433
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:21,198
Island with a four posters but in New

434
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,759
York state they're only registered for

435
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,000
use on Long Island right now they can't

436
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,720
use them anywhere else and the issue is

437
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,799
potentially baiting deer and uh um

438
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,839
potentially increasing population so

439
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:37,039
unless something changes with Bureau DC

440
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,040
Bureau Wildlife uh that's a very limited

441
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:44,318
tool that four poster device is that

442
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:47,119
picture on the right it's a big corn

443
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:49,078
Hopper it's got 200 lb of corn in it and

444
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,360
it's got these sort of paint rollers on

445
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,799
Springs two on each end and a feeding

446
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,278
trout and a certified pesticide

447
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:58,479
applicator comes in weekly measures the

448
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:00,039
amount of corn consumed in the device

449
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,000
can estimate number of deer visiting and

450
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:03,879
then knows how much spray perome and

451
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,359
spray to put on the roller so when the

452
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:09,000
deer reaches its head into the device it

453
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,000
self-medicating just like prome in a dog

454
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,359
collar or something and it really does

455
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,439
if you can get the right density of

456
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,759
devices out it really does cut back on

457
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,480
tick loads and number of uh ticks that

458
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:22,199
deer are carrying so it reduces

459
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,120
theer yeah that's absolutely right and

460
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,600
so again and that's part of the concern

461
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,599
DEC has you're not doing addressing any

462
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,399
of the other issues you're only

463
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,399
addressing the ticks

464
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,119
you can do some Landscaping type of

465
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,558
things uh for blacklegged ticks and

466
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,918
again this doesn't work as well for lone

467
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:42,119
star ticks lone stars are more of a warm

468
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,240
seasoned tick they like more warm grassy

469
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:46,879
areas but blacklegged ticks are more of

470
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,640
a cool season tick they like shaded cool

471
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,240
moist area so you can uh try to put wood

472
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,000
chip pads for example around your yard

473
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,679
and then keep the yard well mowed and

474
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,759
clean and not having any debris so that

475
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,000
uh you can try again create a barrier

476
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,720
between the tick habitat and the yard

477
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,798
that doesn't mean a deer can't wander

478
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,240
across your yard and not drop a tick but

479
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:09,839
the ticks themselves won't migrate very

480
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,240
large distance because they desiccate

481
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:16,558
easily in full sun or across very dry

482
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,880
areas talk a little bit about landscape

483
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,720
plant damage uh back in the mid 90s

484
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,440
there was a national survey done by Mike

485
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,960
Conor and he estimated there were about

486
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,919
$250 million in damage the plant

487
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,120
industry back then and I think that's a

488
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,919
huge underestimate uh we did a survey in

489
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,439
Westchester County alone back in the

490
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,400
late uh 1980s and found there were six

491
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,200
and a half to9 a. half million dollar in

492
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,240
plant losses in one County in New York

493
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,840
state so I think the way that National

494
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,400
survey was designed they just missed a

495
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,798
whole lot of damage back then plant

496
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,440
replacement cost average about $500 per

497
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,079
home with dear damage but the really

498
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,400
important thing is we learned that

499
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,798
things that are evergreen Woody

500
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,000
ornamentals that are evergreen used Rod

501
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:57,879
dendon Arbor V are the plants that are

502
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,480
most frequently damaged by deer during

503
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,520
the winter months and they select them

504
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,679
out in the

505
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:06,558
landscape so what can we do reducing

506
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,480
damage uh repellants work best when the

507
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,879
deer pressure and damage is light uh

508
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,960
shortterm and most areas in New York

509
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,880
state now are beyond that to be honest

510
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,679
fencing provides the only reliable

511
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,559
protection when the deer damage gets

512
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,440
monitored to heavy again trying to

513
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,918
manage deer densities and keep numbers

514
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,000
down we know each adult deer eats 6 to 8

515
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,640
pounds of forage today when they're your

516
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,119
precious plant materials that's a lot of

517
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,559
plant material that they can go through

518
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,038
you can choose plants that are less

519
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,639
attractive I'll mention a few things

520
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:37,720
Mark's going to follow up and talk much

521
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,520
more about that and I want to emphasize

522
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,360
deer feeding is illegal in New York

523
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,440
state some people still like to feed

524
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,798
deer and if you're feeding particularly

525
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,480
within 300 feet of a public Highway you

526
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:49,798
will likely get a citation from the

527
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,798
Environmental Conservation

528
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:56,158
officer all sorts of fencing uh barrier

529
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:58,400
uh gardening you can put up an 8T High

530
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,799
woven wire uh fence stats pretty pretty

531
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,720
much the Cadillac uh but yeah it's

532
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,279
completely deer proof in the last 25

533
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,880
years so you put your cost up on front

534
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,798
then not worry about it for a while uh

535
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,280
the lower right homeowners design all

536
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:14,599
sorts of types of fences that one has a

537
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,639
4ot high wire barrier on the bottom and

538
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:18,719
single strands of wire with flagging up

539
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,640
above that the upper right is the

540
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,240
Cornell Arbor where they cage individual

541
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,200
trees and shrubs they want to protect

542
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,839
and plastic netting on on wooden St Stak

543
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,360
so there's all different ways to protect

544
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:30,720
plant materials from Deer it's just

545
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:34,199
again what fits your budget and your

546
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,558
cost and how much area do you need to

547
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,600
protect we know from past research that

548
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:43,918
uh several commercially available deer

549
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:46,839
repellants do provide some uh success uh

550
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,120
big game uh repellent or dear way and

551
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:51,199
repeated trials we've done has been our

552
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,439
our our best option so far the active

553
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,440
ingredient is pess and egg solids deer

554
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,120
hate the smell of pess and eggs hinder

555
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,159
is relatively decent it's a soap based

556
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:02,798
based product very wide labeling you can

557
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,120
use it on food crops too deer off did

558
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:10,158
fairly well it's a combination of uh um

559
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:12,278
the pess egg solids and caps uh the Bony

560
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,520
rabbit deer pellet used to be thyrm it

561
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:16,558
got sold that label got sold now it's

562
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:20,400
essentially the same ingredients as deer

563
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:22,158
off hot sauce is caps you know what that

564
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,080
hot peppers tastes like very high

565
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,600
concentration of that very good deer and

566
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,319
Elk repellent uh tree guard is a

567
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:31,240
bittering agent Den antonium benzo deer

568
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:32,798
pay almost no attention to bittering

569
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,558
agents don't waste your time and money

570
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,278
on those plants are full of bitter

571
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,158
compounds that deer have used learned

572
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:41,759
how to detoxify and spot tref is a

573
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,880
fungicide that's registered as a deer

574
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,960
repellent and thym is the active

575
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,120
ingredient High concentration of firearm

576
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,798
is a pretty decent deer pent though not

577
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:53,479
as good as the rotten eggs we've done

578
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,000
lots of Trials over the years I like to

579
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,079
test deer repellant when the deer are

580
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,079
the hungriest January February March

581
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:02,119
we've got free4 four or 5 Ines of snow

582
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:04,359
on the ground I'll get uh Horticultural

583
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:06,759
plants this with Japanese used bald and

584
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:08,119
burlap treat them indoors under good

585
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,480
conditions with different repellant and

586
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,519
take them out and place them in the

587
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,519
landscape when there's snow cover on the

588
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,359
ground and see what happens when deer

589
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,599
really hungry that gives you a really

590
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,479
good test of how while a repellent works

591
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:23,038
and this is one of our control use after

592
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,079
two weeks in the field you can see about

593
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,158
half the plant surface area is gone deer

594
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,199
tracks everywhere that's very typical

595
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:32,200
again you use one the the winter candy

596
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,600
for deer around here they love

597
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,278
it one of our uh repellent trial you can

598
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:41,359
see we tested the big game repellent

599
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:44,839
with mix and spray both different types

600
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:47,000
here uh also deer off was pesent egg

601
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:50,240
solids and deer stopper had pesent egg

602
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,119
solids these are the top four we saw no

603
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,759
damage during the first four weeks of

604
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,798
the experiment in with these plants in

605
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,038
the field and then you you can see what

606
00:22:55,798 --> 00:23:00,319
happens they go downhill pretty quickly

607
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:02,759
so the take-home message was repellants

608
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,678
a decent deer repellent with pesent egg

609
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,079
solids or a really high concentration of

610
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,120
caps of thym will give you about four to

611
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,599
five weeks of decent protection but then

612
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,839
it loses efficacy at weathers and if

613
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,158
you're around here in the middle of

614
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:16,278
winter you're not going to be doing any

615
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,080
spraying in January February March so I

616
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:19,480
after if you've sprayed late November

617
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,038
say you had a good day you could get

618
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,200
some spray on by the end of December

619
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:26,720
beginning January that material is gone

620
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,120
and your plants are Su susceptible so

621
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,600
sprays have their place they tend not to

622
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:36,158
work for over winter

623
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:38,240
protection for simple uh homeowner

624
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,919
application we've uh toyed some with

625
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,679
these rope fences and they can be very

626
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,200
effective for small areas white cotton

627
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,919
cord on green Stakes probably can't see

628
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,919
it but there's green cotton claw

629
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,840
suspended here in the center and we

630
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,360
treated those claw strips with a big

631
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:55,038
game repellant the odor based deer

632
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:58,439
repellent and there uh flower head

633
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,679
density on that uh control B ground in

634
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,640
the foreground was the same as the

635
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,360
planting bed in the background during

636
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,320
summer very simple fences will keep deer

637
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,959
out of small kitchen Garden area small

638
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,000
planting areas you don't have to get

639
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,440
something elaborate and expensive

640
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,519
because deer have lots of green stuff to

641
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,080
eat in the summer that'll fail miserably

642
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,639
other times of the

643
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:20,079
year we've learned a lot about deer

644
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,400
behavior in Suburbia in the last 20

645
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,319
years of research and there's a lot of

646
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,759
things that influence deer fing pressure

647
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,839
and whether it's Mark's licks whether

648
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,079
it's my list I get calls all the time

649
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:33,119
well so and so plants on your deer

650
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,639
resistant and they eat it in my yard but

651
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,879
my neighbor are two houses away they

652
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,840
don't touch it why well it's all these

653
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,159
different things they related to Deer

654
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:43,558
Behavior population density how many

655
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,919
miles do you have to feed food and cover

656
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:48,720
sources and travel quarter if you've got

657
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,840
a plant that's relatively deer resistant

658
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,038
most of the time that will work fine and

659
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,398
you don't need to protect it but if your

660
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,240
home happens to live on a travel quarter

661
00:24:55,398 --> 00:24:59,519
where deer there every day and every

662
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,159
night guess what even those resistant

663
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,440
plants start to get eaten and the list

664
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:05,960
don't work all that well alternative

665
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,640
Foods plants that deer won't take during

666
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,519
spring summer and fall you get a little

667
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,240
snow on the ground tough winter they'll

668
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,359
Hammer them in the winter months when

669
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,679
they don't have alternative foods and

670
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:18,759
the and the season isn't good deer

671
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,440
nutrition is important uh what are their

672
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:22,759
fat reserves like has it been a really

673
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,120
tough winter I've seen deer eat vinka to

674
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:26,640
the ground uh eat pack of sander which

675
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,319
they don't usually eat at the end of a

676
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,720
tough winter when they're at starvation

677
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,918
mode and they're just trying to put

678
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,038
something in their room and they get

679
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,880
through to Green up plant pal

680
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:38,359
palatability and nutrients are important

681
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,799
deer consents nitrogen in plant material

682
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:43,038
what do we do we we fertilize our plants

683
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,839
deer know that they're craving nitrogen

684
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:47,119
and they pick the high nitrogen plants

685
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,918
in natural habitats and they'll go and

686
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,278
pick the highly fertilized plants in the

687
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:53,640
home landscape in previous experience I

688
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,640
learned the hard way uh Bill Miller and

689
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,038
I did a trial years ago with some

690
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,278
ornamental and Asiatic Liles trying to

691
00:25:58,038 --> 00:26:03,558
look at deer resistance of variety and

692
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:05,880
we put containerized lilies out in in 10

693
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:07,678
different homeowner sites in seven of

694
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,200
the 10 sites that the lilies were

695
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,679
hammered nothing survived but yet in

696
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,759
three of the sites deer were in the

697
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,320
landscape we got them on camera and the

698
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:17,839
lies weren't touched and I we're sitting

699
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,200
there scratching our head what's going

700
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,918
on there's obviously no deer resistance

701
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,360
to these lies they got hammered 7 out of

702
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,520
10 sites and what we realized is in

703
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:28,479
those specific homeowner sites where we

704
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,720
had those there were no other lilies in

705
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,519
the neighborhood deer hadn't recognized

706
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,919
them as food yet and so again that adult

707
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,720
dough will teach her Offspring what's

708
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,200
palatable and what's not once they

709
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,200
sample them they don't have any

710
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,038
protection anymore because they know

711
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,240
it's something good to eat so again all

712
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:45,480
these Behavior things make it really

713
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,519
difficult to predict sometimes what

714
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,880
plants will and won't be taken in the

715
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,119
landscape these are what I consider uh

716
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,840
Woody ornamentals that are starvation

717
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,519
foods for years sort of the last thing

718
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:59,599
on the list that they'll take if they're

719
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:02,158
eating C Colorado Blue Spruce there's

720
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,038
not much else out there same thing with

721
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,720
uh boxwood that we talked about earlier

722
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:09,720
that's a starvation food for Deer uh

723
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,880
you'll notice this list is very short

724
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,440
deer will eat just about anything uh but

725
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,480
you know with some careful plant

726
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,159
selection you can design a more deer

727
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,000
resistant landscape where you can

728
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,278
probably avoid spraying you can probably

729
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,640
avoid the cost of fencing on the other

730
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,839
end of the spectrum these are plant

731
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,600
materials that are frequently severely d

732
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,558
these are things deer seek out Woody

733
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,199
ornamentals in the landscape you got

734
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:35,879
your Balsam and fras your Furs on there

735
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,759
uh your fruit trees things like you want

736
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,679
them as they love uh things with big

737
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:44,519
tasty buds like R dend and aelas your

738
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,880
ashes use Arbor V if you've got these

739
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,919
type of plant materials and they're many

740
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,399
deer around at all they're probably

741
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,399
going to require protection during the

742
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,398
winter months or you're likely to suffer

743
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:00,000
damage uh Bill Miller and I did AUD

744
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,319
study with perennial bulbs uh decade or

745
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,319
so ago looking at deer resistance of a

746
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,119
variety of different bulbs and we just

747
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,879
put them out cafeteria style and the

748
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:12,639
homeowner yard and uh we had again about

749
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,519
two dozen different uh cafeteras set up

750
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,960
in in a home landscape in a community

751
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:17,880
where there were around 100 deer per

752
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,399
square mile we wanted to see well what's

753
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,679
what's typical what survives at 100 deer

754
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,158
per square mile and these are the bulbs

755
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,840
we're all grown in the greenhouse here

756
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,039
on campus uh again you can read down the

757
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:31,319
list I'm not going to repeat all of them

758
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,919
uh but our control were tulips we know

759
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:35,439
deer love tulips and you tried to grow

760
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,880
tulips in Deer Country you're probably

761
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,798
going to need to protect them in some

762
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,600
way and so we just went out during the

763
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:43,960
Spring and Then followed each of these

764
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,798
plants and looked at Survivor ship and

765
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,679
sure enough deer would come along and

766
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:49,639
pull the pots out of the trays eat what

767
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,759
they liked ignore what they didn't like

768
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,399
and so we could get a really good

769
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:56,640
measure of what was deer resistance in

770
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:59,879
terms of uh perennial bulbs and no big

771
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,960
surprise the our mean damage score was

772
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,200
highest for tulips crocuses were highly

773
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,880
favored and then they like kod doxis and

774
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,919
most of the rest of the stuff was pretty

775
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,000
darn deer resistant they rarely take a

776
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:17,240
narcissist or a highin rarely take Iris

777
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,919
or alium or things like that and so most

778
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:23,079
of your spring bulbs or if you can avoid

779
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,440
the Tulips and crocuses are pretty safe

780
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:26,599
uh but if you're grow have to have

781
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,798
tulips and crocuses uh better be

782
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:31,199
considering some type of deer

783
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:34,038
protection we also did cage feeding

784
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,720
trials with Vols we had a v CL on campus

785
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:39,839
years ago and we gave bold weade bold

786
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,440
material to pairs of Vols and cages to

787
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,000
see if the plants that were deer

788
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,440
resistant were also V resistant and sure

789
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,440
enough almost everything that the deer

790
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,120
would e the Vols didn't e either so

791
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,360
these plants have some types of

792
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:55,439
secondary compound that give them

793
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:56,879
herbivore resistance or protection uh

794
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,840
the one thing that would really neat I

795
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,399
guess we found found out is this uh

796
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,158
actually killed the Vols in the trial we

797
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:04,518
had to stop feeding it I mean it was

798
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:06,440
toxic that was the only plan on that

799
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:09,079
list that was toxic but BS just couldn't

800
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,080
even eat the

801
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,599
stuff conifers uh we've done surveys

802
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,120
with tree Growers and again no big

803
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:20,678
surprise here if you're growing Furs uh

804
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,599
those are the most susceptible to your

805
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,720
damage and at the opposite end of the

806
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:27,000
spectrum are your uh spruces

807
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,960
particularly Blue Spruce and your pinees

808
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,480
white Pine of the Pine's the most

809
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,200
susceptible uh but there's a red pine

810
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,960
and Austrian pine aren't that all that

811
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,480
susceptible so most of the conifers you

812
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,200
can get away

813
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,159
with rubbing damage is not feeding

814
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,840
damage and it doesn't matter how

815
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,960
resistant your plants are when the Bucks

816
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:46,720
are going to rub trees they're going to

817
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,360
rub trees and uh so again the only way

818
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,600
to stop this damage is to fence deer out

819
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:54,240
of the planting completely or get a DEC

820
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:56,599
damage permitted you got safe shooting

821
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,440
zones and remove that problem Buck

822
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,158
that's causing solve your problem but a

823
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,600
buck might go in on territory bound and

824
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,440
you and rub 50 or 100 trees in one night

825
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:09,158
that can be a a huge economic loss for a

826
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,639
grower want to just briefly wrap up and

827
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:12,600
talk about some of the research that

828
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:15,199
we've been doing on and around campus

829
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:16,959
for the last decade uh looking at again

830
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,000
trying to understand deer behavior and

831
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,798
particularly population ecology

832
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,038
population biology so what we decide to

833
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:26,079
do most communities that want to control

834
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:28,119
deer you either you got all the sort of

835
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,439
the animal welfare fol and we can't kill

836
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:33,359
any deer no blood on the snow we want to

837
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,880
go contraceptives and so okay well

838
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,398
that's expensive and you can only do it

839
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,559
with a research permit or they get the

840
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:41,158
other group that wants to shoot them all

841
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:43,079
and do everything they can to remove

842
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,360
them and they say well why are these two

843
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:47,359
groups opposed each other we' got the

844
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,839
same goal we want to reduce deer number

845
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,918
so here in core campus right where we're

846
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:55,199
sitting we can't carry firearms or bows

847
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,399
I mean you know that's a real problem

848
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,720
yeah we had a ton of deer here a few

849
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:01,719
years ago and yet all those red lands

850
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,839
are Cornell owned properly mostly the

851
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,000
south north and east of here that are

852
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,678
huntable and have been hunted for decad

853
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,798
so he said well why do one or there

854
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,240
let's do both and see if we can get some

855
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:14,119
G Synergy out of using both methods so

856
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,000
we did a sterilization try on core

857
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:17,879
campus so we could hunt then did a

858
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,960
controlled hunting program on the lands

859
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,000
adjacent to Camp as best as we

860
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:26,038
could so we captured Mark deer and trap

861
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,159
ear tagged all the deer F captured uh

862
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:31,960
put radio collar up a bunch of the adult

863
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:34,240
females and then looked at uh their

864
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,038
behavior and movements we took all the

865
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,480
female deer to the College of veterinary

866
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,000
medicine we had a lot of willing

867
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,558
students who needed some experience and

868
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,960
uh essentially spay them just like it

869
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:46,038
would your dog or your cat and then took

870
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,679
them back out put them on campus under

871
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:49,919
our research permit just to look at

872
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,240
survivorship movements over time but we

873
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,919
wanted to cut off on production and we

874
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,359
did pretty good at the peak of our

875
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,200
sterilization project we had 95% % of

876
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:01,918
the deer on campus sterilized the female

877
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,240
deer and so that would really cut our

878
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,679
fond numbers down to about nothing and

879
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,720
we had some control do 26 Mark control

880
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:11,960
do on lands north and south of Campus

881
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,759
that we compare against and so when we

882
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,240
looked at movements of mortality factors

883
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:17,200
if you're an urban deer you essentially

884
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,638
die a one or two ways either run in

885
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,038
front of a motor vehicle no big surprise

886
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:23,199
or you get into a huntable area and

887
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:25,278
somebody shoots you and just like every

888
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,480
other study our study was no different

889
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:28,798
most of our T callor deer Di one of

890
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,839
those two

891
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,599
ways we also did population estimation

892
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,119
with infrared triggered cameras over

893
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,000
bait deer come in take their own

894
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,079
pictures and because we've got them all

895
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,278
tagged or high proportion tagged we can

896
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:43,079
do Mark recapture simulation and

897
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:44,880
modeling and actually get very reliable

898
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:47,278
estimates of abundance in the

899
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,399
sterilization Zone we did a controlled

900
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:50,880
hunting program it actually continues

901
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:53,599
but these are the first few years of

902
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,760
data J bander worked closely with me on

903
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:59,839
this and uh we took a p of deer off

904
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:02,000
those red zones over the seven year

905
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:05,480
first seven years of the program we

906
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,159
removed over 700 deer from those areas

907
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:12,000
so we took 700 deer off campus lands we

908
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,919
sterilized 95% of our dos what do you

909
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,679
think

910
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:17,319
happened nothing nothing you're

911
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,519
absolutely right

912
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,320
nothing I'll show you the data in a

913
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:23,960
moment what we had to do to really get

914
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,119
aggressive uh but our our hunting

915
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,398
program has been very popular we provide

916
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,440
a lot of recreation but hunting alone

917
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:33,838
has not achieved our management goal

918
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,079
even though we've taken over 700 deer

919
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:39,440
through legal hunting

920
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,919
means uh Dr Baron blossi uh has Sentinel

921
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,599
Oak seedling project on campus puts out

922
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,398
paired Northern Red Oaks that are raised

923
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,720
in green houses 20 caged 20 uncaged and

924
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:50,598
tagged in ploth and look at survivors as

925
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,398
an indicator species we know deer like

926
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,320
the Oaks uh to biodiversity and deer

927
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,598
impact that's one of the way we measure

928
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,280
of our programs having any success

929
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,359
so we here's a one of the plots at the

930
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,680
Cornell golf course not far from very 5

931
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:05,960
minute walk from where you're going on

932
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:07,879
Bluegrass Lane this afternoon you can

933
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,920
see what our Oak survivorship is it's

934
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,200
dismal we can't we haven't grown Oaks

935
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,000
and Maples on this campus in 20 years

936
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:15,559
there just too many deer in the woods

937
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,320
and so again we're trying to get some

938
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:20,599
way to impact this and turn this around

939
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,760
so we can sustain our natural areas on

940
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:24,838
campus so we finally decided we're going

941
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,560
to get real grassy hunting's not working

942
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:29,039
sterilization not working not working

943
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,320
comp fine so let's apply to DEC for a

944
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,199
damage permit and we did the damage

945
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,960
permit provides access to deer in

946
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:37,679
non-hunting areas we can get closer in

947
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,159
the campus and building we hand screen

948
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,679
and select Shooters and they have to

949
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:45,239
Prof pass a proficiency test being able

950
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:47,279
to take deer at night with a bow that

951
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:48,799
takes a little bit of practice not your

952
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,319
average hun these are the best of the

953
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,800
best analist deer only our permit allows

954
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:56,480
us to use bait at night we can use

955
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,440
lights artificial Lighting on our bows

956
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,838
to 11:00 p.m. at night we campus police

957
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:06,480
approved use of crossbows and vertical

958
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:08,039
compound bows on on campus um each of

959
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,079
those had different discharge distances

960
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,519
under New York State regs we have to

961
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,079
follow all the discharge distances 250

962
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:17,838
ft from buildings for crossbows 150 ft

963
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:20,318
for vertical bows our limit of deer is

964
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,920
based on the number of DC tags issued in

965
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:24,920
they each year they've issued us 40 for

966
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,720
the first couple years we took 34 deer

967
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,318
on those 40 permits mostly after dark I

968
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:32,199
think only one was during normal hunting

969
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:36,639
hours and then uh in the following year

970
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:39,838
2014 50 uh 15 we took 37 on our 40 tag

971
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:42,480
at night then here are the population

972
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:44,159
data I mentioned here's all our hunting

973
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,079
and sterilization program you see what

974
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,719
deer are doing here's the first two

975
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,440
years of the damage permit cut the herd

976
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:54,078
in half the problem is you got to go to

977
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,440
where the deer are and you got to have

978
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,440
the most skilled people doing the job

979
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,358
right

980
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,400
uh we don't want crippling loss uh most

981
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:03,598
those deer are very smart the reason

982
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,079
Hunters don't take them they go

983
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,960
nocturnal they know when it's safe and

984
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,000
we can go out there at night with lights

985
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,199
and special equipment on on bows and

986
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,800
take those deer when they feel safe and

987
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:15,559
we can get in the areas that Hunters

988
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,519
can't access and that's what caused that

989
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:20,039
difference over the two

990
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:22,559
years lots of urban deer management

991
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:25,239
challenges again most these programs are

992
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:27,159
very expensive gota be concerned with

993
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:28,959
Public Safety imagine

994
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,199
having firearms and the bows around a

995
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,318
campus like this we work very closely

996
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:37,159
with Cornell police public values are

997
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:41,239
one uh when we did some uh capture and

998
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:44,279
euthanization under our DEC permit of uh

999
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:46,358
anal our groups went went berserk our

1000
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,440
University president got 10,000 emails

1001
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:50,880
in one day trying to shut our program

1002
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,599
down and so again you've got to work

1003
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,680
with communication and we had our

1004
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:56,359
communication plan all set up in case

1005
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:58,879
that occurred and we weathered the storm

1006
00:37:56,358 --> 00:38:00,400
our program continues got to have access

1007
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,760
to Deer I don't care what you're doing

1008
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,960
if you can't get to the deer where

1009
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,280
they're at you're going to do no good so

1010
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,920
that means working with private land

1011
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,200
owners working with public land owners

1012
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,280
working again with police to get the

1013
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:13,960
access to the points that you need got

1014
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,839
to follow all state laws and regulations

1015
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,679
discharge distances are important

1016
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,279
setting reasonable goals was important

1017
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,440
too uh what we found our goal when we

1018
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,040
started this project thinking that by

1019
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,159
hunting and sterilization we were going

1020
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:28,920
to reduce deer abundance by 75% in five

1021
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:31,598
years that was our goal we didn't even

1022
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,639
touch it we never even got close and so

1023
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,079
it's just how resilient these animals

1024
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:38,000
are until you work with them you don't

1025
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,480
understand that sometimes and you got to

1026
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
be working very closely with police

1027
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,679
agencies you want more details we put an

1028
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,760
extension booklet together free PDFs

1029
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:50,759
available online you can go to the

1030
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,960
wildlife control.in info website uh

1031
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,359
there's a number of uh fact sheets and

1032
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,960
PDF format for a variety of uh Urban

1033
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:00,199
Wildlife species are dear reports there

1034
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,159
uh uh info on ongoing research so I

1035
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:04,000
thought I'd save a little paper and uh

1036
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:07,318
folks can go to the website and uh

1037
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,599
download uh whatever you want in in PDF

1038
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:12,000
format with that probably running a

1039
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:14,559
little bit behind me maybe there's one

1040
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,719
or two real quick question do you think

1041
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:19,078
that um pairing this with a feed the

1042
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,919
hungry program and making a big issue

1043
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,480
out of turning the Mee into food uh for

1044
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,639
people would would change some

1045
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,838
perception from the public uh the

1046
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:29,519
question was uh incorporating the the

1047
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:31,639
Venice and donation Coalition feeding

1048
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,440
the hungry does that change perception

1049
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:36,199
absolutely in fact we've got a program

1050
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,000
going on Village of cuga heights just

1051
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:41,759
north of Campus we started there four

1052
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,079
years ago at 125 deer per square mile

1053
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,599
and now we're down to 37 deer per square

1054
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,560
mile on a damage per minut every one of

1055
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,640
those deer went to the benis and

1056
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,799
donation Coalition and and go to the

1057
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:56,039
food uh Food Bank of the central tier so

1058
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,519
yeah that made a huge difference for a

1059
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:59,559
lot of people and gives us public

1060
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,358
support not everybody buys into it

1061
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:03,880
you're still going to get resistance

1062
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:07,519
from really strong animal Ware Advocates

1063
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:10,200
but for the general public yes hugely

1064
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:12,920
important so I'm assuming this has

1065
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:16,879
always been a problem so what

1066
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,920
happened 20 30 years ago okay what

1067
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,960
happened 23 years ago there's several

1068
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,599
things that have happened uh one is that

1069
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,720
deer population really started to grow

1070
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,359
exponentially and I think what happen

1071
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,679
particular in these Suburban areas that

1072
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:33,159
aren't hunted heavily or even hunted at

1073
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:35,598
all is we got to that critical threshold

1074
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:38,838
density that allows the population to go

1075
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,280
exponential and we hit that and what we

1076
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:43,480
used to have in the 60s and 70s was

1077
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,240
every 3 four years we get a tough winter

1078
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,719
what controls deer abundance in the

1079
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:48,679
natural landscape in New York and

1080
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,759
Northern Pennsylvania is winter severity

1081
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,399
and snow depth winter snow depth that's

1082
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,599
one of the reasons that deer densities

1083
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,440
are lowest in the Adera anywhere in the

1084
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,599
state because the Deep persist snow that

1085
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,280
they get up there average deer densities

1086
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:04,280
in the Adera are 6 to 10 per square mile

1087
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,119
not 100 per square mile and as that long

1088
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,519
snow duration some deer just don't

1089
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:09,280
survive the winter their fat reserves

1090
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,838
won't carry them through but with

1091
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,760
climate change we've had decades couple

1092
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:16,599
decades now relatively mild winner the

1093
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,280
last winner that was severe enough here

1094
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:22,079
in Ithaca to set deer population back

1095
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,839
was the winner of 2002 2003 we haven't

1096
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,440
had a winter bad enough to impact the

1097
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:27,838
deer her since then and the problem is

1098
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,039
that when you do get a winter and bad

1099
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,719
and the deer numbers drop that's when

1100
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:34,838
the hunters are out uh complaining that

1101
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,358
deer numbers are down cut the do tags we

1102
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:38,000
got to build the population back up

1103
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:39,920
that's the time you need to increase the

1104
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,838
dough tags and just keep it at them and

1105
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,680
you can actually do some good but

1106
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:45,920
there's public resistance to it and then

1107
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:48,078
what about predators

1108
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,960
predators really there's Predators on

1109
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,960
the landscape very rarely to Predators

1110
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,960
control prey abundance it's uses the

1111
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,039
exact opposite that's pretty true in

1112
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,920
most places with deer there are a few

1113
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:02,440
places in the in for example the at

1114
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,280
Ronda where you get deep snow where

1115
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,639
coyotes for example can have advantage

1116
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,040
and take a fair number of deer and

1117
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:10,679
locally suppress a herd we don't get

1118
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:13,400
that situation usually in Southern New

1119
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:15,759
York and in Most states uh so yeah we've

1120
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,680
got healthy coyote populations and they

1121
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,720
we got healthy Bobcat populations in

1122
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,399
they're expanding and yet we've got

1123
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:23,558
healthy deer population so as long as

1124
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,519
there's plenty of prey the Predators do

1125
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:28,280
well but they don't really control the

1126
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:32,599
herd they all just don't take

1127
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,599
enough okay thank you much thank you
