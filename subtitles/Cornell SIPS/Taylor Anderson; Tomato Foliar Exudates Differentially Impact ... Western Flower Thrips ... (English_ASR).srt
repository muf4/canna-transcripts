1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,320
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,320
University

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,679
so next year I'm gonna be talking a

4
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:13,179
little bit more about my efforts to

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,218
breed for disease resistance in

6
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,539
Northeast adapted tomato but today I'm

7
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:18,009
going to be talking about something a

8
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:20,500
little bit different I'm going to be

9
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,600
talking about an experiment that I did

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,579
to evaluate some of our insect resistant

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,520
tomato lines against this guy right here

12
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:29,669
the Western flower trim so the Western

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,989
flower thrip causes damage to tomato

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,179
both directly and indirectly and

15
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:36,969
directly it's done by sucking out cell

16
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:40,479
contents and by inserting eggs into the

17
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:43,120
epidermis of the leaf and stem tissue

18
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,429
and that's called ova position it also

19
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,949
causes indirect damage by transmitting

20
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:50,769
viruses such as the tomato spotted wilt

21
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:53,920
virus seen there and traditionally that

22
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:56,020
system is managed by insecticides but

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,450
there could be an alternative so a so

24
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,399
sugars are foliar secondary metabolites

25
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,739
they're insect resistant metabolites and

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,890
they're accumulated in particularly high

27
00:01:02,738 --> 00:01:07,899
quantities by wild species in Solanaceae

28
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,649
so here we see some type four trichomes

29
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:13,718
with droplets full of acyl sugars and

30
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:16,179
the acyl sugar phenotype of a plant is

31
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:18,818
defined by two primary parameters so the

32
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:20,049
first one is the aggregate amount of all

33
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:22,899
of the different types of basil sugar

34
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:24,850
and the second is the chemo type or the

35
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:26,618
different structures or chemical

36
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:30,908
components that make up the a so sugars

37
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:32,319
and the kibo type can be quite diverse

38
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:33,850
in tomato

39
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,709
there could be a monosaccharide or a

40
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:37,718
disaccharide sugar base there can be

41
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:39,520
three to four attached fatty acids and

42
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:41,259
those fatty acids can be attached in

43
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,608
different spatial orientations they

44
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:45,159
could be of different lights and they

45
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:47,438
can be branched differently luckily for

46
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,779
me Martha and John had recently created

47
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,879
a number of inbred tomato lines that

48
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:53,709
varied both the amount and chemo type in

49
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,888
tomato which allowed me to test a few

50
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:59,319
hypotheses so I wanted to know do fully

51
00:01:56,888 --> 00:02:01,658
Reysol sugars impact thrips over

52
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:04,239
position rates and tosco virus

53
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:06,489
inoculation rates if so is there

54
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,679
variation for that insect resistance

55
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:11,319
phenotype just as there's variation for

56
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,539
the acyl Sugar plant phenotype and can

57
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:16,389
some of that variation be attributed to

58
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:18,519
either the amount of a so sugar or the

59
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:20,889
chemo type of the a so sugars or some

60
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,570
combination of both

61
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:25,269
so to do that I did an insect choice

62
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:27,879
assay so a Western flower thrip was

63
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,620
exposed to to leaf disks and these leaf

64
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,780
disks were from the same leaf from the

65
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,909
same plant treated identically in every

66
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,890
way except that one was washed with

67
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:40,210
water and that temporarily removes the

68
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:42,159
foliar exudates by about 75% allowing me

69
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,260
to test presence/absence of a slow

70
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,329
sugars in a separate dimension looking

71
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:48,459
at differences among genotypes we have

72
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,230
celebrity and m82 which were included in

73
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,330
the experiment these are commercial

74
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:55,209
tomato controls they accumulate only

75
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,490
trace Asil sugars we have C 0 or 7 1 or

76
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,500
2 6 which is our acyl sugar benchmark

77
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,110
breeding line it accumulates about 15%

78
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,689
the level of acyl sugar of Solanum

79
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,959
Pinelli i la 7 1 6 we also have lines

80
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:10,180
that have a slow sugar level QTL that

81
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,280
modified the amount of acyl sugar we

82
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,140
have lines that modify but the Kimo type

83
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,390
of acyl sugars and importantly we have a

84
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:19,000
fatty acid 5 line and this line has a

85
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:21,250
Kimo type modulating QTL but it also has

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,169
a pleiotropic interaction with the acyl

87
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,780
sugar level that causes it to have a

88
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:28,419
level that's very low like celebrity and

89
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,370
m82 which gives us a very powerful and

90
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:33,458
closely related control to the rest of

91
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:37,390
the material here so here I am setting

92
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:39,459
up the the insect galleries the 2 leaves

93
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:41,229
Washington unwashed they're set in auger

94
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:44,289
so that the insect can only interact

95
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:46,899
with one side of the leaf disk then 10

96
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:48,969
female flower thrips 10 female Western

97
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,439
flower trees are inserted into the

98
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:52,989
center of the gallery and they're

99
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,629
allowed to feed and oviposit for about

100
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:58,180
24 hours after which point the leaf is

101
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:00,039
stained with McBride's solution d

102
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,080
stained with lactic acid and then under

103
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:07,090
the microscope I can count the eggs so

104
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,920
here's 1 &amp; 2 in this nice leaf disc and

105
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,439
what we find is that the probability

106
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,899
that a leaf or that a that a Western

107
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,259
flower thrip oviposit s' into the washed

108
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,269
leaf disk which is reduced in a so sugar

109
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:21,969
as opposed to the probability that it

110
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,009
oviposit s' into the unwashed acyl sugar

111
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,560
intact leaf disk is significantly

112
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:29,019
different for every single line in my

113
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,120
experiment and so it shows the effect of

114
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:33,069
removal of foliar accidents at least

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,780
temporarily but importantly the

116
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:37,149
magnitude of that difference there

117
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:38,529
across genotypes and so if I'm to take

118
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:40,209
this plot and just kind of clean it up a

119
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:43,359
little bit by just looking at the

120
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:45,250
unwashed leaf disks side by side by

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,560
genotype we see that same distribution

122
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,139
but it's more clear to see that some of

123
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,620
lines like fatty acid 7 and a so sugar

124
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:55,860
6/10 did particularly well in reducing

125
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,149
the probability of over position

126
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,980
especially when considered or when

127
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:01,569
compared to be commercial tomato

128
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,490
controls and are closely related

129
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:07,060
breeding line which has low pixel sugar

130
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,500
level the fatty acid 5 line now we did

131
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,689
the same thing for Tosca virus

132
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,149
inoculation except this time the trips

133
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:16,089
were infected with tswv and then we did

134
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:20,289
eliza at the end too to count the

135
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:22,599
incidence of infection and we see a very

136
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,939
similar trend where again fatty acid 7

137
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,550
and the acyl sugar 610 line are among

138
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:29,139
the best performing lines but

139
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,990
importantly you see quite a bit of

140
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:34,300
additional variation in this experiment

141
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,060
as opposed to this experiment and part

142
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,590
of that is due to differences in the

143
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:44,139
number of replicates but I also

144
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:46,389
hypothesize that the the amount of

145
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:49,899
inputs that go into the decision behind

146
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:52,360
OVA position may be greater than 4

147
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:54,819
tosspot virus or excuse me then for

148
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,770
feeding because there are real

149
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:59,769
ramifications for the survival of your

150
00:05:56,769 --> 00:06:01,899
offspring in deciding where to put your

151
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:03,759
eggs as opposed to where to just try and

152
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:05,168
feed it at a spot so you know like that

153
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,360
spot you can just move on to the next

154
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:10,029
spot and I think that maybe there might

155
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,560
be a connection between the difference

156
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:16,000
in the levity of those decisions and a

157
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,639
variation seen in these experiments we

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,379
also see that among the high acyl sugar

159
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,379
producing lines there's still quite a

160
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:25,300
bit of variation in insect response and

161
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:27,279
so you could ask the question well is

162
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,918
that variation due to the acyl sugar

163
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,439
level or due to changes in a so sugar

164
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,049
chemo type and I should remind you that

165
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,550
these lines here although they have QTL

166
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,350
that modified chemo type there's also

167
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,379
pleiotropic interactions between those

168
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:44,110
QTL and the acyl sugar level or amount

169
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:46,300
phenotype which allows us to do a

170
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,729
logistic regression for the probability

171
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,310
of ova position against the

172
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:53,228
Oh sugar level of a line and what we see

173
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,110
is that as the acyl sugar level

174
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:58,209
increases for a line the probability

175
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,460
that a trip lays its egg in the unwashed

176
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:02,109
leaf so that's the leaf with the acyl

177
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:05,560
sugar in it goes down significantly

178
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:09,310
almost to zero and the opposite is true

179
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,408
for the wash link disc we see a very

180
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,110
similar trend for tswv inoculate

181
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:16,269
inoculation where the probability of

182
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,330
infection in the unwashed leafiest drops

183
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:22,930
from about 60% again to about one to two

184
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:25,329
percent but you could also ask the

185
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,158
question well what about the chemo we

186
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:28,779
have all these fatty acids that we've

187
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:29,978
measured some of which are correlated

188
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:33,609
some of which are negatively correlated

189
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:37,889
or uncorrelated do any of these have an

190
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,610
impact in insect damaging behaviors and

191
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:41,620
unfortunately because of the

192
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,240
aforementioned pleiotropic interactions

193
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,699
between the QTL there's no way to

194
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,829
experimentally isolate the changes in

195
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,968
chemo type but we can still build a

196
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:51,098
model to try and make some educated

197
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:53,918
guesses as to what might be going on in

198
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:56,199
the background and that's exactly what

199
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,908
I've done here so I used minimum AIC

200
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,218
variables are minimum AIC model

201
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:02,769
selection criteria and a Bayesian

202
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:05,560
statistical framework called first bias

203
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:10,089
reduced maximum likelihood estimation -

204
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:13,718
and - and I also used am a forward step

205
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,788
wise variable selection to identify my

206
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:18,550
predictors from a pool of predictors

207
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:20,800
that best described over position rates

208
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,228
and that pool of predictors included the

209
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,389
overall aggregate amount of a so sugar

210
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:27,370
the amount of acyl sucrose verses days

211
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:29,620
of glucose and the amount of all of the

212
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,440
different individual quantitative fatty

213
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:35,019
acids and when you do that interestingly

214
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,149
it doesn't give you a model that shows a

215
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:39,338
so sugar level or amount but it gives

216
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:42,278
you a model that shows two of the

217
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:44,229
individual fatty acid predictors as most

218
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:47,019
explanatory so that's a straight chain

219
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:51,639
c12 molecule and I so branched a four

220
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:53,799
carbon molecule for tswv inoculation we

221
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,870
again find that a fatty acid is most

222
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,729
explanatory and that fatty acid is the

223
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,620
straight chain ten carbon molecule which

224
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,259
is highly correlated to the twelve

225
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,558
carbon molecule seeing as the

226
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:07,808
as the most significant variable in the

227
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:10,868
first model so in essence these models

228
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:12,159
are showing fairly similar things and so

229
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:13,720
what have we learned well we learned

230
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,418
that there are differences among lines

231
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,949
or insects over position and

232
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:23,259
transmission we learned that in some

233
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:25,808
cases lions do particularly well at

234
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:28,149
reducing the incidence of tomato spotted

235
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:29,769
wilt virus or over position we learned

236
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:32,048
that some of the variation among these

237
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:35,229
lines can be attributable to the amount

238
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:37,588
of a so sugar that a lion has but we can

239
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:41,220
do a better job of describing and

240
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:44,470
possibly predicting the insect response

241
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,809
by including chemo type or the amounts

242
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,609
of particular chemo types and we can use

243
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:50,978
that information to guide our breeding

244
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:54,369
efforts to produce insect resistant a so

245
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:56,799
sugar lines for the field and with that

246
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:59,470
I'd like to thank dr. Suh they've been

247
00:09:56,798 --> 00:10:01,358
Mahmood and dr. Diane Ullman at UC Davis

248
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,829
or my old bosses they helped a lot with

249
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:05,619
the design and implementation of this

250
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:08,138
experiment like to thank Tom Chapel at

251
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:11,168
Texas A&amp;M for independently replicating

252
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:14,519
my model using sass and I'd like to

253
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:16,480
thank the much the muchly lab for

254
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:20,078
supporting me and for showing me how to

255
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,278
do the chemical analysis in tomato all

256
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,278
right thank you very much

257
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:32,590
[Applause]

258
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:37,419
any questions for tailor mark if you

259
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:46,750
don't give him a choice or not you don't

260
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:48,759
give him a choice so I did I did a

261
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:52,480
background experiment where I gave them

262
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:55,120
two leaf disks with what was that were

263
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,170
both unwashed so they were as dis and

264
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,389
they were of tomatoes so they don't

265
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:01,000
produce a whole lot of hazel sugar and

266
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:02,889
in that case the split was 50/50 for OVA

267
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,830
position they didn't oviposit into it

268
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:14,049
does that answer your question

269
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:15,639
that was on Celebrity yeah yeah I didn't

270
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,889
test that I was just more testing for

271
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,419
aggregation preference so if like one

272
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:21,580
was saying hey come over here this leaf

273
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:24,610
is better and then there was basically

274
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,080
in effect for one of the least spatially

275
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:36,779
as opposed to do they sow sugar so I

276
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:42,550
didn't test that specifically rain just

277
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:45,039
completely it does it knocks it out by

278
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:47,620
about 75% of the answer sugars come back

279
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,939
so you can see here actually something

280
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,070
that you can't see in this case because

281
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,750
this is a binary random variable here we

282
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,220
have two binary random variables where

283
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,889
both leaves can be infected

284
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,100
both uninfected or one or the other and

285
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:01,779
you see actually that the difference is

286
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,070
that they trend together and so what

287
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:04,689
this means to me is we actually let them

288
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,760
feed for too long so we let them feed

289
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,780
for 24 hours and what it looks like is

290
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,970
for a period of time

291
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:11,740
the washed leaves were more attractive

292
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,629
but then the acyl Sugar's came back and

293
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,100
then you see that train again with a so

294
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:16,779
sugar levels which if they were

295
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,040
completely removed permanently you

296
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:25,600
wouldn't see that would just be a flat

297
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:28,509
line on top yes how was the reply it

298
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,950
sprinkle it was with a Nalgene bottle

299
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:35,139
the tip was cut off so it was wider and

300
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,440
why was that done just did a little

301
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,750
sprinkle water

302
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,430
Oh cuz you have you have to be fairly

303
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,480
vigorous to knock the ASA Sugar's off

304
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:44,750
exactly

305
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,690
so actually a rain unless you're talking

306
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:53,509
about tropical storm it's not for to be

307
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:56,110
polluting it yeah it's the power any

308
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:56,110
other questions

309
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:03,949
