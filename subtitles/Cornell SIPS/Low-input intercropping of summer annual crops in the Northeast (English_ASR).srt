University

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:13,619
today really lovely introduction

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,138
um I'd like to start out with some thank

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:18,660
yous of my own big thank you to my

6
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:19,858
committee Matt Lloyd drinkwater and

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,439
Harold

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,199
you guys have been wise and pragmatic

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,140
and encouraging and supportive and it's

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,800
really helped me shape my research

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,380
um

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,660
also a huge thank you to my lab the

13
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:36,420
sustainable cropping systems lab

14
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:39,599
seriously could have not couldn't have

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,000
done it without you all and I'm so

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,039
grateful and appreciative that we work

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,439
so well together as a team it's really

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,179
it's it's so much fun to go to work

19
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,339
every day

20
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,799
um a big thank you to Jerry cherny who

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,940
helped with 4-H quality Stephen mursky

22
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:59,218
my USDA collaborator Paul and Mike out

23
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,399
at the farm Dave Wilson from King's

24
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,579
aggregate who helped select uh seeds for

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,099
me big thank you to Sonam and to the

26
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:11,400
grad students within the department

27
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,059
and other plant science departments

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,740
um

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,978
so just a really straightforward

30
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,239
background some an outline of how the

31
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:20,819
presentation will go with some

32
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,798
background information some methods and

33
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,500
then the results section which I'll be

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,740
presenting in two parts one is crop

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,780
performance so a little bit about crop

36
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,699
production and the other one is more

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,640
applied so some of the benefits and

38
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,219
trade-offs of the different seed

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,719
treatments I use and then we'll do a

40
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,140
summary and then I'll tell you about

41
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,900
some future plans I have uh I couldn't

42
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,599
see this but I will be doing a PhD with

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,320
Matt I couldn't imagine leaving the lab

44
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,219
you know this winter anything so

45
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,459
um

46
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:59,039
just to start off with this is a graph

47
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:02,158
that describes the trend in dairy farms

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,340
distribution so on uh it's the number of

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,859
farms over time is declining and the

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,739
average Farm size is growing to me this

51
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:13,318
trend is very disturbing it's not just

52
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,659
for dairy farm it's true in other Ag

53
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,699
Systems

54
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:21,659
but particularly within dairy farms

55
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:25,859
there's been this huge decline 200 Farms

56
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:29,219
with less than 200 cows have the farm

57
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,400
size has decreased between 2000 2006 by

58
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:35,159
30 so that's really huge this trend is

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,560
is predicted to increase there are a lot

60
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,020
of structural differences that come with

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,539
Farm sizes and probably the biggest

62
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,879
takeaway of that for this presentation

63
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,500
is that smaller Farms smaller dairy

64
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,239
farms tend to grow more at their own

65
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,519
feed

66
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,980
this is a map that describes forage

67
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,900
projection in the United States so for

68
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:57,299
those who aren't familiar forage is the

69
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,080
edible plant part that isn't separated

70
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,879
the grain is not separated and the

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,840
forages are then fed chick raising

72
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:10,139
animals so cows sheep goats but in this

73
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,000
case mostly cows New York is a huge

74
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:15,500
producer of forage

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,199
third largest producer of corn silage

76
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,300
Alfalfa and Timothy also up there and

77
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,238
most of those forages go into Dairy

78
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,840
production and New York is the third

79
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:32,459
largest producer of milk in the country

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:37,319
this is a picture of the 2012 drought in

81
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:40,259
August I started grad school when at

82
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:41,839
this time so I started when this drought

83
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:44,459
was happening and when I was actually

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,000
studying agriculture for the first time

85
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,280
and it was it was very influential for

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,280
when my research eventually came to be

87
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,979
but it was also like a

88
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,400
it was huge it happened in the states

89
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:03,119
and 80 percent of of agricultural land

90
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,420
was affected 75 of corn and soybean

91
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,000
production were severely or greater

92
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,339
affected by the drought mostly in the

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,199
Heartland here but also you can see that

94
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,598
New York State up here it has some

95
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:19,139
different colors it was affected by the

96
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:22,740
drought and it was it was this that that

97
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,900
kind of took my research in a way uh on

98
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,720
a certain path and it was very emotional

99
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:30,179
for people I think we would drive past

100
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,060
and we would see the corn that was just

101
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,740
very stunted or we would see Farmers

102
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,220
standing in their fields just looking

103
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,918
lost and and and desolate they had no

104
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,900
idea what they could do and so one of

105
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,120
the options Farmers have is that they

106
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,879
could plant these summer annual forage

107
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,500
intercrops so typically right now

108
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,439
they're mostly known as these emergency

109
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,100
forages and they're planted after corn

110
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:57,899
failure but they also fit into the small

111
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,939
green system

112
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,219
so that's sometimes known as triple

113
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:04,860
cropping and that's when you have a

114
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,600
winter cereal and it's coming out so you

115
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,520
know like after traditionally or after

116
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,439
wheat and then you plant these things in

117
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,418
the middle of the summer and then the

118
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,699
growing season is short enough that you

119
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:17,219
can get them out in time to really

120
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:20,400
establish another cereal crop another

121
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,380
grain crop into the winter so you can

122
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,179
plant these between the middle of June

123
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,759
in the middle of July they're pretty

124
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,000
fast growing you can get a forage cut

125
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,240
between 35 45 days

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,639
um seeds reach maturity around 90 days

127
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,680
and the species I've selected for this

128
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,780
presentation for the research these are

129
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,139
drought tolerant and in general require

130
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:45,719
fewer inputs than corn silage

131
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,780
there's some very basic benefits for

132
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,080
inner cropping one you're decreasing the

133
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:54,839
risk by planting multiple species so by

134
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,579
having different species that react

135
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,679
differently that use the resources

136
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:00,719
differently you're spreading out that

137
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,139
risk and you're really tapping into the

138
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,380
functional diversity of the plants this

139
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:09,780
in turn increases the resilience of the

140
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:12,120
ecosystem and it strengthens it because

141
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:13,739
you really are depending on the species

142
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,500
that are there and the things that come

143
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,240
with it by changing the pasture or weed

144
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,759
pressure on

145
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,699
changing the microbial communities of

146
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,340
the soil and instead of relying on these

147
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,100
external inputs which I think are is

148
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,799
quite a fragile system and so this is

149
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,360
also Pearson causes the regenerative

150
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,699
semi-close

151
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,740
uh agriculture so it's when the

152
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,180
nutrients are kind of coming off of the

153
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,220
farm and then if you have a dairy

154
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,660
production that when you were staying on

155
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,280
the farm so if you think about it in

156
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,860
terms of where the nutrients are going

157
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,339
it's a more closed structure than if

158
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:53,460
you're exporting nutrients to and from

159
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:56,519
uh this is a

160
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:58,680
so some related summer annual intercrops

161
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,740
I think there's a growing interest among

162
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,379
farmers and certainly the nrcs has been

163
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,780
promoting the summer annual intercrops

164
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:10,740
as cover crop cocktails and mixtures

165
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:12,959
this is Ray Archuleta from the nrcs

166
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,840
um I think we should make a motivational

167
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:19,500
poster of this for the lab is this is

168
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:22,918
this nrcs guy directing us to plant a

169
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:26,339
summer annual intercrops uh there's been

170
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:28,500
research done by Kevin Armstrong in 2008

171
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:32,219
they were comparing grass flaking

172
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:35,038
mixtures for forage quality for

173
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,199
um with corn silage and and they tested

174
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,259
out some different legumes and they said

175
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,220
that the loblobin

176
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:43,680
increased the forage quality because

177
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,960
you're in you're increasing the crude

178
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,060
protein but you're not decreasing the

179
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,598
yield so that's pretty key for Farmers

180
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,240
you don't want to take a yield cut uh

181
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:57,538
Dan Brainerd also did some research with

182
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Robin belinder regarding grass legging

183
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:02,159
mixtures they chose two grasses and two

184
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,978
legumes and the best combination they

185
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,740
found was a cow pee with Millet which

186
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:10,560
improved noduation it lowered the seed

187
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,500
costs because the grains are this

188
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,720
expensive than the legumes and also you

189
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,339
they managed to reduce the weed seed

190
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,940
Productions and if they were planting

191
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:23,279
the cow pea separately

192
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:26,459
so some considerations with inner

193
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,258
cropping I find intercopying experiments

194
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:30,239
they're very challenging because they

195
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,060
get so big so fast because you're like

196
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,099
what species should I look at oh and I

197
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,538
should look at also I should look at the

198
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,180
seating rate and all of a sudden you

199
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:41,580
have like 500 different treatments and

200
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,439
then your committee says

201
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,300
probably shouldn't have 500 different

202
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,040
achievements

203
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:48,778
um so species selection is very

204
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,338
important and even within species

205
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,620
different cultivar selection is

206
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,360
important the seeding rates you choose

207
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,120
and then the ratio of those seeding

208
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,120
rates to the other species as well as

209
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,480
the soil fertility so you know depending

210
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,879
on your your

211
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,339
your uh like your playing field where

212
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,778
you're starting off with really

213
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,700
um

214
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:14,580
what am I trying to say it really

215
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,500
affects the crop production later on so

216
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,180
if you have very fertile soil then

217
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,879
perhaps the grasses would do better but

218
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:23,519
if you have more legumes and less

219
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,778
fertile soil then the leggings would do

220
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,740
better

221
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:31,919
so just to summarize my entire two and a

222
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,778
half years here uh in one slide I'm

223
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,879
testing the ecological Theory and

224
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:38,278
quantifying potential benefits from

225
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,100
inner cropping and I'm doing this within

226
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:43,740
an alternative warm season drought

227
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,259
tolerant functionally diverse cropping

228
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,379
mixture in the Northeast and in the

229
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:51,778
Mid-Atlantic and I'm also so these two

230
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,939
points these are like a little more

231
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:56,100
theoretical but I'm very much interested

232
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,380
in how does this knowledge apply to

233
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,420
Farmers how can people use this

234
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:02,399
information and so I really want to

235
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:05,219
quantify the trade-offs between forage

236
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,500
quality and yield and determine optimal

237
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,899
management I really would like to tell

238
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,200
farmers at the end I've tested this and

239
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:17,580
I think this is the best mixture or the

240
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,500
best thing you can do in your situation

241
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,500
so I have two main research questions

242
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,360
the first is how do crops the reform and

243
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,220
are there even benefits to Inner

244
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,440
cropping and the second research

245
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,899
question is what are the trade-offs

246
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,200
between yield and forage quality over

247
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,200
time

248
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,420
free PC selection I chose four species

249
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:43,259
and I based it off of two different

250
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:45,360
functional traits so nitrogen fixing

251
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:48,299
ability whether a plant is a grass or

252
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,639
legume and also plant architecture so

253
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:53,819
the stature of the plant whether it's

254
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:56,699
bushy or taller and so for the two

255
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,220
grasses I chose a hybrid Pearl Millet

256
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,040
and it's abbreviated with an m and it's

257
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,440
throughout the presentation

258
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:07,919
and it's the shorter variety of millet

259
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,680
used for 4-H and then for the Tall Grass

260
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:14,099
I use sorghum Sudan grass the BMR

261
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:16,500
variety it's a cross between sorghum and

262
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:20,579
sorghum Sudanese grass and it looks very

263
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:24,600
similar to Corn it grows quite tall

264
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:26,519
with the two legumes I use cow pee in

265
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,639
the sauce we call them black-eyed peas

266
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:32,879
they're abbreviated with the c and then

267
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:36,419
Sun hemp uh in San hemp is abbreviated

268
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:39,000
with an H in Sun hemp I think is the

269
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:43,099
least Familiar of these crops to this

270
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,419
audience is native to India it's this

271
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,000
fiber and forage crop that they grow

272
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,740
there and it's and it's tall it goes

273
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,519
quite tall and it's very beautiful and

274
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,320
it the leaves in the stem are iridescent

275
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,799
um

276
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:02,519
so I had two growing Seasons a 2013 and

277
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,919
2014 and three different field sites we

278
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:09,000
were at Beltsville Maryland the USDA

279
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:12,059
headquarters uh and then Aurora New York

280
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,759
which is about 40 miles away from here

281
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:17,039
and then our most northern site was in

282
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,740
willsboro New York and so that was in

283
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:23,819
the middle of that Adirondacks next to

284
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:26,399
Vermont and we had a different number of

285
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,459
fields so if there was times two then we

286
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,620
had two fields at that field site we

287
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:34,078
planted between the middle of June to

288
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,019
the middle of July we had four to six

289
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:40,259
reps per site

290
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:43,078
the experiment design we prepped the

291
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:45,838
seed beds this is Chris on our on our

292
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:49,559
tractor so we prep the seabeds plowed

293
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,079
just cultipact we applied 35 kilograms

294
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:55,500
per hectare of nitrogen in the form of

295
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:58,439
poultry litter and 35 kilograms is half

296
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:02,820
the recommended amount as sorghum

297
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:05,160
sedan grass and the idea for for doing

298
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,019
it like that is that if we fertilize at

299
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,179
the full recommendation then we're

300
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,220
really shifting that fertility that

301
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:13,439
competition over to the grasses which

302
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,259
are able to use that nitrogen more

303
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,240
efficiently than the legumes and then if

304
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:20,159
we didn't fertilize it all we're afraid

305
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,379
we would shift the competition too much

306
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:25,259
to the legumes and so we split the

307
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:28,679
difference and decided 35 was was a good

308
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:30,179
number uh no pesticides or herbicides

309
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:33,838
were applied I think that's pretty

310
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:36,239
typical for a forage system but

311
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,060
this is low input so I would like to

312
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,180
emphasize that and seeds were drilled to

313
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:45,359
four centimeters down and plot signs it

314
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:48,958
plot sizes range from 9 to 40 meters

315
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,539
squared this was a single cut so in some

316
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,479
forages you can take multiple Cuts over

317
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,939
time and then you take cuts of the

318
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,860
regrowth but because we're using a

319
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,959
mixture of species they have different

320
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,839
maternity dates different regrowth rates

321
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:07,559
we just did a single cut system that was

322
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,260
also a way to keep the number of the

323
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,199
number of samplings down into the

324
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:15,059
pragmatic sphere

325
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,399
uh proceed treatment so we have the four

326
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,619
species in monoculture and these are

327
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,740
their seeding rates here in this middle

328
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,919
column and again the abbreviations and

329
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:29,459
then the cost per hectare of those

330
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,379
um seeds and then we tested four three

331
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:34,979
species mixtures and they're indicated

332
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:36,720
with an X and then we have their cost

333
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,539
per hectare and of course the one

334
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,620
possible for a species mixture

335
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:45,958
been seating uh the seating rates were

336
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,560
for the three species mixture each

337
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:52,619
species was seated at one third of its

338
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:55,739
rate in monoculture so if you're looking

339
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,440
at Millet in a three CC's mixture 21

340
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,440
divided by three so you're seating at

341
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,120
seven kilograms per hectare and then for

342
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,079
the fourth species rate you're seating

343
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,240
at one quarter of its monoculture rate

344
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:10,620
and there was a randomized complete

345
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,220
block design

346
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:17,220
a different sampling methods so uh we

347
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,620
took crop density crop biomass and weed

348
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:23,278
biomass we essentially obeyed a half

349
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:26,100
meter Square quadrat down and we clipped

350
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,078
at 10 centimeters above the soil this

351
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,519
was to simulate a forage cut where

352
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,099
they're not going to be clipping right

353
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,100
at the soil level but a little bit above

354
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:38,399
and then crossword separated out by

355
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,720
species and then uh dried and then later

356
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,799
weighed

357
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:47,240
we had two sampling dates in 2013 45

358
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:50,698
days and 90 days after planting and in

359
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:54,299
2014 we added an additional sampling

360
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:57,899
date at 35 days and so that was to the

361
00:15:54,299 --> 00:16:00,359
purpose of that was to really get to the

362
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:03,419
to the forage quality question how does

363
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,680
forage quality change over 35 and 45

364
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:09,419
days which is kind of The Sweet Spot

365
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,578
in addition to the biomass sampling we

366
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:14,099
also took light Transmissions to assess

367
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:16,319
the canopy cover we did that by a

368
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,899
sliding a line sensor underneath the

369
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,079
canopy and then having a holding a

370
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,759
pointerest point sensor above the canopy

371
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,099
and then taking simultaneous

372
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,600
measurements and that was to capture how

373
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,600
much light was passing through the

374
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,360
canopy and also we did take some soil

375
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,220
samples to understand the Baseline

376
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,820
fertility of the soil that we were

377
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,820
working in

378
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,278
free data analysis for this presentation

379
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,220
I'll be talking to you about the 45 days

380
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:49,799
pulled across sites in years there

381
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,720
weren't major site differences all the

382
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,479
orders of the treatment were pretty

383
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,540
similar across all the sites there were

384
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,399
really big year differences

385
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:02,939
um I don't know if you all noticed but

386
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:06,240
2014 was quite a bit colder than 2013

387
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:11,058
for the summer so the biomass production

388
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,980
in 2014 was almost half of that in 2013.

389
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:16,379
uh to analyze the data we did an

390
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,980
analysis I did an analysis of variance

391
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,799
with treatment as effective fixed effect

392
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,779
and gear block and location were

393
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,879
considered random effects and then I

394
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:30,480
used a two key tests to show the

395
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,880
differences between the means

396
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,839
so this is the results section part one

397
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:40,380
the crop performance part

398
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:42,659
and this is a couple of shots of us in

399
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,360
the field this is last year at Aurora

400
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,100
about a month after planting and the

401
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,139
letters here indicate the seeding

402
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:51,538
treatments so you can see the cowpea and

403
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,460
monoculture the canopy really hadn't

404
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:56,700
closed especially if you look at the

405
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:59,340
four species mixture and then two months

406
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,200
later you see here the Millet and the

407
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:03,899
sun hemp were planted in monoculture

408
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,259
they're looking very full and nice but

409
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:10,080
when you look at the species mixtures

410
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:12,480
they just have so much texture they just

411
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,839
look like they're taking up so much more

412
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,839
space

413
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,580
this is data for the 45 days after

414
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,219
planting pools across sites and years

415
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:25,439
and this is the total biomass and down

416
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,720
at the bottom we have the four species

417
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,940
in monoculture the four three species

418
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,100
mixtures and then the 1 4 species

419
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:35,340
mixture and then the crop by 11

420
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:38,639
kilograms per hectare on the y-axis

421
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:41,839
and you can see that the legumes in

422
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,940
monoculture did not really do that well

423
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,619
the grasses

424
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,919
we're very similar and very similar to

425
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:51,899
the mixtures with Millet sorghum Sun

426
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,200
hemp producing the highest amount of

427
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,298
biomass and then the story gum Sun hemp

428
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,798
copy producing the lowest amount of

429
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:00,798
biomass in the mixtures

430
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,900
this is a graph the same one you saw

431
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:10,859
before it except now you can see the

432
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:13,200
composition of the mixtures and so each

433
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:15,298
color stands for a monoculture and then

434
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,660
here you can see a lot of purple and

435
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:20,879
green and those are the the grasses and

436
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,480
they make up quite a bit of that crop

437
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,480
biomass

438
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:30,418
dominant weeds we had quite a we had

439
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:32,879
some issues with volunteer crops

440
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,580
depending on our field sites so at one

441
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,720
site in willsboro we went in after a

442
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:43,379
canola variety trial and there was a lot

443
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,779
of canola but so it was like very

444
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,900
terrible because we considered it weed

445
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:52,379
biomass in reality though that stuff

446
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,940
makes great forage so it was Mike kept

447
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,640
trying to convince me oh you should run

448
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:59,038
the the forage quality analysis with the

449
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,440
weed biomass and I was like yes I would

450
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,779
love to do that because like we know

451
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,480
this would be so much higher

452
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:10,379
um we also had some issues with some

453
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:13,620
volunteer wheat uh so at Aurora we had a

454
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:16,080
later planting date and I think Paul was

455
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:19,199
driving his tractor driving the combine

456
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:21,058
off the field as Chris was driving uh

457
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,200
the tractor onto the field to prepare

458
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:27,298
the weed seed bed so any uh wheat that

459
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,058
that didn't make it onto the combine had

460
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:32,940
a very nice weed seed bed to grow into

461
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:34,798
but again it made it first and it would

462
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:39,840
probably make for some decent forage

463
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:42,179
quality another field we had in this an

464
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,819
issue with mustard I'll talk a little

465
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:47,038
bit more about that in a second and then

466
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:48,480
pretty much the usual suspects of Summer

467
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:53,879
annual

468
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:57,240
um weeds Ragweed pigweed lamb's quarter

469
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:01,020
so here we have a weird phytometer and

470
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:05,279
this mustard in bloom was beautiful it

471
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:07,379
was it really was beautiful and and it

472
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,779
was great also overseeing the treatment

473
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,900
differences so you can just look here

474
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:14,940
and I've divided these fields uh this

475
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,919
field by the different treatments you

476
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,279
can see the mixture that contained the

477
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,160
Sorghum was very good at at

478
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,859
um out competing the mustard but this

479
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,720
very dark yellow lots of yellow down in

480
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:30,719
this corner this was a cow peeing

481
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,640
monoculture so it really you could just

482
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:38,298
tell the difference of how competitive

483
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,299
some species in some mixtures were

484
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:46,620
this graph shows a crop biomass in the

485
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:50,879
brown and the weed biomass in the yellow

486
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:53,759
bars on top so you can see that the

487
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,419
legume monocultures produce

488
00:21:53,759 --> 00:22:00,779
the most weeds grasses were not very

489
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:03,240
weedy some of the mixtures didn't have

490
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:07,500
that many weeds they were all a little

491
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,659
similar though and as terrible as the

492
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,819
cowpea and Sun hemp where it's

493
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,340
suppressing weeds they certainly did a

494
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:18,058
good job more than they could have in

495
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:20,459
2014 we had a control plot we put

496
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:22,139
control plots in all of our Fields you

497
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,860
can really tell

498
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,880
um

499
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:27,839
like

500
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:32,419
like how how much less weeds there are

501
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,418
um even when just something was planted

502
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:37,500
so in addition to the crop production

503
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,840
and the crop biomass and the weed

504
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,538
biomass also doing some additional

505
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,639
metrics land equivalent ratio which

506
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:48,359
measures the efficiency of mixtures

507
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,100
relative to monocultures the crop growth

508
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,099
rate would just shows the change in

509
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:57,000
biomass over the change in time and also

510
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:59,158
species evenness by biomass which shows

511
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,679
the relative production measures the

512
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:04,500
relative production and species

513
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,980
dominance and so these are all like

514
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,079
three kind of snapshots of how these

515
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:14,220
mixtures performed and how the species

516
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,220
within the mixtures performed

517
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,519
the first one land equivalent ratio it

518
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,859
is the sum of the ratios of inner crop

519
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:25,558
yield for a species divided by the

520
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:28,678
monoculture yield I've tried to depict

521
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:31,558
it in this cartoon here so uh in the

522
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,780
inner crop you can see that all the

523
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,720
species grow better than when they're

524
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:39,599
planted separately in monoculture and

525
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,360
this is due to less intra-specific

526
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:45,538
competition so Liars that are greater

527
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:48,079
than one describe when intercops are

528
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:52,339
more efficient than monocultures

529
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:54,960
and very exciting we all the mixtures

530
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:58,879
that were planted for this experiment

531
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,159
had lures that were greater than one so

532
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,360
all of these mixtures were more

533
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,360
efficient

534
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:09,058
than we're more efficient in terms of

535
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:11,339
biomass production per space than if

536
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:15,079
this species had been separated out

537
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:15,079
implanted in monoculture

538
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:22,798
this is crab growth rate measured in

539
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:26,279
kilograms per hectare per day and here

540
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:28,859
we have two columns for the grasses and

541
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,019
two columns for the legumes and I showed

542
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:32,879
the slope up here you can see the crop

543
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:36,900
growth tweets for the grasses in

544
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,000
monoculture are really high so it shows

545
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,100
like a much steeper slope than the

546
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,700
legumes which have a lower crop growth

547
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,279
rate and they have a smaller slope so I

548
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,380
just want to walk you through this one

549
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:51,899
Millet growth rate when it was in

550
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:55,200
monoculture it was about 17 kilograms

551
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:58,519
per hectare per day and then when it was

552
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,319
planted in these mixtures it

553
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:03,359
decreased in this mixture it didn't

554
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:06,538
decrease significantly so the growth

555
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:09,058
rate in when it was planted with the sun

556
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:12,359
hemp and the copy was similar to that as

557
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:14,940
if it were planted in monoculture and

558
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:17,939
the other growth rates decreased a half

559
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,679
maybe a third a similar Trend you see

560
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,360
with sore government has a very high

561
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,200
crop growth rate when it was in

562
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:27,538
monoculture and it falls

563
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,538
when it is planted in mixture so

564
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:33,720
remember you're also seating at like one

565
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:37,500
third to a quarter of the

566
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:40,259
uh monoculture rate the legumes are a

567
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,839
little bit of a sadder story

568
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:45,658
um so their crop growth rate in

569
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:48,558
monoculture were lower just in general

570
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:50,640
than the grasses like so these plants

571
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,038
characteristics just have a slower

572
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,360
growth rate and when they were planted

573
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:58,500
with mixtures uh it just got romped a

574
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,979
little

575
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,960
um cow pea fell by a decrease the crop

576
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,900
grocery decreased by an order of

577
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,519
magnitude and so it was

578
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,980
really

579
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:14,058
um facing a lot of competition when it

580
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,058
was intercropped

581
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:19,740
so the third snapshot the third

582
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,919
additional metric I want to describe to

583
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,259
you is species evenness and usually

584
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,080
species evenness is done with plant

585
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:31,259
density we thought that doing it by

586
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:34,980
biomass was a little bit more revealing

587
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:37,619
uh here we see low evenness in this

588
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,900
cartoon and you can see that the sun's

589
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:42,178
the one species is much bigger than the

590
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,240
other species and then a high evenness

591
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:49,019
means that you know the plants grow

592
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,778
similarly well so species even this is a

593
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:54,240
metric that goes from zero to one and

594
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:57,119
the blue bars here indicate the evenness

595
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,558
at 45 days in the brown bars or even

596
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:04,439
this at 90 days and so we see that

597
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:07,319
military gum Sun hemp it was the most

598
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,679
even species at 45 days and also the

599
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:13,200
most even at 90 days and that just says

600
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,059
those three species when they're planted

601
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,640
together if you think of them as a team

602
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:20,399
each teammate is holding its own weight

603
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,400
a little bit more than if you had

604
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,798
sorghum Sun hemp and cowpea you can just

605
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,559
imagine that cow pee was dominating it

606
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:31,740
was gonna it like its growth definitely

607
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:34,019
was much greater than the sun hemp and

608
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,419
the cow pea

609
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:40,139
uh just in general

610
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:41,340
species evenness decreased over time so

611
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,700
so

612
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:48,058
as the growing season went on there was

613
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:50,759
a decrease as one species became more

614
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:53,480
dominant than other species in some of

615
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:53,480
these mixtures

616
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:59,460
so it is summarize this part of the

617
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:02,159
results section mixture is produced a

618
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,019
similar amount of biomass as grass

619
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,960
monocultures

620
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:09,599
there is over yielding seen by all the

621
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,558
mixtures indicated by an elyr greater

622
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,719
than one

623
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,658
and there is a higher crop growth rate

624
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,319
in general in the monocultures except

625
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:22,440
for millet with sun hemp and cowpea

626
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:25,079
mixtures with two grasses tended to be

627
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,778
more even and mixtures with two leggings

628
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:32,178
tended to be less even and there is a

629
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:32,179
decrease in evenness over time

630
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:37,918
so now I want to switch to the more

631
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,080
applied findings the different

632
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,679
um the second results section

633
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:45,599
and this goes back to the question what

634
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,919
are the what are the trade-offs between

635
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:53,699
yields and forage quality over time and

636
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,759
so it's a very short primer on forage

637
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,038
quality a forged quality tends to

638
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,500
decrease

639
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:04,259
over time as the plants get larger while

640
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,819
the yield tends to increase

641
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:09,419
and so

642
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:11,700
that that reason uh we'll see is because

643
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:14,520
when the plants are younger they have a

644
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:17,159
lower fiber content that fiber content

645
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,619
means the animal can consume more of

646
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,720
that diet and also it's it's higher

647
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:23,778
energy because it's full of these the

648
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,240
cell content through full of these

649
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:31,919
nutritious digestible like quickly

650
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:34,558
digestible things sugars proteins as the

651
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,480
plant ages there's an increase in these

652
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,519
structural carbohydrates that make up

653
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,480
the cell wall particularly Hemi

654
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:44,639
cellulose and cellulose and so when it's

655
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,659
a high fiber diet when the when the

656
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,759
plant is older then they

657
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:53,940
then there's a lower intake by The

658
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:55,500
Animals because they feel

659
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,278
um Fuller

660
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,859
they they have more fiber when they're

661
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:05,700
when they're eating that and because

662
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:09,058
they can't cannot consume as much there

663
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,440
is a lower energy uh just in general of

664
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:13,259
the diet

665
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,340
so this is relative feed value at 35

666
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:20,339
days uh in 2014

667
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:23,418
and relative feed value is this metric

668
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:26,519
between digestibility and fiber content

669
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:28,440
and it was used by the industry for a

670
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,139
very long time before it became

671
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:35,100
affordable to test for the protein

672
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:37,919
content I was not able to get the

673
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:42,019
protein analysis done in time for this

674
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,700
presentation so I'm using this metric

675
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:46,619
even though it only tells part of the

676
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:51,000
story because it doesn't require any

677
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:52,918
protein content the relative feed value

678
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,440
it's um

679
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:58,380
relative feed values this metric that

680
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,480
that's based off of forage legumes and

681
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:04,260
it tells you gives you this one number

682
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:07,019
of how good or not a forage is and so we

683
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:09,720
can see the relative feed value is quite

684
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:13,740
high for the legumes and this metric

685
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:16,740
tends to over uh to underestimate forage

686
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:19,980
quality for grasses so that's the reason

687
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,620
it's not used as much anymore and so the

688
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,558
grasses in monoculture are quite low

689
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:28,278
then we have these mixtures the military

690
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:30,898
sorghum or sorry the military

691
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:33,298
has the highest forage quality of all

692
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:36,538
the mixtures and the other mixtures

693
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:39,359
perform similarly well

694
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:42,359
um these yellow bars here indicate what

695
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,639
kind of feed you would like to give to a

696
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:46,558
cow the brighter yellow is what you

697
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,860
would the kind of quality of feed you

698
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:54,359
would give to a lactating cow and the

699
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:57,359
less yellow the Browner bar is feet

700
00:31:54,359 --> 00:32:00,058
that's still good enough but maybe not

701
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,519
as much energy that you would give to a

702
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:05,579
cow that is producing milk

703
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:07,740
so you can see that uh most

704
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:10,439
mostly except for this tournament just

705
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:13,500
by a little bit all fit into this range

706
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:17,278
that it's safe to feed uh and even good

707
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:20,519
to feed for lactating cows and again

708
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:25,099
this metric really underestimates the

709
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,099
forage quality of the grasses

710
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,000
this next part uh this next graph really

711
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,119
tries to answer the question of what are

712
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,659
the trade-offs between yields and the

713
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:39,000
forage quality and so the way the best

714
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:41,340
way to do this metric was just to

715
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,099
multiply the relative feed value by the

716
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:47,819
yield so we know that the grasses had a

717
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:50,879
very high yield compared to the legumes

718
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:54,058
but we also know that the grasses didn't

719
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,700
have that great of a forage quality and

720
00:32:54,058 --> 00:33:00,240
here we see these big differences so the

721
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:03,298
purple bars are the first harvest at 35

722
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,140
days and then the green are 45 days and

723
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:08,759
the Blue 90 days we see some really nice

724
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,659
High

725
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,179
um

726
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:14,820
High bars for these legumes when they're

727
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:17,700
in monoculture and that falls and part

728
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:20,460
of its flowing is due to a decrease in

729
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,679
forage quality over time but part of it

730
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,140
is also to the fact that they don't

731
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,899
yield quite as much as the motor the

732
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:32,120
Sorghum so you have yield that's really

733
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:32,119
pushing up These Bars here

734
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:37,199
I didn't want to overwhelm you all with

735
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:40,019
with the all the bars all at once but

736
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,259
here are the different mixtures you can

737
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:45,480
see that the Millet Sun hemp coffee had

738
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:47,879
the highest forage quality for the

739
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,759
mixture it falls

740
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,340
um and then yield really takes over for

741
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:55,919
some of the yields is making up the

742
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:59,119
difference in the bar sizes for some of

743
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,120
these other mixtures

744
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,519
so just in general I want to summarize

745
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,119
that there were a lot of sight year

746
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,239
differences for forage quality

747
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:13,980
Forest quality decreased over time

748
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:16,378
optimal Harvest for the grasses and the

749
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:20,398
mixtures using the relative feed value

750
00:34:16,378 --> 00:34:23,098
metric was at 35 days

751
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,799
um leggings contain less fiber and work

752
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:28,379
more digestible and grasses in

753
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,200
monoculture had a higher fiber content

754
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:33,659
and because most of the mixtures the

755
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,059
majority of that mixture the biomass of

756
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:39,240
that mixture was

757
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:43,219
um grasses the mixtures also had quite a

758
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,219
high fiber content as well

759
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,379
here I would like to touch on the

760
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:52,918
economics I'm really excited to develop

761
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:55,858
some of these ideas more but

762
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,858
but here we have the cost per hectare

763
00:34:55,858 --> 00:35:00,659
that we saw at the beginning for the

764
00:34:57,858 --> 00:35:04,139
seeds for the different seed treatments

765
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:06,239
we have 35 days 45 days and 90 days

766
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:08,759
production per dollar so that's

767
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:12,539
kilograms per dollar

768
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,900
and you can see really that Millet has

769
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:19,019
this very low seating cost per hectare

770
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,880
and this is for a couple of different

771
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:23,219
reasons one

772
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,980
but related reasons

773
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:28,019
um the costume really is so much lower

774
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:31,679
is because the seeding rate in general

775
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:34,139
is so much slower it was 21 versus 60 or

776
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:36,779
80 for some of the others

777
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:38,639
and the seeds for millet are quite a bit

778
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,040
smaller than some of the other seed

779
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,838
treatments so you can plant less of it

780
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:46,199
it's less expensive

781
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:50,039
and it's really it's really driving the

782
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:53,219
trend here for the in the production per

783
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:55,800
dollar this is also seen here with the

784
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:57,959
Millet sorghum Sun hemp produced the

785
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,480
most and it had the highest production

786
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,820
per dollar

787
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,400
uh I think one of the challenges that

788
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:10,140
I've seen when doing this research is

789
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:12,780
that the seed cost to me seem pretty

790
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:15,838
prohibitive for Farmers to actually do

791
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:18,119
but I think part of that is because of

792
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:20,880
the seed economies of scale so if more

793
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:22,858
people adopted this practice it would

794
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,980
drive down the price that you would have

795
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:28,739
more suppliers entering the the market

796
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:31,800
and producing varieties that you know

797
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:33,799
are high yielding for this region at a

798
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,619
lower cost

799
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:40,260
uh and also forgot to mention this the

800
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:42,660
fourth species mixture came out right in

801
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,200
the middle between all the three species

802
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,199
mixtures

803
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,300
um so some final recommendations uh we

804
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:54,299
looked at a lot of different metrics we

805
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,700
looked at yield we looked at weed

806
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,280
biomass weed suppression and we looked

807
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:00,739
at the forage quality we touched on the

808
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,839
cost so there are a lot of different

809
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:06,539
factors in play as to what I would

810
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:09,119
recommend Farmers to do

811
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:11,219
um just to summarize Millet had the

812
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,180
greatest production It produced the most

813
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:18,358
biomass and it was the lower cost by far

814
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:21,179
military sorghum send him mixture had

815
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:23,460
the greatest production of a mixture and

816
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:26,578
it also had the lowest cost per mixture

817
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,800
at a really high ler and a really high

818
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:30,480
evenness that I was saying you know the

819
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,900
sun hemp wasn't being completely

820
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,719
dominated by the Millet or the Sorghum

821
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:39,119
and the rfv uh the relative feed value

822
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,739
was near that threshold for lactating

823
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,680
cows it was the highest producing

824
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:45,838
perhaps with a better forage quality

825
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:50,039
metric it would put it into that range

826
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:53,880
of being a good forage quality

827
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:56,579
the million Sun hemp cow pea mixture had

828
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:00,420
the greatest forage quality was also the

829
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:02,519
least most weird suppressive uh and in

830
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,099
that mixture the Millet had the same

831
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:07,679
growth rate as it did in monoculture so

832
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:10,800
you're not taking a yield loss if you

833
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:13,259
were to just if you were going to have

834
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,880
the mindset of planting a grass with

835
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,260
some additional legumes you weren't

836
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:23,119
taking a a yield Blaster but it had a

837
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,119
little bit of a higher production cost

838
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,980
um to close I just want to talk a little

839
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:32,459
bit about some of my PhD work that's

840
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:34,559
also had two growing seasons and maybe

841
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,619
some of you were wondering what about

842
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:40,019
those bicultures well don't worry

843
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:41,700
they're coming

844
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:44,460
um so for this work for these

845
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:47,519
experiments which are also called safe

846
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:50,579
the summer animal forage experiments I'm

847
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:53,039
looking at monoculture rates so that

848
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:56,579
that recommended seeding rate and how it

849
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:59,338
changes and if you're planting how the

850
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:03,599
biomass changes at 70 of the seating

851
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:05,279
rate or 90 of this heating rate and also

852
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,260
looking at all the bicultural

853
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,839
combinations so there are four species

854
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,540
there are six possible biculture

855
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,820
combinations and more than that more

856
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:17,820
than just looking at like 50 50 of

857
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:20,160
millet and sorghum and 50 50 of millet

858
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,880
and Sun hemp I'm really

859
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,098
um

860
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,300
I'm really looking at different seating

861
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:29,180
rate ratios so like 20 percent Millet

862
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:33,000
and then like 60

863
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:35,159
sorghum and doing that for all six

864
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,159
combinations of bicultures to really

865
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:40,799
understand what are what are the

866
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:42,719
Dynamics within the seeding rate ratios

867
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,000
and how does that relate to the

868
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,858
recommended seeding rates of these

869
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,500
species in monoculture

870
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:52,078
and so then I would like I will be doing

871
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,940
some modeling of the competition between

872
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,920
the inner crops really getting an

873
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,720
interest specific competition and

874
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,720
inter-specific competition

875
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,338
um and finally for for some other future

876
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,920
work

877
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:11,400
I'm gonna be doing some farmer

878
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,619
interviews understanding metrics I'm I'm

879
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,079
really interested in understanding the

880
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:18,358
metrics for behavior

881
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,119
um change in terms of agricultural

882
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:23,338
production so what policies need to be

883
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,980
there that would influence farmer

884
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:27,179
decision making what barriers cannot be

885
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,880
there

886
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:31,858
I think this is incredibly important and

887
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,220
it's something I'm very interested in

888
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:38,460
it's in that that expansion stage of a

889
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:40,799
PhD where you're saying yes and this and

890
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:43,320
yes and this and it hasn't been

891
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,320
condensed yet but in general I'm so

892
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,940
interested in science communication the

893
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,240
relationship and the communication

894
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,579
between uh scientists and farmers and

895
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:56,879
scientists in the general public I'm

896
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:59,880
also interested in agricultural policy

897
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,880
potentially

898
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:05,880
after a PhD may be going to Washington

899
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,640
um

900
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,300
so with that I will take some time for

901
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,299
questions

902
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:25,619
this has been a production of Cornell

903
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,619
University on the web at cornell.edu
