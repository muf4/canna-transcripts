00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:04,404
This is a production of Cornell University

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:06,405


3
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:10,375
&gt;&gt; As Nina just demonstrated,

4
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:12,835
soils are composed of

5
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,785
different percentages of different size particles,

6
00:00:15,785 --> 00:00:17,809
sand, silt, and clay.

7
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,964
We have a technique we can demonstrate now that will give us

8
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:26,112
an approximation of those representative percentages.

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:30,812
Those percentages are indicated on the USDA texture triangle,

10
00:00:30,993 --> 00:00:32,853
which we also have with us here.

11
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:35,755
This technique that's going to give us

12
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:38,728
an approximation of the percentages,

13
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,155
is going to give us an indication of the soil texture.

14
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:47,388
By running through this flow chart here,

15
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:48,804
we're going to end up with

16
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:55,138
a rough estimation of the texture of these two samples of soil.

17
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:57,463
We have two samples here and I'm going to

18
00:00:57,585 --> 00:01:00,270
start with this one here.

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,770
We're just going to run through the process on our flowchart.

20
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,394
It starts with taking a small amount of the soil in the hand.

21
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,326
This is soil texture by feel or by

22
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:16,794
hand and we're going to sort the soil a little bit,

23
00:01:17,197 --> 00:01:20,537
removing sticks and stones,

24
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:25,337
elements larger than the largest particle of sand

25
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:30,141
that do not form part of the overall textural composition.

26
00:01:30,364 --> 00:01:33,409
I'm just pulling out the stones,

27
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:38,143
some of these are just large particles

28
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:40,743
of soil that are glued together.

29
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:42,304
I'm just going to remove those.

30
00:01:42,444 --> 00:01:48,904
I'm trying to get down here to the basic composition of soil here.

31
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:53,853
I'm just sieving them out, filtering them out.

32
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:57,977
That's pieces of gravel here.

33
00:01:57,977 --> 00:02:03,356
Once I have what is pretty much just the soil left,

34
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,697
these are just field soils,

35
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:09,622
just dug, I'm going to wet the sample.

36
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:12,326
I'll place just a couple drops

37
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:16,875
and the goal here is to form a ball.

38
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,274
I want to get a ball of soil

39
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:23,724
that's roughly putty-like in consistency,

40
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:26,269
something that holds together.

41
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:29,703
I'm just trying to keep wetting until we

42
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:33,569
get there. A little more soil.

43
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,479
We want a little golf ball size

44
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:42,048
so we have enough to run our diagnostic on.

45
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:47,098
I'm mixing it in my hand.

46
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:57,341
What we're going for here is we want the soil to form a ball.

47
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:04,243
This is the first part of the test,

48
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:06,384
if it will form a ball.

49
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,605
There we go. We're pretty close. Little more.

50
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:19,715
You know you're just about there when your hands are covered in dirt.

51
00:03:21,604 --> 00:03:25,134
Now reading through our flowchart,

52
00:03:25,174 --> 00:03:28,188
the first question it'll ask is,

53
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:33,938
will the sample form a ball when squeezed?

54
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:38,094
I'm going to give it a little squeeze and it retains its shape.

55
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,219
If it then wants to just shatter and fall apart,

56
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,555
following through the diagnostic we end up

57
00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:46,000
with that your sample is sand.

58
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,021
This is not just sand.

59
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,420
We move on.

60
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:56,674
Then the next part of this test is to try to form a ribbon.

61
00:03:57,276 --> 00:03:59,987
The ability of the soil sample to form

62
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:01,709
a ribbon and hold it is going

63
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,319
to be a measure of the percentage of clay.

64
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:09,645
To form a ribbon, you can take the sample

65
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:12,937
in the palm of your hand like this and you start to

66
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:17,987
squeeze and feed it out and you

67
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:24,158
want it to break naturally and fall to the table.

68
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:26,067
There it goes. You do that a couple

69
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:29,346
times and each time estimating the length.

70
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:32,937
Here we have about three-quarters of an inch.

71
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:38,899
Put it back into a ball form.

72
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:43,363
It's dried out a little bit in my hand.

73
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:46,234
Feed it a little more water.

74
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:51,049
We don't want water to be squeezed out.

75
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:57,072
I'm going back to forming a ribbon,

76
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:09,381
squeezing it out, and so this time we had about an inch.

77
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:15,769
We'll just do one more ribbon.

78
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:19,988
And we'll take the average of the three.

79
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:35,776
There it goes. It shattered when it hit,

80
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:38,076
but just under an inch.

81
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:41,845
Now following through our flowchart here,

82
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:44,285
diagram and reading, yes,

83
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:49,870
we have a ball and the ribbon formation,

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,444
we had an inch or less so we're in the loam category.

85
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,774
The next part of the test is to estimate

86
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:04,199
the percentage of grit or sand in the sample.

87
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,525
I'll take little bit of it,

88
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:14,454
put the rest aside.  About teaspoon or two

89
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:23,459
here and I'm going to wet it in the palm of my hand.

90
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:30,716
This process is intended to flatten it out.

91
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:34,425
Estimate the percentage of sand

92
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:39,130
as a factor of how gritty the soil sample feels.

93
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:42,176
The diagram asks us,

94
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,605
does the sample feel very gritty,

95
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:49,605
equally gritty and smooth, or very smooth?

96
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:57,129
Just going to give an estimation here.

97
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:03,049
It's somewhat gritty and somewhat smooth.

98
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,295
It feels somewhere in the middle.

99
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:10,019
The diagnostic has led us to the conclusion then

100
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,879
that this sample is a loam,

101
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:19,692
and so I'm going to listen to

102
00:07:19,692 --> 00:07:23,596
the sample and see if I can hear the sound of the grit rubbing.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,995
Yeah, and I can hear it just a little bit.

104
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:31,697
It's somewhere between a loam and a sandy loam then.

105
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:35,282
If we turn to the texture triangle,

106
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:38,713
we can actually then convert that diagnosis

107
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:43,118
into percentages of the various particle sizes.

108
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,064
Reading here, we have

109
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:49,639
a sandy loam being

110
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:55,086
composed of something around 20 percent clay max,

111
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:03,550
and somewhere between 70 to 50 percent sand

112
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:08,529
and a loam being as low as 30 percent sand.

113
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,707
We're probably somewhere down in

114
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:16,326
that 30 to 40 percent range below sandy loam.

115
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:18,396
Let's try the next sample.

116
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:22,586
By appearance alone, there's not really much we can tell.

117
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,222
There's no way to visually

118
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:33,773
distinguish these two soils in terms of their texture here.

119
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:36,397
But by running through this soil texture by feel,

120
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:38,253
we should be able to make some conclusions.

121
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:41,653
Let's make sure we get all the last sample off.

122
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:45,168
Again, we're going to sort the sample

123
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:49,870
a little bit, remove some roots,

124
00:08:57,065 --> 00:09:05,045
make sure it's sufficient quantity there to get

125
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:16,778
our ribbon and wetting the soil.

126
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:37,882
Little more, it's still not quite consolidating.

127
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:51,953
Little bit more. Yeah, that's

128
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:57,048
trying to form a little film on my hands so we should be there.

129
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:00,274
You don't want to oversaturate it.

130
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:03,251
Going back to our flowchart,

131
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:07,485
the first diagnostic is to see if the sample will form

132
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:08,755
a ball and here we have

133
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,426
a nice ball and under a little pressure from the finger,

134
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:13,636
it doesn't fall part,

135
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:15,576
doesn't shatter so we know we don't have

136
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:18,456
a sand sample as we suspected.

137
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:23,569
Give it a little squeeze.

138
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:29,163
Stays together, stays put so it's not a sand or a loamy sand.

139
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:32,559
We're going to move down into the next step,

140
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:39,588
which is the ribbon forming process and

141
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:46,319
get teed up in my hand and start feeding it out.

142
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:51,791
Right away I can tell that it's forming a longer ribbon.

143
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,641
This one broke when it hit,

144
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:56,395
but there we have maybe an inch and quarter.

145
00:10:56,395 --> 00:10:59,009
Run that three times.

146
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,574
I'm just going to let it naturally just feed

147
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:11,658
over my forefinger until it wants to fall.

148
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:17,471
There may be almost two inches.

149
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:20,691
Just one last sample.

150
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:31,336
Maybe

151
00:11:31,393 --> 00:11:32,802
about an inch

152
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,224
and a half average, just under that.

153
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:43,465
Reading across, we've gotten into the clay loam category.

154
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:47,345
Now we need to estimate the amount of grit in the sample.

155
00:11:47,404 --> 00:11:49,924
I'm going to take a small portion of it in the palm of

156
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,389
my hand and re-wet it in order to form a film,

157
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,200
so I get a sense of the percentage here.

158
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,730
Recalling that this relates back to

159
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:10,610
the percentages of the various particles in the texture triangle.

160
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:18,586
Already I can tell there's just some grit there certainly,

161
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:21,687
but I'm not feeling as much as

162
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:26,357
the previous sample at all and I'm listening.

163
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:30,733
There's a little bit of sound of friction,

164
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:33,933
but not a lot.

165
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:36,468
Certainly less than half

166
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:40,193
so we're more on the smooth side of this one.

167
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:45,704
Reading down somewhere between

168
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:51,289
clay loam and a silty clay loam so let's see,

169
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,209
going over here to texture triangle,

170
00:12:54,249 --> 00:12:58,810
finding a clay loam here and a silty clay loam here,

171
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:06,130
we can tell then that somewhere between 30 to 40 percent clay.

172
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:11,615
We didn't move the percentage of clay very far but it definitely

173
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:17,670
changed the characteristic qualities of the texture of the soil.

174
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,110
It becomes more smooth,

175
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:22,706
more capable of forming a longer ribbon,

176
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:24,976
with just a little bit more clay,

177
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,860
and then just that small amount of

178
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:32,392
adjustment change this soil texture for us, our diagnostic.
