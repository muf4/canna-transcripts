1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:05,490
if you really don't want to do much for

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:08,759
your lawn there's different grasses you

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,650
should pick that take less care if you

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,419
really want to invest a fair amount of

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,070
energy in your lawn then you pick

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,929
different grasses that will require a

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,490
little more mowing watering and

8
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,710
fertilizing so you have to set your

9
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:23,000
expectations and then recognize what

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,859
you're willing to do to get that long

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,689
the four main grass species that we have

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,250
Kentucky bluegrass perennial ryegrass

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,988
tall fescue and the fine fescues

14
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,390
Kentucky bluegrass is generally a higher

15
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:39,149
maintenance grass than some of the

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,299
others has a higher nitrogen requirement

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,129
and one of the disadvantages of Kentucky

18
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,919
bluegrass when you're seeding is that

19
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:50,070
it's very slow to germinate from seed

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,198
perennial ryegrass needs full Sun it

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,929
germinates quicker than any of the other

22
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,718
cool season grasses so for repairing a

23
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:00,509
bare spot perennial ryegrass if you're

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,300
in full Sun is a good choice this is the

25
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:07,019
one that's going to give you cover the

26
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:09,509
quickest tall fescue likes the Sun it

27
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:12,509
does have some moderate shade tolerance

28
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,850
one of the nice things about tall fescue

29
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,000
it is the most heat and drought tolerant

30
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:21,269
of our cool season grasses so if if you

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
don't ever plan to water your lawn or if

32
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:26,548
your lawn is in full Sun or perhaps you

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,519
have a sandy soil that doesn't retain

34
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,460
water you may want to consider tall

35
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:35,368
fescue if you've got moderate shade or

36
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,599
kind of filtered filtered shade in parts

37
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:39,180
of your lawn where you want to have

38
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,548
grass fine fescues would be the the

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,640
grass to try make sure to read the label

40
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,799
a lot of the cheap seed mixes will

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,228
include a big proportion sometimes

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,590
ninety percent of annual rye grass

43
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:54,810
rather than perennial make sure that

44
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,509
you've got perennial ryegrass and not

45
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,540
annual rye grass the other thing avoid

46
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,359
mixes where the variety is not stated

47
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,640
the work that you need to put into it to

48
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,250
see an area is the same whether you use

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,378
a good mix or a bad mix so take the time

50
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,180
and read the label and make sure that

51
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,239
you're getting the best value for your

52
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,239
dollar
