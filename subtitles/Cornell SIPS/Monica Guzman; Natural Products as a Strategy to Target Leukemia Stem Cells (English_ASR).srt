1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,000
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,879
University uh good morning and I would

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,960
like to first start by thanking aloy for

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,560
the invitation so and the opportunity to

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,278
talk to you about the work I do in the

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,960
lab today I'm going to focus on one of

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:24,320
the lines of Investigation we have in

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,719
the lab which is in natural products and

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,879
I'm really glad to say that because of

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:33,119
that meeting with the ly um when I

11
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:35,238
joined Cornell years ago um I couldn't

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,679
fight anymore and said okay we'll work

13
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:39,159
on natural products because I thought I

14
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,039
was going to stop working natural

15
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,640
products I I did some work on natural

16
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,800
products at my PhD and I'm and post do

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,759
and I'm going to mention it today but I

18
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,759
thought okay I'm that's going to be it

19
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm going to move on to better and newer

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,039
things and then I back to natural

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,640
products and and I think I'm very happy

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:03,558
that I Revisited uh that

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,478
area so so um just a brief outline of

24
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:08,679
what I'm going to discuss today so I'm

25
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,959
going to tell you about what are cancer

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:15,640
stem cells specifically what is leukemia

27
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:18,158
what are leukemia stem cells and um the

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,000
way I see what are the challenges on

29
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,439
eliminating leukemia stem cells um the

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,560
compounds uh that we're using to Target

31
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:30,239
lemia stem cells the strategies we're

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,560
using to deliver these compounds and uh

33
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,519
in animals at this point and all other

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,118
other natural

35
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:41,599
products so I would like to begin with

36
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,560
describing what cancer stem cells are

37
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,599
and to me the best analogy to think

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,320
about is plants um since we're talking

39
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,839
about plants plants is the best analogy

40
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,959
well not just plants

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,600
weeds and uh I guess you hear in Etha

42
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:59,038
are more familiar with this view Us in

43
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:01,199
New York we never see this so I like to

44
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:05,039
dream that that's what I would like to

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,080
see um so we typically see weeds in our

46
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,038
Gardens and they're annoying we want our

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,879
grass to be really green so what we

48
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:15,719
think is the best way to eliminate that

49
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:18,479
we is come with the um with the w Walker

50
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,439
is not the wood wer with the lawn mower

51
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,719
and um the wood is gone however we all

52
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,199
know if that that's not going to solve

53
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:29,159
the problem if we don't get rid of that

54
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:32,079
root that we is going to come back and

55
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,479
be there again so cancer stem cells are

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,080
pretty much the same thing are the root

57
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,199
of the disease is the root of the cancer

58
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,360
and we need to eliminate that cancer we

59
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:45,039
need to eliminate that

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,680
root so I specifically focus on leukemia

61
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,280
and in general leukemia is considered a

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,879
rare disease when it's compared to bre

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,479
prostate cancer or breast cancer it

64
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:59,199
affects around 300,000 people in the US

65
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,840
uh it is estimated that around 54,000

66
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,199
people will be diagnosed with leukemia

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,519
uh this

68
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:09,039
year and it's expected that around

69
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,680
24,000 people will die of this

70
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,479
disease so what Le what is where

71
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,319
leukemia comes from uh I would like to

72
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,119
than um what I like to think I would

73
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:21,958
like to First describe the hematopoetic

74
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,400
system so we can discuss leukemia and

75
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,719
and the blood system is highly

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,599
regenerative and to me it's highly it's

77
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,719
very fascinating because if you think

78
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:33,919
about how many cells were using every

79
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,560
single day and I put this Li just as an

80
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,639
example because every time I look at

81
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,920
this lie I go wow it doesn't matter how

82
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:44,639
many times I see it but these numbers

83
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:48,079
are real just as an example 2.4 million

84
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,559
new arthrit are made per second per

85
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,760
second as we're speaking we're just

86
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,598
making tons and tons and tons and tons

87
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:59,359
and probably exercise we making even

88
00:03:54,598 --> 00:04:02,399
more so um neutr fils as is a most

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,799
abundant white blood cell and 5 billion

90
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,280
neutr fils are produced every hour of

91
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,519
the day and if you notice also the

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,199
lifespan of these cells is very short so

93
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,360
to keep this highly uh regenerative

94
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,798
system you need a very powerful cell

95
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,959
that can maintain this every day and

96
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:23,478
this powerful cell is what we known as a

97
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:26,240
PL poent stem cell the pl poent stem

98
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:29,478
cell is a cell that can give rise to

99
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,918
both the lymphoid a lymphoid progenitor

100
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,959
and myoid

101
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:36,639
progenitor these cells has a very high

102
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,279
capacity of self renew and can give rise

103
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,319
to these progenitors that are more

104
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,478
committed to give rise to mature blood

105
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,759
cells and as they differentiate into the

106
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:49,439
hierarchy the ability to sell prew

107
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,120
decreases so you can imagine this this

108
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:56,079
has to be tightly regulated so what

109
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:59,079
happens with this regulation is um uh

110
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,599
mutated or something goes wrong you stop

111
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:03,680
making mature blood cells and what

112
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,960
happens is immature blood cells

113
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,840
accumulate in the blood and and then

114
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,399
this is what we called um or known about

115
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,079
leukemia so leukemia is an accumulation

116
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,599
of immature blood cells and these are

117
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:20,120
known as leukemic blasts they could be

118
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,560
of the myoid system or the lymphoid um

119
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,439
hierarchy so then it will be myoid

120
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,280
leukemias or lymo leukemias my

121
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,038
laboratory specifically focuses on myoid

122
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:33,198
leukemias

123
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:35,719
so what what is the origin of leukemia

124
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,000
it has been hypothesized that either a

125
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,479
hematopoetic stem cell or a hematopoetic

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,918
progenitor will have one two or more

127
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:46,199
oncogenic events that will give rise to

128
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:49,000
a leukemia stem cell this leukemia stem

129
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,360
cell also has a capacity to self-renew

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,038
and give rise to progenitors this in

131
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,280
this case leukemic progenitors which in

132
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:58,680
turn will give rise to the leukemic

133
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:01,159
blast but what I want you to think is

134
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,240
not what leukemia comes from what I want

135
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,280
you to think is how heterogeneous

136
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,240
leukemia is so in a single patient

137
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:11,198
you're going to have leukemia blast

138
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,560
leukemic progenitors and leukemic stem

139
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,598
cells and the problem becomes then when

140
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,959
you look at the outcomes of patients

141
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:22,000
with AML or acute myen of leukemia which

142
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,638
is what I would like you to focus on

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,360
because this is a big problem and that's

144
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:30,160
the reason we work in

145
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:33,439
AML so in the in the past 40 years years

146
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,439
you can see that the outcomes of AML are

147
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,759
really poor and they have not changed at

148
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,478
all uh you can see

149
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,199
1973 and

150
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,680
2002 2008 the Cs are pretty much on top

151
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,960
of each

152
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,918
other H in patients over 55 years old so

153
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,799
and the reason is not because uh the

154
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,918
therapy doesn't work is the reason is

155
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,038
because standard of care works in the

156
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:01,399
sense that most patients with AML when

157
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:04,279
they go to standard induction they will

158
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:06,679
go into remission so around 85% of

159
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,758
patients that get get

160
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,160
chemotherapy will achieve complete

161
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,520
remission the problem is that most of

162
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,160
these patients are going to relapse very

163
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,519
rapidly and then die of disease so

164
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,879
that's what the outcomes are always poor

165
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,240
and that's what the therapy has not

166
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,879
changed because there is nothing so far

167
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,720
that is better than that

168
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:31,680
85% and the reason we like to think is

169
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,599
because this again this heterogenity on

170
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,759
the cells what happens is the patient

171
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:39,878
comes with AML and then under go current

172
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,560
standard of care and we know that

173
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,720
there's disease left behind and we like

174
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,240
to call that minimal residual disease

175
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,840
and it's minimal residual disease

176
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,439
because we know it's there and in many

177
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:55,038
cases is very hard to detect unless we

178
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:57,639
can track a mutation and other um

179
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,959
features of that particular leukemia but

180
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,319
most of the cases this still a black box

181
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:05,000
but we know there's disease left behind

182
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,720
why because the patient relaxes we would

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,240
like to think that the reason that the

184
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,800
patient relaxes is because there are

185
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,720
leukemia stem cells Left Behind which

186
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,598
again has have the capacity to self

187
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:20,199
renew and give rise to disease so um my

188
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,319
focus has been to try to find and

189
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,080
identify differences between a leukemia

190
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,800
stem cell and a normal hematopoetic stem

191
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:30,120
cell in order to be able to eliminate

192
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,440
leukemia stem cells with without harming

193
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,399
normal hematop stem cells so stem cells

194
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,599
can be identified by imop phenotype and

195
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,719
I'm here putting the Min phenotype I

196
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,519
knew when I started doing this research

197
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,760
many many years ago which they were

198
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:50,200
pretty much identical they were Define a

199
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:53,679
c34 positive c38 negative HDR

200
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,399
negative so what is the clinical

201
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,199
implications so yes you tell me all

202
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,480
these very nice hypothesis but is that

203
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,040
actually clinical evidence that suggest

204
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,240
that this population is important and

205
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,599
the answer is yes there is many papers

206
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,240
that have shown that patients that have

207
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:15,278
higher proportions of c34 positive cd8

208
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,440
NE c38 negative U cells in the bone

209
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:20,240
marrow or in the peripheral blood it

210
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,079
always correlates with poor outcomes so

211
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,240
patients do wors if they have high

212
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:27,120
proportions of this population of

213
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,839
cells

214
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,039
so why would the high St of frequency

215
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,600
correlate with po

216
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,958
outcomes um I'm going to show you the

217
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,079
experiments we did to to demonstrate

218
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,799
that lemia stem cells were resistant to

219
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:44,319
chemotherapy but before um describing

220
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,439
those experiments I want to briefly

221
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,040
describe the acid just in case people

222
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,880
are not familiar with it uh which what

223
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,719
we do is take B glucemia cells we treat

224
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:56,639
them with cabin or whatever drug of

225
00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:00,160
choice we we want and we stain the cells

226
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:03,759
with an nexting and 7 a so cell that is

227
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:06,480
alive and intact U you'll have phospher

228
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:10,120
a phospho lipid in the inner lifelet of

229
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,920
the membrane of the cell and the nucleus

230
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,839
uh and the DNA in the nucleus will be

231
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,278
unaccessible because the cell is intact

232
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,839
as the cell starts undergoing apoptosis

233
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,439
what it's going to happen is the phospha

234
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,800
theal sering is going to flip to the

235
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,200
outside lifet of the cell and then an

236
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:29,319
exing can bind to that phosphat serin

237
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,200
and stay in that cell as the cell

238
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,839
continues the process of cell death then

239
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,079
the nucleus becomes available because

240
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,120
the cell becomes very permeable and then

241
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:41,439
7 ad which is a a DNA die will stay the

242
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,560
nucleus and the cell will know that the

243
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,120
cell is dead so we Mark these cells

244
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,679
which are an next negative 780 negative

245
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,560
as live

246
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:54,559
cells so what we observe when we take

247
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:56,000
total bulk AML and treat with cabin

248
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:59,078
which is the drug that is used for

249
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,639
standard of care we see that this drug

250
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:04,519
work we see more than 50% of the cells

251
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,320
are actually dying or dead so the

252
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,879
conclusion is yes this this drug is

253
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,519
actually working uh

254
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,958
however what happens is if we focus on

255
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,078
leukemia stem cell population the fin is

256
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:19,638
34 positive 38 negative population you

257
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:21,039
see these cells are intact most of the

258
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:24,480
cells are not touched with this

259
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:27,000
chemotherapy and therefore are

260
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,399
surviving so why are they're

261
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,480
surviving when we look at cells that are

262
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:35,078
more mature Define as 34 positive 38

263
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,480
positive and label them with a a

264
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:41,919
proliferation marker known as Ki 67 you

265
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,680
can see that there cells that are

266
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,919
proliferating and in in contrast when

267
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:50,519
you look at the leukemia stem cells 34

268
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:52,919
positive 38 negative cells most of them

269
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,879
are quiescent they are not proliferating

270
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:56,719
and if you think about the chemotherapy

271
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,759
when it was designed it was designed

272
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,680
under the basis that cancer cell grow

273
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,759
very

274
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,638
rapidly and that the best way to

275
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,838
eliminate this cancer was to block their

276
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,000
ability to their ability to proliferate

277
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,040
so these cells do not proliferate

278
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,639
therefore they cannot be eliminated by

279
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,759
standard of care that targets

280
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,600
proliferating

281
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,919
cells so that's nice however when we

282
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,639
compare the the quiessence of leukemia

283
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,919
stem cell that's a feature that is

284
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,839
shared with hematopoetic stem cells so

285
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,278
both of them are quiescent so we cannot

286
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,399
just pick a drug that will kill

287
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:33,639
quiescent cells because they will have

288
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,679
normal hematopoetic cells and as an

289
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,720
example I'm showing you cabin which is

290
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,719
the standard of care which is the worst

291
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,879
of all things does a pretty bad job of

292
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,920
killing lukemia stem cells and does a

293
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,838
decent job and harming normal

294
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,759
hematopoetic stem cells so it cannot

295
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,079
discriminate between these two

296
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,319
populations and there for is not a good

297
00:12:54,078 --> 00:13:00,278
drug to kemia stem

298
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,839
cells so this was how everything started

299
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:06,600
um over 10 years

300
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:08,639
ago um and now we know more Market that

301
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,240
can distinguish a leukemia stem cell

302
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,198
from a normal hematopoetic stem cell and

303
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,440
they are all labeled in green are the

304
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:18,198
markers that are found in this in

305
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,920
positive in either cell and in red are

306
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:23,719
are labeled the markers that are absent

307
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,519
in either cell so you can see there are

308
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,440
a good number of markers that can

309
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,879
distinguish a leukemia stem cell from a

310
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,800
normal hematopoetic stem cell and the

311
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,120
list will keep growing and

312
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:37,198
growing however I have to tell you the

313
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,159
disclaimer which is these will change in

314
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,479
Patient to Patient to Patient to Patient

315
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:43,159
because we are all different and

316
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,560
Leukemia stem cells are also different

317
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:48,559
between patients so the best way to

318
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:51,679
define a leukemia stem cell will be by

319
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:54,078
function so what we do in the lab is

320
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,879
perform functional assay which means it

321
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,679
evaluates the ability of a leukemia stem

322
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,120
cell or a or a progenitor cell

323
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,758
to give rise to

324
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,519
progeny so one of these assays is the

325
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,680
colon forming assay the colon forming

326
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,159
aay what it does it measures the ability

327
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:14,159
of a progenitor stem cell to give rise

328
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,958
to progeny in the case of hematopoetic

329
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,278
cells what we see will be normal

330
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,159
colonies and in the case of the leukemic

331
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:22,799
cell we'll see leukemic

332
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,120
colonies and the gold standard assay is

333
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:28,000
what we know as the cenot transplant aay

334
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,959
which will measure stem Cel activity in

335
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
the case of um hematopoetic cells if we

336
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:37,319
inject them in an immuno deficient mice

337
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,519
we will see normal hematopoesis normal

338
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,800
human hematopoesis in the mouth and in

339
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:46,159
the case of leukemia what we will see is

340
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:48,599
Leukemia in this mouth but the best way

341
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,278
to prove that is indeed a cell that has

342
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,720
the ability to self-renew you have to do

343
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,159
serial transplantation so then you

344
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,800
should be able to propagate the disease

345
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,360
again and again and again and again and

346
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,879
again forever and ever if you have a

347
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,320
stem

348
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,480
cell so um these are the assays that we

349
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,519
use in the

350
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,159
lab so based on that uh then the next

351
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,639
thing is can we find molecular features

352
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:18,000
that can identify a lemia stem cell from

353
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,278
a normal hematopoetic stem cell and take

354
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,879
advantage of that feature to fill the

355
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:26,399
cell so we found that feature and that

356
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:29,480
feature is NF capab NF capab is a

357
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,879
transcription factor that is involved

358
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,440
in growth and survival responses in

359
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:37,399
tumors and the way it works is in a

360
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,319
normal cell NF capab will be find

361
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,240
inactive in the cytoplasm of the cell

362
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:44,559
and it can maintain be it can be

363
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,039
maintained inactive by its inhibitor

364
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:50,838
called IA B Alpha Upon A stimuli that

365
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:53,198
could be many different types of stimula

366
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:57,319
like um infection for example in the

367
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:59,679
case of normal cells uh NF Capa IAB B

368
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:01,278
Alpha will get phosphorilated and then

369
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,519
degraded by the

370
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:06,799
proteosome leing an Capa free to go to

371
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,560
the nucleus and start the transcription

372
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,240
of genes involving survival

373
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,039
proliferation and

374
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,278
inflammation so that's what NF capab

375
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:18,719
does so what we found was that in

376
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:21,958
leukemic stem cells NF capab was

377
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,800
constitutively activated in the nucleus

378
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:29,039
shown here by a uh DNA binding acid and

379
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:31,758
in contrast normal hematopoetic cells

380
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:34,480
did not have NF capab constitut the

381
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,639
active when we found this first uh we

382
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,199
were not surprised that NF capab was

383
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,919
constitutively active in in AML because

384
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,758
it already had been reported to be

385
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,479
critical for the survival and

386
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:48,759
proliferation of tumors many other

387
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,720
tumors but what actually surprised me

388
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:54,680
was when we look at the very primitive

389
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,519
quiescent stem cells NF capab was also

390
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:59,479
constitutively active so these cells are

391
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:02,440
quiescent are resting but yet they have

392
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,439
this transcription Factor constitutively

393
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,919
on so that led us to think and

394
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,038
hypothesize uh can we use this unique

395
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:13,559
characteristic to eliminate leukemia

396
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:16,160
stem cells can we target NF capab to

397
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:18,798
selectively eliminate leukemia stem

398
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,360
cells without harming normal hoptic stem

399
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:25,240
cells so to do this we turn to

400
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:28,318
plants and we use this compound called

401
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,720
perano which is derived from a a plant

402
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,480
known as fever

403
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,440
Fu and it's called fever Fu because it

404
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,440
has been used for many years to decrease

405
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:41,558
fevers as its name uh says and but it

406
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,080
has other uh medicinal uses such as um

407
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,879
relieve migraines endotoxic shock and

408
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,319
stomach eggs arthritis asthma skin

409
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,320
rashes tumors insect repellent and so

410
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:56,000
forth and so on there are many uses

411
00:17:51,319 --> 00:18:00,000
which fever F has been listed for in

412
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,240
ethnobotany chemically is a c

413
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,720
and it was well known to be a potent

414
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,240
inhibitor of

415
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,360
NCA by now with all the research we've

416
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,079
done and other groups we know that uh

417
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,279
parite also depletes stle and has many

418
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:16,240
other targets but at the time it was

419
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,079
listed as a very poent NF cap inhibitor

420
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,880
so we tried

421
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:25,839
it what we found is when we use n pareno

422
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,400
in leukemia stem cells shown in here we

423
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,599
saw that most of the the the leukemia

424
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,000
cells from different AML patients each

425
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:35,599
line represents an AML patient sample

426
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,880
these leukemia stem cells were

427
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,599
eliminated with a concentration of five

428
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,200
micro of

429
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,519
pareno in contrast when we look at

430
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,038
normal hematopoetic stem cells you can

431
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,960
see these cells at five microl

432
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:52,480
concentration were not affected by this

433
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,798
compound so this demonstrated that

434
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,279
peroly can very effectively eliminate

435
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,599
leukemia stem cells not harming uh

436
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,038
normal hematop stem cells but this is

437
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,199
just based by phenotype we also

438
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,960
corroborated this uh

439
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,720
using sorry the functional assays that I

440
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,200
mentioned to you which first we did The

441
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,558
Colony forming assays and you can see

442
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,159
that treatment with pareno decreased

443
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:19,079
very significantly the ability of uh

444
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,200
leukemia cells to give rise to colonies

445
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,199
but did not affect the ability of a

446
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,080
normal hematopoetic stem cells to give

447
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,519
rise to normal red blood cell colonies

448
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,599
and a white blood cell colonies

449
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,319
and more importantly when we treated the

450
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,480
cells with parthenolide and then

451
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:37,279
transplanted them into imuno deficient

452
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,960
mice to assess the function of these

453
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,519
cells we found that treatment with

454
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,558
paroli eliminated the ability of these

455
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,359
leukemia stem cells to give rise to

456
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,720
leukemia but it not affected the ability

457
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:53,000
of normal hematopoetic stem cells to

458
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:56,000
give rise to normal hematopoesis so this

459
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,440
demonstrated that indeed pareno was a

460
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,079
very poent inhibitor of um

461
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,759
of leukemia stem cell

462
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,079
function we needed to corroborate that

463
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,359
the reason that perite work was because

464
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:12,240
our hypothesis we wanted to corroborate

465
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:15,119
that we're indeed inhibiting NF

466
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,319
capab so the way we I'm going to show it

467
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,798
to you is using inun floresent which in

468
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,480
a leukemia stem cell n capab will be

469
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,960
active in the nucleus and in this case

470
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,120
will be staying with yellow so you'll

471
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,120
see it in the nucleus and we expect that

472
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:32,038
if we inhibit paral life an capu go back

473
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,798
to the cytoplasm where it belongs so

474
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:37,038
what we found is indeed the treatment

475
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:39,759
with perano inhibited effectively n

476
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:42,200
capab in these leukemia cells and the

477
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,640
other feature that paroli did was a very

478
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,440
potent induction of reactive oxygen

479
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,440
species in this case measured with a

480
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,640
transcription Factor known as Nrf2 Nrf2

481
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,840
in a control cell will be found in the

482
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,440
cytoplasm but if it if this R signal

483
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,879
gets activated it will go to the nucleus

484
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,840
and and then will activate transcription

485
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,679
and indeed perol resulted in activation

486
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:09,278
of Nrf2 demonstrated that it's inducing

487
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,159
reactive oxy

488
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:14,319
species so everything is very nice and

489
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,880
beautiful and we found something that

490
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:22,798
can kill leukemia St cell but of course

491
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,000
paroly cannot be used in humans as it is

492
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,038
why

493
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,119
because it has very poor solubility and

494
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,640
bioavailability

495
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,639
uh in animal studies when parol was used

496
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,759
at 40 milligram per kilogram which is

497
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,640
the maximum amount you can solubilize

498
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,839
this

499
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,759
compound um very low amount was detected

500
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:45,278
in the plasma of this mice which was 200

501
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,558
nanom so if you remember I told you we

502
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:50,119
need at least five micro to kill

503
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:53,480
leukemia so this amount will not be

504
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:56,079
useful to treat animals or

505
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,038
people so for those reason we started

506
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:03,240
collaborating with Dr Peter krooks

507
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:06,480
to make medicinal analog to

508
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,038
paralite and uh what we found was the

509
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,038
map which is a soluble analog of paroli

510
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:14,960
and I just point out here the timeline

511
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:17,200
so it it takes a long time to go through

512
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,440
all this process to make a medicinal

513
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,240
analog and take it to phase one clinical

514
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,000
trials so the map is right now in

515
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,519
clinical trials and we're expecting to

516
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,519
see what happened with this compound um

517
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,639
to see if it actually would kill human

518
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:35,759
stem cells in

519
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,159
patients but I since since I'm in Etha I

520
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:41,679
would like to talk about the studies we

521
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,360
did in dogs um because I um I think this

522
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,559
is very interesting and very cool and

523
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:50,639
and I think you guys will appreciate it

524
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:53,119
more um than other people so we use

525
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,960
canine leukemias and I have to point out

526
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:59,000
that this is not a leukemia stem cell

527
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,319
model uh these were advanced containing

528
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,839
cd34 positive

529
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:06,200
leukemias and at the time that we

530
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,759
started this collaboration which we

531
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,080
sorry was a collaboration that was

532
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,759
established um by chance so what

533
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,319
happened is we published the paper with

534
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,640
paranoide we received a phone call of

535
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:22,000
AET and said hey would can we use your

536
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,559
compounding dogs dogs have AML and they

537
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,919
di very rapidly of AML there's nothing

538
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:29,399
for them can we try it so we thought

539
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,200
that would be cool but we don't know

540
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,559
anything about dog leukemias we don't

541
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,759
even know if an if capab would be active

542
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:38,960
in dog leukemias so the very first thing

543
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:42,240
we did is tested ffab was constitutively

544
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,480
active in leukemias of dogs and the

545
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,278
answer was yes so we did checked and

546
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,480
then the second thing well would

547
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:53,599
paranoide work in this dog leukemia in

548
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,599
vitro and the answer was yes we also

549
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,918
tested normal bone marrow from dogs

550
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:01,399
healthy dogs and we found that par pite

551
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:05,240
was not harmful to normal hematopoesis

552
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,440
of dogs so with that in hand we said

553
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,919
okay let's do it let's try it and we

554
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,080
tested in three dogs so the end is very

555
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,840
small but I thought the results would

556
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,278
really big and change how we saw perite

557
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:19,199
for clinical

558
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:21,079
trials so we three dogs with Advanced

559
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,919
c34 positive

560
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:25,519
leukemias we treated them with the m

561
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,360
different doses different schedules

562
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,319
because that dose and schedule was

563
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,278
dependent on

564
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:35,879
the the the I guess the dog the size of

565
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:37,919
the dog and how far the the bed Clinic

566
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:43,120
was and and

567
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:46,520
also we we knew um we knew all the

568
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,558
pharmacology of uh the map in dogs

569
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:51,240
because that was a study that was done

570
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:53,960
to take the the drug to clinical trials

571
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,359
so we knew that a dose of 100 Mig per

572
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,159
kilogram was the maximum tolerated dose

573
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:01,278
for the dog so in even in that sense we

574
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,320
were lucky we had that

575
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:07,000
information so so we took different time

576
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,398
forms we collected peripheral blot we

577
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,720
check the white L cell counts we look at

578
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:14,038
c34 because was the only marker that we

579
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,640
knew and there are very few markers

580
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:17,558
available for closy ometry to look at

581
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,000
dog

582
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:22,519
cells and then we also look at our

583
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,240
biological markers of course NF capab

584
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:28,440
and in this case to measure reactive

585
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,038
oxygen species or stress we use gamma H2

586
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,880
and mainly because it cross reactors

587
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:33,960
with

588
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,559
dog so uh what we

589
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,240
saw is first we saw an increase this is

590
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:42,798
an example of one of the dogs we saw a

591
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,120
very marked increase on white blood cell

592
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:48,079
counts after the treatment with the m 50

593
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:51,079
Mig per

594
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:54,000
kilogram what we saw too was a decrease

595
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:57,278
in the expression of cd34 positive in

596
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,720
these leukemia cells so this data was

597
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,919
suggesting to us that the leukemia cells

598
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,038
were

599
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,520
differentiating potentially into normal

600
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:09,640
white blood cells before they they they

601
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:12,038
die and what we observed was indeed the

602
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,200
MP was causing differentiation of

603
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:18,000
leukemic cells in

604
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,720
Vio and of course it was inhibiting NF

605
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,038
cap in

606
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:26,839
Vio so um these pieces of evidence

607
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:29,519
confirmed that indeed parol in cap but

608
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:32,038
the surprise to us was was that in Vio

609
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,839
in dock dmap was inducing

610
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:36,359
differentiation rather than just

611
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:39,839
immediate s dead as we saw in

612
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:42,359
vitro this was a major change for how we

613
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,199
Dr the clinical trial because then we we

614
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:46,558
thought you know maybe it's a good idea

615
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,278
to First decrease the white L cell C of

616
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,918
the patient because you don't want to

617
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:55,240
have um tumor liis syndrome in people we

618
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:59,520
did observe tumor license syndrome in

619
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:01,278
one of the dogs so this was a very lucky

620
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,759
I think for us to be able to feed these

621
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:06,720
animals and be able what happens when

622
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,079
you have uh a spontaneous lemia where

623
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,679
you have dog leukemia in dog micro

624
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,759
environment which we don't see of course

625
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,840
in the Cog grabs that that's the part

626
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,679
we're missing when we treat xenographs

627
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,599
because you have human cells in Mouse

628
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,200
micro environment which is not the same

629
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:24,519
as you see

630
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,679
people but you might want to want you

631
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:28,879
might wonder what happened with the

632
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,600
leukemia stem cells this was a shot we

633
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,200
took in the dark because we don't even

634
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:36,398
know if the animal if we could do

635
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,120
xenographs of dogs so we said well let's

636
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:41,479
just try it the wor that can happen is

637
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:44,158
that nothing happens so what we did is

638
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,839
took cells from day Zero of treatment of

639
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:51,440
this dog and then day 12 after treatment

640
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:54,398
of the dog we we transplanted the cells

641
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,640
equal cell number of leukemia cells in

642
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:59,158
the mouse at Day Zero and in the mouse

643
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,200
at from day

644
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:04,240
12 and we measured the ability of these

645
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,919
cells to give rise to leukemia in this

646
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,440
mice and what we found was a significant

647
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:11,240
decrease in the ability of these

648
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,960
leukemia cells to give rise to leukemia

649
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,960
in the mouse what we did next is do

650
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,600
seral transplantation like I told you

651
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,480
the stem cell will be able to

652
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,278
recapitulate disease forever and ever

653
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,558
and ever and what we observe is when we

654
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:28,480
serially transplanted these cells again

655
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:31,599
equal cell numbers for dog cells for

656
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,480
this mice we saw a significant decrease

657
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,879
that the significant decrease was even

658
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,079
stronger when uh the cells were serly

659
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,519
transplanted this data strongly

660
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:44,519
suggested that paroly was indeed

661
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,359
targeting leukemia stem cells uh in

662
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,359
these

663
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:54,479
animals so um so that that was great and

664
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,918
now we're just waiting to see what

665
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,558
happens with the clinical trials with

666
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:02,519
people and uh and is still undergoing

667
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,639
but we expect to see similar

668
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,278
observations and the end points that

669
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,720
we're going to take are going to be very

670
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:12,159
similar to what we did in the

671
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,960
dogs but this always very nice but we're

672
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,240
still trying to think if there is better

673
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,159
ways to take these compounds that are

674
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,278
not soluble that have very poor

675
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,278
pharmacological properties if there is a

676
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:26,720
way to take them faster to the clinic

677
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:30,480
and closer to where leukemia stem cells

678
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,519
reside so leukemia stem cells live in

679
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,919
the bone marrow and they like to hide on

680
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:39,399
top of being chemor resistant and quent

681
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,240
they also like to

682
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:46,119
hide they like to hide in the industrial

683
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,960
region of the micro of the of the B Maro

684
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,959
where they're also further protected

685
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,919
from chemotherapeutic

686
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,880
drugs so what we thought is why we don't

687
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:58,278
take uh paranoide as a proof of

688
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,840
principle and use nanop particles to

689
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:05,480
take parol to the bone

690
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:09,038
marrow so we took parol uh we U this was

691
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:12,440
in collaboration with hien he is in

692
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:15,000
Houston uh we took this the parol we put

693
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,278
it in mles this Mel are covered with

694
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,720
silicone

695
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:22,480
particles and then these particles are

696
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,519
covered with e selecting tho the E

697
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,159
selecting

698
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:30,000
theep will guide this nanop particle all

699
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,240
the way to region of the bone marrow as

700
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,960
it will like find is

701
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,558
selecting and then very slowly they

702
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,000
deliver the drug in that area where

703
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:44,798
leukemia stem cells

704
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,319
reside so before telling you about um

705
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:50,359
what happened I want to compare and

706
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:52,839
contrast how we use the nanop particles

707
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:54,599
with how we use the soluable compound I

708
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:58,879
tell you about the

709
00:30:54,599 --> 00:31:02,199
DMT so in mice they have life of D mapts

710
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,880
only 30 minutes and the those that we

711
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,639
thought we had to use to achieve the

712
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,480
five microl concentration is 100 mgram

713
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:14,879
per kilogram so we need to give it three

714
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:18,159
times a day oral Gage every single day

715
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,720
and just so you get an idea each syringe

716
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,720
represents a dose so I was a post dog

717
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,839
when I was doing this I cannot I can

718
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,278
tell you that was not fun for me or for

719
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:33,319
the mice nobody was having fun

720
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:35,000
um but um the worst part and I'm not

721
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:37,960
going to show it here is in another

722
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,960
paper we already publish the dmap in

723
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,600
mice by itself cannot eliminate tumor

724
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,399
burden you need to combine it with

725
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,798
another drug and we think is because

726
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:49,119
probably the mice produce more

727
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,679
gluathione and then prevent the activity

728
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,158
of the drug to get to the lemic cells so

729
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,880
if you combine with an anti with with uh

730
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:00,559
EMP inh with empor Inhibitors you can

731
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,480
potentiate activity of the map in Bol to

732
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:05,359
kill leukemia in mice I also show you it

733
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,480
works in Ducks without any other stuff

734
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,038
so I think again the biology of each

735
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:13,360
species is going to be very

736
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:16,038
important but what was very cool about

737
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:19,359
the nanop particles is because they are

738
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:23,638
very slow release we can deliver them

739
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:26,240
once every two weeks uh via tail pan and

740
00:32:23,638 --> 00:32:29,879
also we loaded as much as we can load of

741
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,240
pereno into that cell which will

742
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,519
represent approximately assuming that

743
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:39,440
all the perite made it in the animal

744
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:42,000
will be 2.5 millgram per kilogram uh per

745
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,000
Mouse so you can see it's a huge

746
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,038
difference in

747
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
dosing so what we found is that in the

748
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,759
nanop particle paroli was very potent at

749
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,880
eliminating total tumor burden when

750
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:58,558
compared with the mys uh with peroli or

751
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,159
with the empty nanop

752
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:04,638
particles we also found that was very

753
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:07,159
potently inhibiting NF Capa B in

754
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:09,319
the and the thing that I found really

755
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:12,399
interesting is when we measure

756
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:14,798
parthenolide either in the plasma or in

757
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,879
the bones of this mice 1 hour after

758
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:19,519
bolo's treatment with these nanop

759
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,720
particles we found that there was

760
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,000
nothing in the plasma and everything was

761
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,519
in the bones just in one hour after

762
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,159
injecting these nanop particles

763
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:30,200
suggesting that this nanopar particles

764
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,000
were very effective at bringing perol

765
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,080
life to the

766
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,079
bones we also did the serial

767
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,798
transplantation to demonstrate that we

768
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:41,319
actually still killing leukemia stem

769
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:44,119
cells and we saw these are two PDX

770
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:47,240
meaning two primary AML samples injected

771
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:48,678
into the mice we show that the in serial

772
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,720
transplantation will decrease the

773
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:52,639
ability of leukemia stem cells to give

774
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,038
rise to

775
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:59,079
disease so uh because all of these part

776
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:01,679
because of the Great it of paroli

777
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:03,278
because we find it from natural products

778
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,759
we thought that it would be very

779
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,398
important to start a collaboration with

780
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,800
people that know about plants that know

781
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:12,519
about chemical um the chemical

782
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,800
structures they know about spin lactones

783
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:16,559
so we started a collaboration with the

784
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,359
New York Botanical

785
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:21,519
Gardens with Cornell here with uh Dr

786
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,078
Eloy Rodriguez and with the uh

787
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:27,119
University of Arkansas and this

788
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,480
collaboration consists in finding plants

789
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,159
that are related

790
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,878
to ffu to find better squint lactones

791
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,838
that will have similar activity to perol

792
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:41,118
light uh that we can take to the clinic

793
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:43,078
hopefully in a rapid Manner and

794
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,679
understand better what are the critical

795
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,720
activities of this type of

796
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,960
compounds so I hope to we can have more

797
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,358
updates uh soon but this project is

798
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,599
advancing

799
00:34:52,358 --> 00:35:00,639
ridly so just to switch years after we

800
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,559
talked all about um cquin lacton and and

801
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:05,078
paranoide I would like to briefly

802
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,400
mention the work of cranberries and the

803
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,800
reason I want to talk about cranberries

804
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,440
is because this work started from a PhD

805
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,039
student that came from um this school

806
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,679
well now she's supposed to talk in New

807
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:18,800
York but she did her PhD here at Cornell

808
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:21,519
her name is Lori uh

809
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,519
vrom and she loves cranberries it's her

810
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:27,039
passion everything she does leaves and

811
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:30,199
things is cranberries and uh because uh

812
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:32,400
Dr rodri is uh it's true she Rings

813
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:35,960
everything with cranberries I'm not

814
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,519
exaggerating um so

815
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,880
um and we're all learning to love

816
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:44,199
cranberries too so uh she she came to my

817
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,640
lab because Dr Rodriguez mentioned her

818
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:50,159
uh my name and she wanted to test her

819
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:54,199
extracts in cancers so I agreed to be

820
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:56,719
her mentor and uh she had cranberries I

821
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:58,719
had leukemic cells and we said let's try

822
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:01,519
it it's a a perfect

823
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:03,078
combination and uh cranberries as you

824
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:04,719
all know they are well known because

825
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,039
they are used for urinary tract

826
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:11,480
infections and also can stimulate immune

827
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:14,880
system so what we did first is try total

828
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,639
cranberry extract in different uh

829
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,640
leukemia cell lines and this is just an

830
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,598
example of all the leukemia cell lines

831
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:24,440
we tested and you can see that the

832
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:28,160
cranberry extracts are very potent and

833
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:30,559
at causing cell death in leukemia cells

834
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,159
there is a threshold like a lower

835
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,440
concentration that you can see some

836
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:37,639
cells are more sensitive than other

837
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,358
leukemic cells around here but the

838
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:43,118
higher you go in the concentration it

839
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:46,639
seems to work on a leukemia

840
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,720
cells uh we also pu well Lori also

841
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,759
purified the active one of the active

842
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:54,439
compounds of The Cranberries known as

843
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,200
apacks which are formed from different

844
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,240
multim multimar is not purifi it's not a

845
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:02,039
purif compound is a mixture of dimer

846
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,679
drers teters and

847
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:07,119
pentamers and we have also found that

848
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:09,919
individual um components are not

849
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,680
sufficient to kill the leukemia cells so

850
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,000
this mixture we use at lower

851
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:16,960
concentrations in primary samples and

852
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,838
did the colony assays and you can see

853
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,400
that uh at 62.5 micrograms per

854
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:25,039
milliliter we can see that leukemia

855
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,519
progenitor cell activity is decreased

856
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,440
and normal activity of H biotic cells is

857
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:33,119
not

858
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,159
affected uh we have also done the U the

859
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,280
stem cell we discuss and we see

860
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:39,399
selectivity against leukemia stem cells

861
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,760
not normal hematop stem

862
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,480
cells and because um we wanted to see if

863
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,280
she can because she really really wanted

864
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,838
to try it in Vio so I said well let's

865
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:52,800
try it so we set up some cographs we

866
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:55,639
transplanted primary patient samples in

867
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,240
the mouse we established the cograph the

868
00:37:55,639 --> 00:38:02,118
cograph the animal had leukemia

869
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:06,759
uh she treated either with PBS sarin or

870
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:09,599
apx at 25 Mig per kilogram 2 a week

871
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:13,040
three uh for three weeks and what we

872
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,599
found is that apacks were really uh

873
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,920
poent at eliminating a two more celling

874
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,000
rment almost at the same level as RSC so

875
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,960
this is the standard of care 60 migs per

876
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,679
kilogram which is very toxic to the mice

877
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:31,240
as in contrast 25 Mig per kilogram which

878
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:33,919
it was not toxic uh to the animals so

879
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:35,479
this suggest that these uh cranberry

880
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,200
extracts could be

881
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,800
used uh in um in Vivo to Kure leukemia

882
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:44,919
and hopefully leukemia stem cells the

883
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,560
secondary transplants are under way so

884
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,680
hopefully we can also show what kills

885
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,759
leukemia stem

886
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:54,279
cells so just to summarize uh what we

887
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,200
discuss today is that compounds derived

888
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,400
from medicinal plants uh such as perol

889
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,078
and granberry extracts can be used to

890
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,480
Target leukemia stem

891
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,079
cells also that nanop particles

892
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,240
represent that strategy to deliver

893
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,079
compounds uh with put pharmacological

894
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:13,959
properties into mice um and potentially

895
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,119
also to humans and that other natural

896
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:19,240
products are currently being studied to

897
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:21,200
Target leukemia stem cells in general

898
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:24,358
what we're doing in the lab is trying to

899
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:27,759
get uh AML samples uh characterize them

900
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:29,960
well from Patient to Patient do hro put

901
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,520
assays to evaluate the ability of

902
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,838
compounds to kill uh leukemia stem cells

903
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:38,960
using functional assays and also develop

904
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,318
uh biomarkers so we can uh match a drug

905
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,358
with a

906
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:45,920
patient and also from the bedside to the

907
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:49,078
bench when we start the clinical trials

908
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,920
we like to save samples characterize

909
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:54,400
them well Bank One marrow peripheral

910
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,079
blood plasma so we can do biological

911
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,760
assays to determine if we're targeting

912
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,720
leukemia stem cells in the patients and

913
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,079
also test the biomarkers to make sure

914
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,598
that the drug is doing what it's

915
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,960
supposed to

916
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,280
do and just finally I need to thank the

917
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,559
people that have been working so hard on

918
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,599
these

919
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,239
project first I want to thank my

920
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,318
collaborators and the clinical side

921
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,799
especially Dr G Robos uh who is the

922
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:22,920
director of the leukemia program at

923
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,640
Corell uh Dr Michael bik is our

924
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,599
collaborator at the New York Botanical

925
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,118
Gardens and he's been getting us a lot

926
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:30,200
of plants

927
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:32,920
uh Michael Becker at the University of

928
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:35,719
Rochester he he provides us uh also

929
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,639
leukemia leukemia cells Peter Crooks and

930
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:42,358
Cesar Compadre work on the modification

931
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:44,519
of compounds and the purification of um

932
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:47,960
the compounds from

933
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:49,800
Plants uh this is my lab in the summer

934
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,519
it looks busy in the summer we get a lot

935
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,839
of people students high schoolers and

936
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:58,159
undergrad but it's a lot of fun and

937
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:02,838
these are the team so this

938
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:05,399
Lori uh Sabrina and Bernardo were the

939
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:07,599
pack Grand team meaning they work with

940
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,920
ap packs and cranberries and they named

941
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,599
themselves pack Grand and they held

942
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,920
their logo which was a little Pac-Mans

943
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,440
ship like Pac-Mans ship cranberry eating

944
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,079
Lans

945
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:23,079
themselves so and then is H Gabby Rachel

946
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:26,000
she's actually student here from from

947
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:28,760
corala uh B is from

948
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:34,599
Ecuador Mar

949
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:36,599
and uh yes let me see one person and

950
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:38,599
Gabby but she's not in this picture they

951
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,318
are from the weeds team they couldn't

952
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:43,280
come up with a better name but that

953
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:46,279
means that they focus on the plants like

954
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,200
FF and all other um medicinal plants

955
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,599
we're getting from uh the newor

956
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:53,078
Botanical Gardens and this is the

957
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:55,240
funding that of course without funding I

958
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:57,800
would be doing nothing uh but just

959
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:00,399
thinking about it um and thank you to

960
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,400
you for your

961
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,040
attention have you got any uh like gene

962
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,800
expression or anything with the cells to

963
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:16,639
see if anything besides NF Cap B is

964
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:19,880
affected with the with parol we did so

965
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:21,639
and we found many other parol like

966
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,519
compounds using the Gen expression

967
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:26,358
signature of

968
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:28,759
Leukemia and uh the strongest signature

969
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:31,679
is inhibition of NF

970
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:35,920
cap and activation of reactive oxygen

971
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:38,960
species uh We've also done modifications

972
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,680
of paranoide with biotin so we can pull

973
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,599
down its targets so when we did that we

974
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:46,558
found that paranoide has other targets

975
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:48,800
that are involving metabolism and that

976
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,599
was reported by my previous Mentor CH

977
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,359
Jordan and other people have also found

978
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,680
that can also affect epigenetic

979
00:42:53,358 --> 00:43:00,519
Machinery so in general uh per light

980
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:03,558
will bind to any protein that will have

981
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:08,119
a preyin or any th group that is

982
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:10,000
available um so it is not just an NK

983
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:14,079
inhibitor we use it because of that

984
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,079
feature but it causes many more

985
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:21,799
things yes what is the mechanism for the

986
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:24,240
nanop particles to move the the paral wi

987
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:28,599
into the right place

988
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:31,078
where so it is it is label on the

989
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:33,760
surface of the nanoparticle with an E

990
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:38,880
selecting thomer so it's a very tiny

991
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:42,240
peptide that can buy etin so etin is

992
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,920
expressed in the endothelium and is

993
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,639
found in very high amounts in

994
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,680
endothelium of the bone marrow so that's

995
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,519
how it it's guided there so it's really

996
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:53,279
cool but it's very expensive so we're

997
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:56,559
trying to find other ways to take them

998
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,559
right there

999
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:08,358
so the DPT studies um in the K9 model

1000
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:10,160
then induces diff differentiation so in

1001
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:12,039
in AML then of course I mean

1002
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,759
differentiation induction therapy has

1003
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:18,079
been remarkably ineffective so those are

1004
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:21,640
really exciting results and I was

1005
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,480
wondering if you've tried or if anyone

1006
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:27,199
has tried to look at you know how the

1007
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,960
DPT works in the K9 model it doesn't

1008
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:33,879
presume work in in in the human

1009
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:37,079
primaries yet uh no I mean that would be

1010
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,440
very nice but at the time you know all

1011
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:42,119
everything happened so fast like really

1012
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:46,480
so fast that uh the amount of cells we

1013
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:48,559
had it was not a lot but I mean thinking

1014
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,599
back yes we even discussed this at some

1015
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,880
point with with Greg it would be nice if

1016
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:54,440
we had cells left over to see what

1017
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,680
happened to those cells what is the

1018
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,559
signature in the dog cells but first of

1019
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:02,799
all we had no experience with dogs we

1020
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:06,079
don't know anything about dogs we were

1021
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,039
just working with the with these three

1022
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,559
animals so I think uh just I was talking

1023
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,440
to Christie yesterday I think it's a

1024
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,960
great opportunity to work and uh with

1025
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,358
dogs and try to understand more about

1026
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,240
the biology of these compounds in a

1027
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:24,239
system where um hopefully we'll be more

1028
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:27,639
similar to humans hopefully maybe um a

1029
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:29,919
discloser than mice and xenographs um

1030
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:31,799
is it an ahr

1031
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,880
liend I don't

1032
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:38,039
know I don't

1033
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:41,480
know might be interesting to know if it

1034
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:44,440
can potentiate say retinoic

1035
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:48,280
acid yeah and the thing is because we

1036
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:50,720
saw this effect in dogs not in mice so

1037
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:54,599
even in the mice when we combine with

1038
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:57,159
the enter inhibitor and we saw very uh a

1039
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:00,359
significant Synergy in the mice in the

1040
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:04,118
gra we never saw differentiation of

1041
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:06,159
cells in the mice so so the system

1042
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:08,079
probably is also important to consider

1043
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:11,558
and we've never went back to those

1044
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,559
studies uh in

1045
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,079
dogs yes so you mentioned that um

1046
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,280
different patients have a different

1047
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:24,720
subset of um phenotypic Market does that

1048
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:26,200
change with um treatment with pereno or

1049
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:28,239
is that kind of stable have you looked

1050
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:30,558
at that so that's a very good question

1051
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:33,000
for any chemotherapy so we really don't

1052
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:35,880
know and part of the efforts to try to

1053
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,838
evaluate minimal residual disease in

1054
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,440
involes flowetry because if you think

1055
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:43,960
about tracking a population we need to

1056
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,920
know how this population behaves and we

1057
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,280
cannot assume that the markers are not

1058
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,639
going to change my personal point of

1059
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,839
view I like to see uh the phenotypic

1060
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:57,558
markers as your dress as your coat you

1061
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:59,558
decide to wear something today maybe

1062
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:02,359
because your gen expression told you to

1063
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:04,440
but it doesn't mean that after you get

1064
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:06,679
exposed to some very aggressive

1065
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,519
chemotherapy and you want to hide from

1066
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:11,719
this therapy maybe your dress also going

1067
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:14,480
to change uh so that's something we want

1068
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:16,959
to understand and we have very strong

1069
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,280
efforts following and understanding

1070
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,159
minimal perit of disease after any

1071
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,359
chemotherapy because probably is going

1072
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:25,199
to be different from Patient to Patient

1073
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,358
and from therapy to therapy but if we

1074
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:29,719
can tell what is

1075
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:31,920
normal then would be a way to track

1076
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:31,919
those

1077
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,400
cells my com on LA on in a review that I

1078
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:42,880
did quite a while back uh there were

1079
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:45,599
almost almost 2,000 of them know quite

1080
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,920
diverse in primarily in the aster

1081
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:51,838
sunflower family and with one of them

1082
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,318
they just gave a Nobel Prize

1083
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:57,400
fortiv malaria the point being that

1084
00:47:54,318 --> 00:48:00,279
these lactones are

1085
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:03,119
we really don't understand how they go

1086
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,359
about it but there are certain bar force

1087
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,720
on the molecule that make that we can

1088
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:11,679
attach to proteins but uh we're still

1089
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:14,439
very far from really understanding

1090
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:16,078
mechanistic uh action on this compound

1091
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,760
so they're right they're open to an

1092
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,440
incredible kind of diversity and I and I

1093
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,440
like what you've done because this is

1094
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:26,800
what we have to do with I think say for

1095
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:29,679
any kind of any natural product that we

1096
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,559
trying to push and and utilize it that

1097
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:37,759
you know as a as a pharmaceutical you

1098
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:40,000
need really good rigorous uh essays

1099
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,599
which unfortunately we don't do with a

1100
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,719
lot of natural products and I think that

1101
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:48,359
part the negative feelings toward

1102
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:48,358
natural products as

1103
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:54,159
potential yeah so that's I mean that's

1104
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,838
the goal of the big collaboration with

1105
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:59,598
uh all this multidisciplinary team which

1106
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:01,000
we said together because uh also I mean

1107
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,480
I didn't mention it but when I was a

1108
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,318
post dog I tried many different cquin

1109
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,119
tropin lactones just because we said oh

1110
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:09,960
let's try uh anything that we saw that

1111
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:12,119
looked like parite and all of the

1112
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,838
activities were very different and when

1113
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,880
we were screening the the the medicinal

1114
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:19,279
analoges they all behave differently so

1115
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,519
the idea is to try to find the most

1116
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,519
potent cquin lacton that are still

1117
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:26,798
selective and try to understand where

1118
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:28,440
the selectivity comes from because

1119
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:30,079
probably the targets are not going to be

1120
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,079
the same and maybe we will be able to

1121
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:35,880
tell okay she has to be NF capab and

1122
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:38,880
what else what is the right combination

1123
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,960
of the S pons uh Cesar my collaborator

1124
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,519
you know Cesar he likes to see it as a

1125
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,079
Melody he says it's like playing the

1126
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:47,880
piano you have to hit the right keys in

1127
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:51,559
order to produce music and so we want to

1128
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:54,280
find what that music is for S when

1129
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:58,280
lacton and

1130
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:03,000
Leukemia yes that's very in the phic

1131
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:06,720
markers in untreated disease reflect

1132
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:10,440
multiple paths for development

1133
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:12,519
of differences individual I think we

1134
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,559
don't know yet and I think the more we

1135
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:15,838
know we are doing sequencing and trying

1136
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,599
to match

1137
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:21,199
sequencing to to each individual patient

1138
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,359
we might be able to understand a little

1139
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:25,558
bit more and also I mean I didn't want

1140
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,558
to mention it to don't make not to make

1141
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:28,880
everything so more complic ated because

1142
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:31,880
you are all going to get out very

1143
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,200
depressed after all of this information

1144
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,760
is that there is a lot of heterogeneity

1145
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:39,960
even with within the heterogen I told

1146
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:42,760
you in the tumor there is still clonal

1147
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,440
heterogen meaning within the same

1148
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,440
patient you're going to have several

1149
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:49,440
clones with different

1150
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,880
mutations so when I think about

1151
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,960
targeting leukemia lukemia stem cells

1152
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:56,838
we're playing the game wack wack them

1153
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:59,880
all you hit one and the other one one

1154
00:50:56,838 --> 00:51:04,400
comes out of you and we just try to find

1155
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:06,440
a huge Hammer to get them all down so um

1156
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,200
so this is this is a problem and

1157
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,679
probably it's also that heterogenity

1158
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:14,318
that you have in the genotype that will

1159
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:16,039
be reflected in the phenotype and

1160
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:17,920
because all of this is evolving so

1161
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:21,358
rapidly maybe we'll very soon have

1162
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:23,680
enough information to match the theer S

1163
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:25,920
oface signature with that some genetic

1164
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:28,558
signature and will help us distinguish

1165
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,559
them one from the

1166
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:34,000
yes is there any possibility that when

1167
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,838
you do the serial transplants that

1168
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,760
because everything is so rapidly

1169
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:43,400
evolving that um like like a leukemia

1170
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:46,520
cell that's not a stem cell can gain

1171
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:49,358
more stem cell like properties and kind

1172
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:51,199
of like be a Founder for the disease

1173
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:53,759
even though it wasn't originally a

1174
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:55,480
leukemia stem cell where it was coming

1175
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,000
from or is that not something that

1176
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,039
really happens so this is a hypothesis

1177
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,719
that people have thought but not only in

1178
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:04,880
the mouth also in people so that's what

1179
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:08,318
when I told you about the origin of

1180
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:11,000
leukemia is that's a hypothesis we don't

1181
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,759
know what is the directionality of the

1182
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,639
cells which so the definition of a

1183
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:19,440
leukemia stem cell does not mean it's a

1184
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:22,798
cell that came from a normal Stem Cell

1185
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,760
It's a cell that Acquire The ability to

1186
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:26,199
behave like a stem cell so could have

1187
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,200
been a more mature could have been a

1188
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:29,519
blast

1189
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:32,279
but the right combination of genetic

1190
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:35,280
modifications or epigenetic modification

1191
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,480
give them the capacity to self renew and

1192
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,040
give rise to progeny so yes the more and

1193
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,760
actually there's studies that have shown

1194
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:45,239
the more aggressive the tumor becomes

1195
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:48,079
even impatient so if you take a patient

1196
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:51,118
a diagnosis and separate c34 positive

1197
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:53,200
c38 negative cells you can see the

1198
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,039
hierarchy as I described to you Works

1199
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:58,279
beautifully the stem cells are the stem

1200
00:52:55,039 --> 00:53:00,798
cells and then you have the pl etc etc

1201
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:03,240
if you take sample from a relapse

1202
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:06,079
patient the same patient at relapse and

1203
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:09,318
take the different c34 positive 38

1204
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:12,119
negative and then other cells every cell

1205
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:14,400
will behave like a stem cell so the

1206
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:16,160
hierarchy is not maintained in that case

1207
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,200
meaning that chemotherapy must have

1208
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,798
changed something in the process so

1209
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:25,639
that's why we think we to really catch

1210
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:28,000
and kill the cells from the beginning or

1211
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:29,440
when they are asent before they come

1212
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,559
back once they come back they're a

1213
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,960
different

1214
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,920
monster I think we'll stop the question

1215
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,639
andless somebody has a real

1216
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,599
important so again thank you very much

1217
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,598
one again thank

1218
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,920
you this has been a production of
