00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,839
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:04,839
University

3
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:10,599
my name is Johannes lemon I teach salty

4
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:12,609
nutrient management at Cornell

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,720
University I'm very excited to get

6
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:19,719
together with all of you and and

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,969
maintain the the dynamics and an

8
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:25,118
enthusiasm around soil health and take

9
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:27,099
forward want to give a shout out to to

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:30,009
my team of course a lot of the research

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,609
lesson on the young ones growing

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:37,090
generation of professional in this area

13
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:40,120
and and provide enormous to the story of

14
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:43,569
Agriculture maybe some of the dark side

15
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:47,308
that causes some issues in nutrient

16
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:50,100
management as nutrients and other

17
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:53,018
substances such as hormones antibiotics

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,179
other endocrine disrupters are coming

19
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:57,908
into our soils and from there into the

20
00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:00,519
water so that we are faced with

21
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:03,548
eutrophication and other ecosystem

22
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:05,530
service losses including no swimming for

23
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:09,909
students in the summer in Cayuga Lake

24
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:12,219
which is a big problem so we we are

25
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:16,509
looking at ways of innovative ways to to

26
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:19,150
bring waste to value and one of these

27
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,540
approaches thermochemical approach is

28
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:25,980
pyrolysis where we can show together

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:28,330
with a company in Rochester and a

30
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:32,230
professional knows I'll make her for

31
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:36,750
Venus grows and and homeowners moment hi

32
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:39,370
mark and that we can indeed transform a

33
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,049
problematic ways such as dairy manure

34
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:46,390
very wet waste into a marketable

35
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:49,319
substance for greenhouse growers that

36
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:52,689
has a relatively hard large value

37
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:55,269
already in in the solids we came up as a

38
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:58,569
replacement value for close to two

39
00:01:55,269 --> 00:02:01,899
thousand dollars per ton of of material

40
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:05,199
of dairy manure material that otherwise

41
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,719
otherwise would have a negative cost aka

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,459
a social and environmental and

43
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:14,829
commercial cost and burden we we want to

44
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:18,310
take that forward because many of the

45
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:19,000
waste Barry is one other animal wastes

46
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,920
are others

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,090
but there are a lot of different ways

48
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:26,889
that are are in our food system some of

49
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,039
them are in rural environments some of

50
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:33,309
them are point sources in industrial

51
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,929
food processing here is one of them so

52
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,180
we're talking with uh noisy Bush about

53
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:41,170
their waists and and seeing how we can

54
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:44,020
recycle them and find ways to recycle

55
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:47,649
nitrogen which is a huge problem in this

56
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:51,280
respect we are discovering that we can

57
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,789
actually strip nitrogen out of liquid

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,479
phases and precipitate them find them on

59
00:02:54,789 --> 00:03:01,389
carbonaceous surfaces and that's that's

60
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,849
very new science that shows that we can

61
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:06,399
make carbonaceous material that actually

62
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:09,189
has as much nitrogen up eighteen percent

63
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,129
nitrogen we're getting into the area of

64
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:14,379
a commercial nitrogen fertilizer we are

65
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:18,819
trying to find innovative ways to

66
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:23,049
utilize carbon dioxide to coat animal

67
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:25,479
manure carbonaceous material with co2

68
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:28,599
functional groups that then capture more

69
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:32,859
ammonia gas so we're trying to figure

70
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:35,769
out ways of recycling solids as well as

71
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,769
nitrogen in the gas phase that would

72
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,930
have application for both their industry

73
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:43,830
but also the poultry industry where we

74
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,810
know we have a lot of nitrogen pollution

75
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:50,440
aerial nitrogen pollution that then

76
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:54,340
finds its way in waterways and and and

77
00:03:50,439 --> 00:04:00,419
ends up causing problems in water

78
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:05,759
resources we are have recently opened a

79
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:09,849
process facility that works at scale and

80
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:14,469
are now ready to work with industry both

81
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:16,449
farmers at the end of using materials as

82
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:19,870
a soil amendment to recycle nutrients

83
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:23,560
and and carbon as well as industry that

84
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:26,199
have waste both on farm and the food

85
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,449
industry in the middle as large

86
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:32,800
producers and we welcome discussions

87
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:40,449
about that and are open for your wastes

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:43,478
thank you very much this has been a

89
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:47,699
production of Cornell University on the
