1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,158
University

3
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:11,519
good so thank you very much for coming

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,580
I'm not sure if you're here for the food

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,100
or you're here to to listen to me

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,640
but I'm going to talk to you about my

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,760
favorite topic it's something which um

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,740
um when I started working in Pakistan I

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,439
kept hearing this from the extension

10
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,879
people the more you till the higher the

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,058
yield

12
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:36,600
and uh ever since then I've been trying

13
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:38,759
to find uh find out why if you don't do

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,239
no-till you actually have higher yields

15
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:45,359
so hopefully that's the message today

16
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:49,320
so uh let's see

17
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:53,640
how do we get these things to actually

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,039
okay so this is a just a brief outline I

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,460
want to remind everybody about what the

20
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,960
future challenges are for for

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,179
agriculture in the future because a lot

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,019
of you in this room are going to be

23
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:10,019
working on this in the future so I'm

24
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:12,478
retired I've done my bit

25
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,158
um so then I want to look at the history

26
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,280
and benefits the problems and

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,080
consequences of tillage the importance

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,180
of soil health I think this is something

29
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,759
which is going to be really important

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,439
for future

31
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,019
agriculture I want to look at the

32
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,879
definition of no-till and conservation

33
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:30,539
agriculture

34
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:33,420
um

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,060
there are different there are some new

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,759
definitions which I want to uh just to

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,400
show you what are some of the benefits

38
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,438
of conservation Agriculture and then I

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,719
want to show you well how did I get into

40
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:49,078
this in the first place

41
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,420
um and uh and then I've got a website

42
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:54,658
what I vote what have I been doing since

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,519
I uh retired okay what is life like

44
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,240
after Cornell

45
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,239
um essentially

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,659
so I like to do this I do this in my um

47
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:09,719
the classes that I used to teach uh here

48
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,719
we need to increase food production we

49
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:15,680
have to do it in a sustainable way and

50
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:18,359
it has to meet both food and nutritional

51
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,360
nutritional food security

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,420
because we have a growing population

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,480
okay maybe not in U.S maybe not in China

54
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:29,759
but we do have in other parts of the

55
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,919
world and at the same time we must

56
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:35,159
minimize the effects on the environment

57
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,139
and what I think is really important is

58
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,299
improving the livelihoods of those

59
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,939
involved in agriculture

60
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,800
maybe not so much in the US because you

61
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:47,479
only have a small percentage of people

62
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,980
involved in agriculture but if you go to

63
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:54,238
India for example you've got 20 million

64
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:57,018
farmers and uh how do we also improve

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,019
their livelihoods

66
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,379
um essentially the way to do that is to

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,598
improve the efficiency as this is an

68
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:06,299
agronomist I'm an agronomist I'm not an

69
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,518
economist not a social scientist I'm an

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,439
agronomist to improve the efficiency of

71
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,060
the natural resource used needed for

72
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,098
agricultural production how do we

73
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,400
improve fertilizer efficiency how do we

74
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:20,098
how do we uh do this

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,400
and we have to do this at a time when

76
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:26,158
demand for food is increasing we already

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,500
have areas of food insecurity and even

78
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,179
more now because of what happened with

79
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,120
covid

80
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,260
um the harvested area per capita is

81
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,719
diminishing

82
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:38,639
in other words we have to produce more

83
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,580
from a smaller area

84
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,798
uh traditional sources of productivity

85
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,360
already being used farmers are using

86
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,700
improved varieties they're using

87
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,700
fertilizer using irrigation they're

88
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,818
using mechanization Etc

89
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:57,919
um there's competition for water

90
00:03:52,818 --> 00:04:01,139
this is a big issue uh future oil prices

91
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,839
we saw the spike that we had not long

92
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,719
ago I think in the future they're going

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,598
to become even more so and that has a

94
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,239
big impact on the cost of inputs

95
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,818
climate change we're seeing this I'm

96
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,560
glad I don't live in California

97
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:18,000
um where you have this this problem

98
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,620
there

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,259
um there's already resource

100
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,780
environmental and land degradation uh

101
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:27,539
the dietary changes for example in India

102
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:31,319
a lot of uh people in India would be

103
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,360
vegetarian but now they like to eat uh

104
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:37,079
meat and chicken

105
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,900
Etc and then buy a few biofuel competing

106
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,519
for agricultural land and more I'm sure

107
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:44,638
there are more

108
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,639
so I suggest that business as usual will

109
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,800
not get the job done so what are we

110
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,740
going to do about that so I wanted to

111
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,720
start with that that statement

112
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,579
so let's talk a little bit about the

113
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,720
history of tillage

114
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,300
um

115
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,800
essentially when hunter-gatherers

116
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,139
decided to be more sedentary

117
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,780
they would uh essentially plant their

118
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,759
crops with a simple planting stick make

119
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:14,939
a hole in the ground put some seeds in

120
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,900
and whatever comes up was fine

121
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:21,959
and then around 4000 BC you the the

122
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:26,638
farmers started using livestock manual

123
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:30,418
power uh Manpower with simple plows and

124
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,478
tools to uh to produce their food

125
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:35,698
I put the three sisters up there because

126
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,978
um the three sisters was probably one of

127
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,620
the first conservation agriculture

128
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:43,379
practices that you see and you all know

129
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,899
what that the three sisters is because

130
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:49,019
essentially they make mounds and then

131
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:51,599
they they plant corn and and into crop

132
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:55,139
with corn and legumes and squash or

133
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,660
pumpkins uh and then but they don't plow

134
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,600
it again they come back and and use that

135
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:04,199
as a a no-till system

136
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:07,259
flowers were in to invert soil 17th

137
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,560
century 19th century steam-powered

138
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,780
tractors early 20th gasoline with steel

139
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,339
plowed rubber wheels and then modern

140
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,339
tractors which we have today

141
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,379
not that one

142
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,060
so why do people do till tillage well

143
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,699
these are some of the reasons weed

144
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:30,060
control is one of the big ones uprooting

145
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:32,699
removing or burying you could uproot and

146
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:37,680
remove by hand or you could do it with a

147
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:38,840
hole or you could do it with uh uh with

148
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,879
the

149
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,799
tillage

150
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,740
oxidation of organic matter and release

151
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,259
of nutrients so when you when you plow

152
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,780
the soil you oxidize the organic matter

153
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,340
and this is releases nutrients which is

154
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:56,339
really important make the Surface

155
00:06:53,339 --> 00:07:00,418
friable for planting or transplanting

156
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:02,939
and here's an example of rice I'm a rice

157
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:05,579
agronomist and a weed agronomist

158
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:08,219
um puddling the rice for soil puddling

159
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:11,459
is where you plow the soil when it's wet

160
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:15,120
you form a plow pan impound the water

161
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:18,359
which then helps control weeds and also

162
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,240
soften the soft transplanting

163
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,460
but this is some of the consequences of

164
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,300
tillage this is from Brazil

165
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:30,839
poor tillage practices uh uh you see

166
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,180
this erosion and essentially your top

167
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,159
soil and nutrients are going Downstream

168
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,519
or out of the ocean

169
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,039
here's some other consequences of this

170
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:45,120
um the one down here

171
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:46,139
shows these um a lot of this is a lot of

172
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,978
the top

173
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,978
and that is

174
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,400
and then of course the big example of

175
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,840
the problems facilities Dust Bowl I

176
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,638
don't want to spend a lot of time on

177
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,519
that but can you imagine being the

178
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,939
father living in that house

179
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,939
when this happened

180
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,339
so what we have is essentially you

181
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,620
increase tillage it's not you release

182
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,839
nutrients but you have an economic

183
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,939
organic I'm talking about organic matter

184
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,560
energy

185
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,160
um this affects the microbial

186
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,160
communities

187
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,500
hey so we reduce soil education for

188
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,830
drainage you get compaction and then you

189
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,979
you chill again so you get this spiral

190
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,979
[Music]

191
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:51,120
okay so now I can't move

192
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,539
so this is the sort of a downward spiral

193
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,159
of poor soil Health uh with with tillage

194
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:58,980
and it's not something that happens

195
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:02,939
overnight but over a long period of time

196
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:06,659
you see these uh this degradation

197
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:10,080
so is tillage really necessary

198
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:11,879
or as this person says are we just

199
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,459
burning our money

200
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,879
and releasing carbon dioxide into the

201
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,879
atmosphere

202
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:24,719
so let's talk a little bit about soil

203
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:28,439
health and this FAO book that's listed

204
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,660
here save and grow can you hear me

205
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,660
you can hold this closer

206
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,120
yeah

207
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,620
so this book at the bottom uh save and

208
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,500
grow has a lot of really good

209
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:47,120
information but essentially agriculture

210
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,320
must learn to return to its roots by its

211
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,879
rediscovering the importance of healthy

212
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,399
soil

213
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,240
um drawing on natural sources of plant

214
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:59,220
nutrition and using mineral fertilizer

215
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,580
wisely and then there's a statement

216
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,879
there I won't spend time on it but

217
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:08,100
essentially a healthy soil I have some

218
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,379
slides I want to show on that so the

219
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:14,040
importance of soil health

220
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:17,519
and this was uh the the director of USDA

221
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,799
uh in 2019 he says when we restore the

222
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,080
soil we see an improvement in quantity

223
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,479
and quality of food

224
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,259
and then the whole goal is to take

225
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,659
agriculture to the next level uh and

226
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,059
this will require Creative Solutions and

227
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:36,259
collaboration between everyone touched

228
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,259
in agriculture

229
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:43,080
so if you look at a a degraded soil this

230
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,240
is some of the properties all physical

231
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,480
properties problems of water

232
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,620
infiltration more pathogens nutrient

233
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,759
deficiencies

234
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,639
Etc

235
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:56,338
whereas a healthy soil be higher in

236
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,259
organic matter and has some of the

237
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,120
opposite effects of what you see on the

238
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:03,059
left

239
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,000
so a forest soil for example where you

240
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:08,338
have it's not Disturbed and it has leaf

241
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,639
mulch or it has mulches on the ground

242
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:16,740
this this is what you find with uh with

243
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:19,100
a if you sample a forest soil

244
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,620
but the one on the left intense

245
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,320
intensively mined agricultural soil no

246
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,480
organic amendments essentially

247
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,420
and I have this

248
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,700
this uh just says you know no addition

249
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:35,099
of organic matter with the Green

250
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,579
Revolution it worked really well for a

251
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:41,278
while until you decreased the organic

252
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,899
matter in the soil that affected the

253
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,980
soil biology

254
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:49,679
Etc and so what we need is is a

255
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,079
combination of both organic matter and

256
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:55,739
and chemical fertilizer

257
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:58,739
um so this is on this side

258
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,899
present farming practices now I'm not

259
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:04,019
just talking about the US I'm talking

260
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:06,240
about global my experience is mostly in

261
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:09,899
South Asia

262
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,320
and this is a healthy soil using organic

263
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:15,839
amendments minimal soil disturbance uh

264
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,379
and some of these other other important

265
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,899
important things rotations

266
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,000
so I will be talking about conservation

267
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,458
agriculture

268
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,820
and if we go through

269
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:32,939
uh so our biological diversity I think

270
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,620
if any of you have taken Janice's course

271
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,560
um you've already gone through this and

272
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,839
if you haven't taken it take it because

273
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:42,479
it's really going to be important in the

274
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,200
future but essentially what you're

275
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,120
trying to do is improve the bio

276
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,399
biodiversity of the soil in terms of

277
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,240
microbes

278
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:56,639
and a healthy soil has more microbes

279
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:00,060
than an unhealthy soil I also have a

280
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:03,060
video called life in the soil which I

281
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:06,239
like to look at when I saw that video it

282
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:08,699
was done by a Japanese group I began to

283
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,560
understand why this was so important it

284
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,680
was something that was going on below

285
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:17,179
the soil surface you couldn't see it

286
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,179
but it was really important

287
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,299
okay

288
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:23,519
and what what I'm going to hypothesize

289
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:26,278
is that conservation agriculture which

290
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,519
I'm going to describe soon plays a

291
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:33,838
critical role in below ground diversity

292
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,759
and disease and past suppression

293
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,339
so the big question is you can talk

294
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,500
about it and in fact Cornell uh our

295
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:43,680
department soils and crop science has a

296
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,440
really excellent program on soil health

297
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,239
and you can measure it but how do you

298
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,820
improve it

299
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,639
so that's the question question how do

300
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,339
you improve soil health

301
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,079
and I want to just go back to a little

302
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,959
bit on sustainable Crop Production

303
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,479
intensification the Green Revolution

304
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:05,759
Paradigm I saw disturbance modern high

305
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,720
yield varieties High purchased input use

306
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:13,379
and we got good higher yields and higher

307
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:16,259
output it helped to essentially prevent

308
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:19,078
famines that occurred in the 30s and 40s

309
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:22,319
and 50s you don't hear as many of these

310
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:24,479
families who do today the downside is

311
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,180
that there was pollution Farmers used

312
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,360
too much fertilizer reduced efficiency

313
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:34,138
loss of soil Health erosion and and and

314
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:38,100
and side effects so what we really need

315
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:41,039
to be doing in the future is sustainable

316
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,959
intensification Paradigm I use the word

317
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,778
responsible because I can't always

318
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:49,138
Define what sustainability is

319
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:52,019
but I can I can Define to you what I

320
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,759
think is responsible

321
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:56,820
strengthen soil health and natural

322
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,399
processes to boost production

323
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,860
um and environmental services avoid

324
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,600
waste input use only as much as the

325
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,019
system will take and improve the

326
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,940
efficiency of Natural Resources

327
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:10,799
there are a number of new definitions

328
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,440
everybody seems to want to have a new

329
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,059
definition every year or two or three

330
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,699
years you get a new definition so

331
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,239
climate smart agriculture came out about

332
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:23,159
10 years ago our regenerative

333
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,639
agriculture is there now agroecological

334
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:29,879
farming I'm not going to spend time on

335
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,278
this there is a link on my program which

336
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:36,059
will take you to these definitions

337
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:38,278
and that there are others all I contend

338
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:41,039
is that if you're talking about soil

339
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:43,799
health and you're talking about uh from

340
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,019
an agronomic point of view conservation

341
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,919
agriculture would be involved somewhere

342
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,919
in all three of those

343
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:56,638
they never mentioned it but it's that's

344
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:59,699
what they do so let's talk about

345
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,198
um mechanized no-till

346
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:04,939
the Dust Bowl

347
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:08,338
use of inversion tillage led to the this

348
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,920
what happened is that the scientists and

349
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,440
the soil scientists came up with the

350
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:16,019
term conservation tillage conservation

351
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,779
tillage was reduced tillage with a

352
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:21,720
chisel plow and stubbles were left on

353
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:24,899
the soil surface about 30 so that was

354
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,540
the beginning of no-till beginning of

355
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:30,500
conservation agriculture uh the

356
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:33,958
Forerunner of no tillage farming

357
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:37,259
1943 I'm not sure that um

358
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:40,439
our Dutch friend is here today

359
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:43,560
um but um he always in his class uh

360
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,899
talks about plowman's Folly this book is

361
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:48,299
in the library if you want to read it

362
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:51,120
no one has ever Advanced a scientific

363
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:53,698
reason for for plowing

364
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,519
okay there's simply no need for plowing

365
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:58,799
in the first instance and most of the

366
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,860
operations that costs customarily follow

367
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,838
the plowing are entirely unnecessary if

368
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,660
the land has not been plowed there is

369
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,140
nothing wrong with our soil except our

370
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,600
interference so this is uh this is I'd

371
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,220
like to use this is to say hey think

372
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:19,859
about it don't don't reject no-till uh

373
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:23,220
24d herbicide that came out in 1940s

374
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:26,698
helped to control weeds a lot of people

375
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,160
say well no-till you have a weed problem

376
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:32,340
uh so it doesn't work

377
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,980
well that's a good opportunity for weed

378
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:37,819
scientists to find Solutions on how to

379
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,319
resolve the weed problem

380
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:44,819
research and testing of no-till in all

381
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:48,659
continents from 1960 to 2000 and limited

382
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:52,439
scaling with farmers in 1980s and 1990s

383
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,820
okay so it's not very far away still in

384
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,360
my lifetime

385
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:59,939
and by 2000 there was about 65 million

386
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:02,538
hectares of no-till cropland systems in

387
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,538
in the world

388
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:07,440
now I want to switch over the

389
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:10,139
conservation agriculture

390
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,519
um I call this an ecosystem approach to

391
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:18,919
regenerative sustainable agriculture

392
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:22,319
um from 1970 to 97 there was a lot of

393
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,419
farmer experimentation a lot of research

394
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:28,079
being done in various parts of the world

395
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:30,480
to Define what are the key components of

396
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:35,220
a sustainable no-till system

397
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:37,679
in 1997 meeting in Mexico these two

398
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,980
people were very well known in the

399
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,880
conservation from FAO came up with the

400
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,798
definition

401
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,260
conservation agriculture so we're

402
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:48,599
talking about 1998.

403
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:50,819
that's not too long ago

404
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:53,639
and essentially what the three pillars

405
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:55,859
of conservation agriculture is little on

406
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,280
those sold disturbance

407
00:18:55,859 --> 00:19:01,319
okay no-till or no just enough to get

408
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,079
the seed into the soil

409
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:07,439
uh permanent soil cover that's really

410
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,720
important and this can be residues of

411
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,900
the previous crop or it can be cover

412
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,120
crops and I should also point out that

413
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:19,980
conservation Agriculture no-till and

414
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:22,979
cover crops is becoming a big uh uh

415
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,599
thing to get into importance to Farmers

416
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,480
uh

417
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:30,178
and they provide some of the uh some of

418
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,440
the things don't burn the residue

419
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,960
okay

420
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,720
the easiest thing to do is to get a box

421
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,240
of matches and pile up some of the straw

422
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,160
and and light it and the next thing you

423
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,400
know everybody's uh

424
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,038
having to wear masks not for covid but

425
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,580
because of air pollution

426
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:53,460
and then crop rotation and later the

427
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:55,199
diversity of crops now what you find is

428
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,720
that some Farmers just do one of those

429
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,360
they might just do no-till

430
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,298
some of them realize afterwards that no

431
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:06,359
till Plus cover crops Plus or residue

432
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:07,859
leaving residues is really important and

433
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,699
I'm going to show you some slides on

434
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:12,058
there

435
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:15,298
and then rotation may come in later on

436
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:17,279
okay so so a lot of people criticize

437
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:19,079
well conservation you know they only do

438
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,720
one of these so therefore conservation

439
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,538
is no good so and this is one of the

440
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,058
sources uh this is in a new Journal

441
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:29,640
called Agronomy not the American Society

442
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:33,200
of agronomy Journal

443
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,640
um experiences and lessons from concert

444
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,798
conservation agriculture

445
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,320
so they have this picture

446
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:44,700
you can see the Dust Bowl in 1930 so

447
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:47,639
around 1950 1970 you see this big

448
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:52,100
increase in conservation agriculture or

449
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:55,559
no-till agriculture to where in 20 20

450
00:20:52,099 --> 00:21:00,779
well over 200 million hectares of

451
00:20:55,558 --> 00:21:02,058
no-till in the world at the moment okay

452
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:07,319
and

453
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:07,319
2022 it's probably up around 220.

454
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,480
and where is that

455
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:14,400
here the data one of the big problems

456
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,919
with getting data on conservation

457
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,840
agriculture is not collected by the

458
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,000
national programs

459
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,220
so you have to find other ways of

460
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,679
getting this information but you can see

461
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:30,298
the main areas in South and Central

462
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:33,360
America May mostly Brazil Argentina a

463
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:36,200
very big no-till countries and you can

464
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:40,399
see the changes that have occurred since

465
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:43,558
2008-9 uh in the third column and then

466
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,320
how much a percentage of the ca air in

467
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:49,019
the region in 2018-19

468
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,819
some of them are still fairly small look

469
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,599
what happened in Ukraine it was very

470
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:58,619
small in 2008 but it became uh much

471
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:00,619
bigger in in 2018

472
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:00,619
um

473
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:07,200
six million hectares because it's

474
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:09,599
probably none there at the moment so

475
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,940
but I want to also raise this that it

476
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,459
doesn't solve all problems there's no

477
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,159
Panacea it's just a way of helping to

478
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:21,179
improve don't forget all of the other

479
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:24,299
modern or good activities that are

480
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:27,360
needed for producing food things like

481
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:29,298
good genetic stock good potential good

482
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,699
uh these things

483
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:34,619
integrated in other words minimum soil

484
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,860
disturbance saw cover and pop diversity

485
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,939
and not you need to also do all of these

486
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:41,219
other things

487
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:45,259
integrated approaches to Pest Management

488
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,259
nutrient management weed management

489
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:50,158
Etc

490
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,020
uh mechanization permanent bed and

491
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,179
photos by the way conservation

492
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:56,579
agriculture can be done on the flat or

493
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:59,298
it can be done on beds or it can be done

494
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:59,298
in basins

495
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:06,538
so sustainable Crop Production aims to

496
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,580
maximize options for crop production and

497
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:10,740
intensification while minimizing the

498
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:12,058
effect on biodiversity and ecosystem

499
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,480
services

500
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:17,819
and we also need to think of livestock

501
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,798
in here as well

502
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:22,500
so

503
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:24,000
no tillage it's called many things in

504
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,079
different parts of the world so in

505
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,900
Brazil it might be uh

506
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:34,079
siembra director but it it's a rapidly

507
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:37,259
growing practice in the world

508
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:39,000
but notice the residue cover the residue

509
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:41,839
cover is one of the most important

510
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,058
aspects of this

511
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:47,699
some of the benefits I've listed a lot

512
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:49,619
of them there uh I've highlighted

513
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,240
increased soil biolog biological

514
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:56,219
activity uh erosion

515
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,558
infiltration of water there's a number

516
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,798
of things there but I think the last one

517
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:03,839
reduced labor and costs are the main

518
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:06,900
things that motivate Farmers to

519
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:09,178
experiment with this technology

520
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:12,179
okay because one of the important things

521
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:14,038
with any technology the farmers have to

522
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,440
adopt it if it's going to have any

523
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:18,960
impact on food security

524
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,620
and so I'm not going to spend a lot of

525
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,720
time on that today but how do you get

526
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:26,879
Farmers to practice this it's very easy

527
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,319
to take a bag of seed and say hey this

528
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,440
is a better variety

529
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:35,339
that's very simple but try doing it with

530
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,840
a a technology like a complex technology

531
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:41,939
like uh like this

532
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:45,418
so I wanted to show this picture

533
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:49,200
this is in Australia left hand side

534
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:51,600
no-till right hand side conventional

535
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,360
right notice

536
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,859
there's 35 more infiltration of water on

537
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,779
the left hand side

538
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:59,579
it's counter-intuitive right you do

539
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,779
tillage so you get better infiltration

540
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:03,538
of water

541
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:05,158
well actually the textbooks are wrong on

542
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,319
that

543
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,760
on the right hand side see how that

544
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,399
water is ponding

545
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,558
and what's happening is that water's

546
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,019
running off and causing the problems of

547
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:18,599
top soil loss but notice the residue is

548
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:21,000
still there on the left hand side

549
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:22,199
and if you look at the same field at

550
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,058
Harvest Time

551
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,558
on the left hand side you see the

552
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:27,778
no-till maze

553
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:31,139
and on the right hand side you see where

554
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:33,359
the conventional tillage so we have a we

555
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:36,240
actually have a maze crop and some some

556
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,819
yield on the left hand side and zero

557
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,880
yield maize on the right hand side

558
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:44,519
and it's all due to essentially uh

559
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,320
infiltration of water and this was just

560
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,359
drought stress

561
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,079
and I've got the same thing from cement

562
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,479
I worked at Summit Wheaton maze Center

563
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:56,819
uh no-till plus residue and this is a

564
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,120
long-term trial so this is maybe after

565
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:02,700
uh you know 10 years or 15 years of

566
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:05,819
doing no-till and residue in this plot

567
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,759
and this is without residue no-till same

568
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:09,538
no-till but this is without residue so

569
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:12,419
you

570
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:14,819
you really need that residue to help

571
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:18,240
with the surface to allow infiltration

572
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,079
of water to work with the soil biology

573
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,179
Etc

574
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,178
and the same thing happens on wheat

575
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:29,460
this is no-till without residue this is

576
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:32,278
until now no-till without residue what

577
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:34,679
they did is they burnt the residue

578
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:37,140
so burning residue is not a not a good

579
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,600
idea so sometimes people say well

580
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,900
no-till is no good see look you get

581
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:46,379
lower yields well it takes time to get

582
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:48,840
this let me see and no-till does not

583
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,840
equal conservation agriculture you need

584
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:55,079
the the the residue

585
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:58,259
so here's a picture in uh of soybeans in

586
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:01,319
Brazil after wheat

587
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:03,778
um here's another picture from uh Zambia

588
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:06,839
or a graduate student from our

589
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:10,619
department went there and what you see

590
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:13,500
down here is um let's see down the base

591
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:17,459
space of the base of the the maze Parts

592
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,798
they've actually Dug Dug a basin

593
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,319
and in that Basin they put some organic

594
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:24,778
matter in and they planted Maize but

595
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:28,500
they could also plant into crop with

596
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:30,720
some legumes as well and what we

597
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:34,140
recommended is that after they harvest

598
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,140
this is don't dig those again but make

599
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,960
them permanent permanent basins

600
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,240
and therefore all of the improvements in

601
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:47,659
the soil quality and this is a practice

602
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,659
from from uh from North Africa

603
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:58,759
is this is a traditional system

604
00:27:55,558 --> 00:28:02,819
so small or big farms can do this

605
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:05,579
tractor to manual or animal power mono

606
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:08,399
or mixed cropping trees can be added

607
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:11,220
irrigated or rain fed flat or raised bed

608
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,340
planting basins or Mounds depending on

609
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:18,360
whether you have a problem with drainage

610
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:22,139
the three sisters is an example of uh of

611
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:25,798
a mound a mound system

612
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:29,640
here's a picture in in East Africa of

613
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:31,859
these uh trees being put in and this is

614
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,080
a leguminous tree some of the farmers

615
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:36,240
will actually Lop off some of the um

616
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,460
some of the branches and use that as

617
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,620
fertilizer

618
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,140
so he's taught what about resource

619
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:45,778
Farmers you know average Farm size in

620
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,159
India is about one hectare a couple of

621
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:48,900
Acres

622
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,640
um how do how do these they can't afford

623
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,519
to have a tractor how are they going to

624
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,620
do this this work

625
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,658
um they have these various things they

626
00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:01,019
don't have enough money

627
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:03,360
um uh lack of income they they don't

628
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:06,119
want to they don't want to take the risk

629
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:08,038
associated with new technology what we

630
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,139
recommend is the use of service

631
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,480
providers and this is what has happened

632
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,919
in India in some of these countries

633
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,778
service provider you take a young person

634
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,299
provide him with the equipment that he

635
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:24,500
needs and then he comes to the farmers

636
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:27,720
and essentially does the the the the the

637
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:30,179
no-till and the residue into the residue

638
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,579
for that farmer he may even be able to

639
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,259
provide some of the inputs and some of

640
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:37,259
the thing for forfeit

641
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:39,839
and in fact a lot of the farmers in in

642
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:40,919
South Asia would do their plowing that

643
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,259
way

644
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:45,480
a farmer who had a tractor in the

645
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,339
village would do the first plowing or

646
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,460
the second plowing

647
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:52,678
um uh and they did it on the same so who

648
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,798
were the biggest opponents for no-till

649
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:59,220
uh when we went into South Asia where

650
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:01,679
those Farmers that had tractors that got

651
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:04,140
income from the tillage

652
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,840
but we soon convinced them to actually

653
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,880
switch over when I say we I meant the

654
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,759
national programs and the scientists and

655
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,620
the people that we worked with

656
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,240
okay

657
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:18,058
the other thing which is really

658
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,240
important is that you need an innovation

659
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:24,898
Network to get the adoption you need to

660
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,298
local manufacturing local Machinery

661
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:28,759
makers and developers public sector

662
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:30,839
extension and universities

663
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:33,898
non-government extension groups

664
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:36,500
scientists Innovative Farmers credits

665
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,500
etc etc

666
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:40,798
this doesn't work so let me take this

667
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,220
off

668
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,220
okay

669
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:50,520
so you need a really this has to be

670
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:52,500
developed at the same time so you see

671
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,119
it's not a simple thing it's not

672
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,519
something which you can come in with a

673
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:58,918
bag of technology and say okay now adopt

674
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:01,440
this you have to get all of these actors

675
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:03,720
involved in stakeholders and the way we

676
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,679
did it in South Asia is by having what

677
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:10,259
we call champions in their country who

678
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,100
were able to to get all of this thing

679
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:13,099
happening

680
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,940
policy and institutions is also really

681
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,419
important this comes from the same save

682
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,759
and grow book from FAO to encourage

683
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:26,159
smallholders to adopt sustainable car

684
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,619
production fundamental changes are

685
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,500
needed in development policies and

686
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:33,599
institutions and there's some a list of

687
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,599
some of the things it has to be

688
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:39,199
profitable to the farmers otherwise they

689
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:42,240
uh they're not going to benefit from it

690
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,980
and also the enabling factors that need

691
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,679
to be in place to allow Farmers to

692
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,319
experiment with new ideas

693
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:52,259
foreign

694
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:54,240
so let's go back to when I first got

695
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:57,778
into Pakistan

696
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,778
okay that was in the 1980s

697
00:31:57,778 --> 00:32:03,298
and this is a graph that shows the

698
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:06,298
importance of planting date

699
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:08,639
right so if you look at this there's a

700
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:10,679
sort of a optimal planting date this is

701
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,259
wheat following rice

702
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:17,038
read following race and you can see that

703
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:19,220
about November 15th is the best date for

704
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,440
planting the planet a little bit earlier

705
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:26,519
uh you have problems with uh it being

706
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:28,320
too hot uh if you plant late what

707
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:32,639
happens is that

708
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:35,579
the plants the the wheat matures at a

709
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,179
time when the heat increases and you get

710
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:42,658
uh uh shriveling of grains and lower

711
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:43,740
yields by planting on time you can

712
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:46,140
escape

713
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,940
that heat stress and of course heat

714
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,659
stress is going to be more important

715
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:54,659
with climate change in the future

716
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:56,640
we now we could say the national program

717
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:58,679
breeders Palm breeders have now got

718
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,020
varieties of wheat that can be planted

719
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,419
as early as the end of October

720
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:07,918
without yield loss

721
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:10,320
and so therefore uh have higher yields

722
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,899
so we did a diagnostic survey in this

723
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:15,298
area we were getting low yields farmers

724
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:19,500
were planting their their wheat in

725
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:22,319
December and even in early January

726
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,778
and so late planting reduces wheat yield

727
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:27,119
that was the main main thing and there

728
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:29,460
were several reasons one of the reasons

729
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,500
was while the previous crop got

730
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,419
harvested late

731
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,000
um or they grew another crop before they

732
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:37,679
planted wheat or they had long duration

733
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,960
varieties there were a number of number

734
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,600
of factors some of those you can take

735
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,058
care of uh change the rice varieties

736
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:47,939
although that's not so easy

737
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:50,579
um and uh Etc then below but one of the

738
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:54,120
big things was the long turnaround time

739
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:55,558
from when rice was harvested and wheat

740
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,658
was planted

741
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:00,538
and the reason for that was excessive

742
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:02,100
tillage some Farmers pla actually plowed

743
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,919
20 times

744
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:07,619
because the saws were fairly had very

745
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,898
poor structure and they needed to they

746
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:13,618
they wanted to turn it into talcum

747
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:16,679
powder for planting

748
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:19,800
um or and that got rid of a lot of the

749
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,659
moisture or there was too much moisture

750
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,820
um or they were threshed of rice before

751
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:28,320
they wanted to do this plowing or they

752
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:31,320
were power constraints okay

753
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,800
so that's where we came up with what why

754
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:38,179
do they do it tillage can you imagine uh

755
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,760
plowing with a Bullock and a wooden plow

756
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:44,639
and having to walk uh up and down the

757
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,060
field 20 times to get tillage you can

758
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,700
imagine how much so we we had a a New

759
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:53,519
Zealand uh manufacturer of equipment

760
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:56,158
come to Pakistan and one of the key

761
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,199
components with this uh this Colter this

762
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,440
opener

763
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:03,838
inverted t uh open it and you see what

764
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,320
they did is the local manufacturers were

765
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:09,239
able to put this put this opener on

766
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:13,380
their drills

767
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:17,159
they could then plant into the residue

768
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,660
um with uh and apply both seed and

769
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:20,460
fertilizer so you had better

770
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:22,679
distribution of fertilizer more

771
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,500
efficient use of fertilizer

772
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:29,039
and this was good for fields for

773
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,019
harvested by hand so when in 1980s a lot

774
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,400
of the rice fields were harvested by

775
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:35,400
hand

776
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,519
okay so then you had anchored anchored

777
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,559
straw and this this didn't cause any

778
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:43,440
problems but then

779
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:46,320
as the 90s 2000s came along people

780
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,139
started to have uh service providers

781
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,838
doing combine harvesting

782
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:54,719
combine harvesting was leaving a lot of

783
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:57,119
loose residue on the surface so this

784
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:00,598
this system didn't work

785
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,240
but then the engineers in that area said

786
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,059
okay well how do we overcome that and

787
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:08,279
here's a simple John Blackwell from

788
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:10,739
Australia came up you can see the

789
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,920
no-till drill at the back and the back

790
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:15,899
here and then what this does pick up

791
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,079
picks up the straw

792
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:21,240
you plant in in uh you know where

793
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,160
there's no loose residue and then the

794
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:24,419
straw is put back down on the on the

795
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,779
cell surface

796
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,780
okay

797
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,320
so

798
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,559
what about the US well a couple of

799
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,780
things there's a lot of farmers and a

800
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,599
lot of organizations in the US that are

801
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,180
now doing no-tilling and this no-till

802
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,300
farmer magazine is something which you

803
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:48,919
might like to to look at and in this

804
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:51,300
magazine you also see uh

805
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,320
manufacturers of some of the implements

806
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:58,019
for working on cover crops or residues

807
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:01,559
loose residues in that area

808
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:03,300
and and places like South Asia and India

809
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:06,179
and China there's a lot of local

810
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,640
manufactures of equipment

811
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:10,919
um so you see in California there's a

812
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,539
lot of uh conservation agriculture now

813
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,539
being practiced there a lot of cover

814
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:19,039
crops being covered uh used there so

815
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,039
it's growing okay

816
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:25,920
this is what we want to prevent

817
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:28,140
you may have heard about in New Delhi

818
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,480
you could hardly breathe you had to stay

819
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:35,098
inside your house because it got so

820
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,780
thick with with the smoke that it was

821
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:39,720
dangerous for your health

822
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,540
and also a lot of that residue would

823
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:46,139
fall on the glaciers up in the up in the

824
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:48,779
Himalayas and then increase the Albedo

825
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:52,078
to where the the snow actually melts

826
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:54,300
faster now than it did before so how do

827
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,720
we how do we overcome this well we think

828
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,519
no-till uh is is the way to go and leave

829
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:02,239
that residue on the ground as your

830
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,239
resident cover

831
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:07,679
okay so what have I done since 2015 I

832
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:10,559
retired in 2015. I can't believe it was

833
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,179
seven years ago but when you retire it

834
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:16,739
doesn't mean to say you become a couch

835
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:19,618
potato okay so what I've been doing is I

836
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:23,519
uh curate maintain a conservation

837
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:25,140
agriculture website with Lucy Fisher

838
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:28,139
um I'll see if I can get this one to

839
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:30,719
work this is my website

840
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:33,420
um if you look at this website if you go

841
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,338
to here you look at the full research

842
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,440
database

843
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:40,799
this is what I spend most of my time on

844
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:45,000
at the moment you've all used zotero

845
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:49,700
and in soltero if you go to um if you go

846
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,699
to the conservation agriculture articles

847
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:58,799
I have

848
00:38:55,039 --> 00:39:00,659
2870 articles now in that database and

849
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,920
I'm adding to them everywhere every

850
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:06,659
month it's incredible how much how much

851
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,400
research has been done in this

852
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:12,659
particular field at the moment

853
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,420
and I also have key keywords I have the

854
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:18,000
DOI number I have the um the the

855
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:21,659
articles there if you need to get them

856
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,559
but you can find them at Cornell

857
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:27,719
um so I think I better stop there so we

858
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:30,420
can have some questions

859
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:32,699
I also put out a a newsletter and some

860
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,559
of you get my newsletter uh Stupid

861
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:38,578
newsletter where I pick the best

862
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:41,400
articles every month and send it out to

863
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:44,060
list serves and to various people

864
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,059
okay

865
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:55,799
the obvious question is what about the

866
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:57,719
plant diseases what about the Plant

867
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,359
Pathology you talk about weed control

868
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:02,098
but isn't that a serious problem with a

869
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:04,019
residue well

870
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,300
one of the interesting things is that

871
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:08,519
that's what you would expect right it's

872
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:11,460
what I do expect that's what you you

873
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:13,259
expect but actually in what what you

874
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,320
find is that if you can increase the

875
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:19,320
biological diversity in the soil

876
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,079
those or those organisms actually can

877
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,640
help control some of the parasitic uh

878
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,400
organisms

879
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,139
okay so talk to the people in Australia

880
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,338
talk to the people where this is

881
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:32,098
happening

882
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:33,960
um you do see cases of where you have

883
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,920
more disease more

884
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,900
um

885
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,079
wheat diseases for example in some

886
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,000
Fields I was thinking of rusts and smuts

887
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,160
and things like that Russ is not one I

888
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,099
would worry about the rust is one that

889
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,379
has carried from the air and it's in you

890
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:52,440
know you you that's why you have to use

891
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:54,900
good germ plasma and plant you you're

892
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,119
going to have rust diseases

893
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,559
but then you know that what one of the

894
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,660
interesting things about the Green

895
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:04,078
Revolution was the varieties that were

896
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:06,000
developed by cement or by Norman borlag

897
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,359
and that had very very good rust

898
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,539
resistance uh and that's why so you you

899
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,098
you you use integrated disease

900
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:17,940
management

901
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:20,220
use varieties that have resistance

902
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,019
but it's not something you can ignore I

903
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:23,338
agree yeah

904
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:25,380
yes

905
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:28,019
I was just going to ask a follow-up

906
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,280
question I might hypothesize and I

907
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,739
wonder if you had experience with this

908
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,540
the disease issue which I think comes up

909
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,459
a lot with revenues do you think that

910
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:37,500
might interact with the moisture regime

911
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,599
and how the moisture changes over time

912
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,480
climate change like in Upstate New York

913
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,820
maybe maybe in California right now if

914
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,900
you have a lot of water on that residue

915
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,820
you might have a very different

916
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,039
condition than maybe in Australia where

917
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,599
maybe most of the time is dry I would

918
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,820
imagine the microbes was paved very

919
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,099
differently in the two systems

920
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,260
yeah there's a lot of articles in the

921
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:00,240
database that I have that look at that

922
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,220
one of the interesting things when you

923
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:03,838
have the residue and do no-till is you

924
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:07,980
get much better infiltration of water

925
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:10,739
you have actually have more more Waters

926
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:13,079
sitting and ponding on the surface uh

927
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:14,939
with plaque with tillage and so then you

928
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:18,720
would have certain diseases that would

929
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:21,599
come up so I don't I

930
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:24,480
when you see 200 million hectares

931
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,579
it's obviously you know I don't think

932
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,159
it's as big a problem as you think but

933
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:32,460
if it is a problem then you need to then

934
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:34,259
and have a client Pathologists in your

935
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:38,039
program and you must have user

936
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:40,619
integrated uh disease management as part

937
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:42,599
of the so don't don't ignore that if you

938
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:44,519
have a weed problem you need to look at

939
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:47,640
integrated weed management rather than

940
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:51,599
just use a herbicide yeah

941
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:53,400
yes early instances you have regions or

942
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,800
particular crops where this would not be

943
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,338
appropriate and we do not be recommended

944
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,200
and there's still a constipation system

945
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:02,940
ah

946
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:05,159
I don't think so

947
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,679
um one of the big challenges is if you

948
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:09,598
start looking at Rice

949
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:12,858
but the problem with rice is that when

950
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,660
you do the puddling and you do the

951
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:18,480
transplanting first of all it uses a lot

952
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:20,940
of water it destroys the soil physical

953
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,400
properties of the soil may have some

954
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:26,579
impact on other properties of the soil

955
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,160
and and it's a very labor intensive and

956
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:31,740
costly so a lot of farmers are now

957
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:34,618
having problems finding people to do the

958
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:36,779
transplanting or do the puddling and

959
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:39,000
then the crop that follows that puddle

960
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,040
of soil is not very good so there's a

961
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,920
movement to go to direct seeded rice

962
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:46,880
right when you go to direct seeded rice

963
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,880
the first challenge

964
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:52,679
so you have to overcome the weed problem

965
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:55,019
but what we're finding what what when I

966
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:58,440
say we what is happening in the National

967
00:43:55,019 --> 00:44:00,300
programs I've left 20 years ago uh they

968
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,460
are coming up with Solutions using

969
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:04,500
integrative weed management to overcome

970
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,318
that problem so even rice if you have

971
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,900
rice no-till followed by wheat no-till

972
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:13,380
you have a much healthier soil and a

973
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:15,539
much higher yield but there are problems

974
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,220
uh problems of phosphorus there are

975
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:19,139
problems of some of these other

976
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:20,759
nutrients so you need integrated

977
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:22,618
nutrient management I don't see any

978
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,020
reason why you don't have to do

979
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:28,079
intensive tillage I think you can do

980
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:29,880
away with a minimum

981
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,260
yeah

982
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,740
right here

983
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:38,480
um just looking ahead a little bit so

984
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:38,479
um there's about two and a half

985
00:44:38,818 --> 00:44:44,779
which is increasingly

986
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:44,779
demanded for public transportation

987
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,059
it's just you know the resource I was

988
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:52,019
just wondering if there's any ways to

989
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:54,059
actually

990
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:55,559
be up to harvest up as a resource of

991
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:57,420
service and the benefits of the

992
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,199
professional attention the other aspects

993
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,480
of

994
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:02,899
conservation agriculture if you see that

995
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,900
teaches

996
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:09,539
it is possible

997
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,579
um I do see with with the no-till first

998
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:14,880
of all you don't not burning the diesel

999
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:17,339
for the land preparation

1000
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,960
you're also finding with the mulch on

1001
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:21,179
the surface that you're increasing the

1002
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,920
organic matter in the soil

1003
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:25,379
now there's a lot of papers now that

1004
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,599
show that you increase too much but if

1005
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,250
you don't need batteries and you take

1006
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:34,359
that resources

1007
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:34,358
[Music]

1008
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:42,000
well I don't think that you should be

1009
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:44,240
growing biofuels on an agricultural land

1010
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,239
foreign

1011
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:51,779
there is the whole issue of carbon

1012
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,239
carbon credits for uh this but I don't

1013
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,280
see how when you've got 20 million small

1014
00:45:54,239 --> 00:46:00,059
holder farmers in India how are you

1015
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:04,019
going to get payments for for you know

1016
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:06,900
Carbon sequestration uh but it's but you

1017
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:09,358
know that's something that you're in

1018
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:12,059
that area and so you go keep your job

1019
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:14,279
and the other students associated with

1020
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:16,980
you they can look at that issue

1021
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:21,800
all I'm saying is that we have a big

1022
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,800
problem with tillage system that we have

1023
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:32,399
you see that for example if you're

1024
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,199
either burning

1025
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,280
the recipe

1026
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:39,000
because

1027
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,160
it's simple but you know you know but

1028
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,559
also a lot of times the residue will be

1029
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:44,639
expected

1030
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,838
it is

1031
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:47,838
um foreign

1032
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:52,669
[Music]

1033
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:05,159
and so when you sometimes look at say a

1034
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:07,618
long-term experiment that is based on

1035
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:10,379
the ideal system where the residue goes

1036
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:12,900
back and then you look at practice where

1037
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:15,000
a lot of farmers remove the residue and

1038
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,440
nothing is nothing but bite that's it

1039
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,079
folks are very different situation

1040
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:23,000
no-kill without the restroom is very

1041
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:25,740
different and what's inheritance

1042
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,599
residue management is also a very key

1043
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:30,539
important and you have to be aware of

1044
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,940
the fact that farmers have animals and

1045
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:35,338
they need to be fed so you have this

1046
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,619
competition so you so but can you come

1047
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:39,719
up with something where you have some of

1048
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:41,940
the residues go to feed your animals and

1049
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:44,098
some of it goes to feed the soil

1050
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,679
you know so

1051
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:48,720
I mean it's not it's a very complex

1052
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:52,039
complex issue yes do you have a question

1053
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,039
yeah um

1054
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:03,300
all right now I'm going into a piece of

1055
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:05,098
computers uh because we're having sort

1056
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:08,220
of washing problems and some people

1057
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:10,460
saying that this will help with private

1058
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,459
information

1059
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:22,079
what I've heard is not that

1060
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,780
I've heard that farmers that said I've

1061
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,640
tried rotational tillage but found I

1062
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,519
didn't need it

1063
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,799
and they continue with no-till but once

1064
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,199
again I'm I can't be everywhere so

1065
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,019
that's what that's something to look at

1066
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:40,279
I actually I think with no-till with

1067
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:46,019
residue retention you actually have less

1068
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:48,780
subsoil hard pans and and compaction the

1069
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:51,179
compaction comes when you do tillage

1070
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:53,339
yeah so I I

1071
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:55,799
you're from there go and talk to some of

1072
00:48:53,338 --> 00:48:57,719
the farmers there and ask them uh you

1073
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,480
know some farmers down there have been

1074
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:02,399
doing it for 30 40 years

1075
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,679
and what the farmers say there the

1076
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,680
biggest problem was this

1077
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:09,659
in in adopting it the mind

1078
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:12,779
that you know your father say you know

1079
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:15,960
my utilize yield and my grandfather did

1080
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:18,359
it so but now they they do it now the

1081
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,000
big problem is that they are now using

1082
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:23,039
they have to use say they have been

1083
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,099
using herbicide tolerant crops like

1084
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:28,679
soybeans and Maize with glyphosate and

1085
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:31,039
that so there are some issues in that

1086
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:34,399
respect so

1087
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:34,400
thank you very much
