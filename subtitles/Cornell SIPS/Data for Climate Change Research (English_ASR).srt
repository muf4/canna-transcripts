1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,120
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,120
university

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,119
um

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,800
now if i did this the wrong way you

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,638
might say i did because i listened to

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,320
frank rossi when i said i was giving

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,719
this seminar and frank said kind of you

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,800
know not a lot of data you know put a

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,919
few jokes in there so i'm following his

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,560
advice so if it goes awry don't blame me

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,400
blame him um basically what i was going

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,518
to do is really just give a good

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,839
overview of the types of data that go

14
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,238
into climate research and working with

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,239
dave and the number of people here at

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,919
allen you know that that always comes up

17
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,919
where are we getting this data from you

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,399
know the the observed data the data from

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,000
the past the current data that we use

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,359
and then more importantly as we move on

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,359
to it the data we're going to use in the

22
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,558
future so that's kind of a little bit of

23
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,159
background

24
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,519
about my slide

25
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,279
and then just kind of going over the

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,719
contents

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,239
really here that

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,399
the middle part is going to be kind of

29
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,399
short changed but the first part and the

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,239
last part is where i'm going to focus

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,400
most of my effort

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,079
and i'm focusing on the first part in

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,600
this kind of intriguing bullet here

34
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,478
climate gate anyone know the whole

35
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,319
scandal of emails in the research lab in

36
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,079
east anglia and things like that yeah

37
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,319
i'm going to try to shed a little bit of

38
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,719
light on that and really the bottom line

39
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,719
and all of that is you know climate data

40
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,478
have been collected for a number of

41
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,519
years hundreds of years 100 years at

42
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,759
least

43
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,519
but never with the intent of monitoring

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,200
climate change so it's basically data

45
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,438
set that's out there it's been used for

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,359
other purposes had its roots pretty much

47
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,959
in agriculture and it's only now

48
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,000
recently that we've been using these

49
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,478
data to to monitor climate change and

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,078
that has some implications to it and

51
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,519
hopefully i'll i'll bring that out in

52
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,599
some of my talk

53
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,959
and then really in the end what we have

54
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,879
to boil down to is we're trying to

55
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,118
project these climate parameters into

56
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,959
the future 100 years into the future how

57
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,040
can we go about doing that and more

58
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,759
importantly how can we do go about doing

59
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,600
that at the scale that is just right

60
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,519
most of the models we operate on are

61
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,359
these big global

62
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,438
climate models that have kind of one

63
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,479
observation for an area about the size

64
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,560
of new york

65
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
but yet we're interested in can we will

66
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,959
be able to grow grapes in the finger

67
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,958
lakes um in 2100 or will this crop do

68
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,479
well in new york and so forth and so on

69
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,039
so there it's a matter of getting the

70
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,039
size just right

71
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,840
really the whole backbone of the

72
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,840
climate network observed climate network

73
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,759
in the united states is something that's

74
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,800
called the historical climatology

75
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,479
network

76
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,239
and i'm going to use the us as an

77
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,238
example but this is a good example for

78
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,680
pretty much anywhere else in the world

79
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,439
where there is an extensive set of

80
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,400
observed meteorological data going back

81
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,639
100 years so mostly europe same thing in

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
china and russia really these types of

83
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,159
issues and things are things that come

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
up in all of the networks for the u.s

85
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,759
there are approx little over a thousand

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,759
stations in this network to cover the

87
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,199
size of the u.s

88
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,840
the resolution of these data is

89
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:04,479
primarily daily so not hourly data

90
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,800
things like that daily and really it's

91
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,079
measuring three things the daily maximum

92
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,159
temperature the daily minimum

93
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,000
temperature and how much rainfall the

94
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,560
daily precipitation so that's really the

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,120
100 year record we're really confined to

96
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,959
these measurements

97
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,959
many stations almost all of them have

98
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,360
50-year records some have more than 100

99
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,199
years records and like i said before

100
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
never intended to really track climate

101
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,199
change and kind of just to put this into

102
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,519
perspective

103
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,199
um you know the historical climate

104
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,439
network is pretty much the cream of the

105
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,919
cream of these stations if we look at

106
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,840
any old station there's about today

107
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,359
about six thousand eight thousand

108
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,319
somewhere in there depending on where we

109
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,519
are stations that actually record these

110
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,158
observations

111
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,080
if i use a rain gauge as an example if i

112
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,560
took every rain gauge that was

113
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,599
operational in the united states today

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,759
and put them rim to rim okay anyone want

115
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,318
to venture a guess how big of an area

116
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,479
that would cover

117
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,079
go ahead tom rhode island

118
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,000
no not run island

119
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,239
better soccer square

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,560
neil is closer a tennis court

121
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,158
okay we take every rain gauge in the u.s

122
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,080
put them room to rim we got a tennis

123
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,000
court so that kind of gives you an idea

124
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,959
of what we're dealing with here to

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,358
measure

126
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,040
climate change or anything on a national

127
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,719
scale

128
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,680
there's this distribution of these

129
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,680
stations pretty much have good coverage

130
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
across the country kind of sparse in

131
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,680
some of the areas you would expect them

132
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,520
to be sparse but overall a pretty good

133
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,439
coverage

134
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,959
this is what a typical state this is

135
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,120
kind of what a typical station looks

136
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,918
like this is the game farm road station

137
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,840
and really a few extra instruments here

138
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:47,120
but the main ones are this rain gauge

139
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,799
here with a windshield around it and two

140
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,959
temperature sensors and we'll talk about

141
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
that a little bit more later the primary

142
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:57,399
sensor is this one right here which is

143
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,400
called the max min temperature sensor

144
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,040
um

145
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,960
the one thing about the u.s historical

146
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,800
climate network is it's citizen science

147
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,279
in action it's been citizen science

148
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,918
forever these things are pretty much in

149
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,519
people's backyards okay so this is an

150
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,839
example of a station i don't know which

151
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,079
one it is um in the historical climate

152
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,319
network the rain gauge is out of the the

153
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,198
frame but here's the mmts

154
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,959
the network also expands to some um

155
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,800
airport stations so here's the

156
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,799
temperature center of binghamton which

157
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,079
is part of this but for the most part

158
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,079
these are volunteer networks

159
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,840
the weather service is supplying the

160
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,319
instrumentation but the volunteer is

161
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,638
supplying manpower

162
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,120
there are some bad apples and this is

163
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,840
really the crux of climate gate so

164
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,439
here's an example of an mmts that's kind

165
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,119
of in some bushes and right by a big

166
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,038
asphalt parking lot not the best

167
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,360
exposure for measuring temperature

168
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,038
here's an even worse exposure for

169
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,280
measuring temperature that's a burn

170
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,279
barrel i don't know what that looks like

171
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,079
and there's a fair number of these again

172
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,918
a really bad exposure here this is the

173
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,839
temperature sensor up there so i mean

174
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,519
you don't need to be a climatologist to

175
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,959
figure out that these are not good

176
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,959
locations for measuring temperature

177
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,199
however

178
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,199
these few bad apples i mean these are

179
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,960
just the bad examples that i picked out

180
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,759
here what i want to say is they don't

181
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,758
spoil a bunch so if we actually go out

182
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,600
and look at these stations okay and it

183
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,400
was kind of it's kind of

184
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,720
you know

185
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,519
the the sad part about it is when these

186
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,919
stations were selected to be in the us

187
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,318
climate network probably about 30 years

188
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,918
ago 20 years ago nobody went out and

189
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,759
looked at them they looked at the length

190
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,680
of record they looked at the amount of

191
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,479
missing data they never looked at the

192
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,840
sites so that's why these bad apples

193
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,758
are in the bunch but when we look at

194
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,839
this basically the blue line is a

195
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,439
temperature trend over the last

196
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,198
50 or so years

197
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,639
from

198
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,478
the good stations

199
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,639
the bass stations the cream of the crops

200
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,478
the ithacas the the stations that are in

201
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,879
nice pristine environments

202
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,719
the red line is all of the stations so

203
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,279
if we take all of the stations the bad

204
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,599
apples and all and what we can see is

205
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,519
that really those few add bad apples

206
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,598
make some difference in the exact

207
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,839
numbers but overall if we're looking at

208
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,519
the trend we have the same pretty much

209
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,399
magnitude and pattern of trend through

210
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,719
time okay so when

211
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,198
these scientists from east anglia

212
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,639
were criticized for taking some data out

213
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,400
of their analyses

214
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,000
what they were actually doing

215
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,918
was

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,079
separating out the bad apples that occur

217
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,758
not only here but across the globe i

218
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,000
could have taken examples of stations

219
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,598
like this from any country

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,720
again they are the they are the

221
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,719
exceptions rather than the world

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,680
the data are processed in a number of

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,598
different ways and they're processed to

224
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,519
remove

225
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,519
non-climatic things that creep into them

226
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,598
so pretty much the easiest things are

227
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,000
things like quality control and missing

228
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,240
data and urbanization basically here a

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,160
very simple adjustment on the raw data

230
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,038
to adjust for population so something

231
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,360
like a growing city where population is

232
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,918
changing gets adjusted that warming due

233
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,479
to urbanization is removed from the data

234
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:17,120
and again quality control is really my

235
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,120
wall grade sign it's not 501 so things

236
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,280
like that and i mean this is probably a

237
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,598
common error keeping in mind up until

238
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,359
very recently these things were keyed in

239
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,000
from paper form so the observer went out

240
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,598
to the station wrote down a number sent

241
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,918
in his form or her form at the end of

242
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:36,399
the month and somebody digitized these

243
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:41,079
so it's very easy that you know 50.1 got

244
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,080
keyed in as 50 or 501.

245
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,278
the stations are adjusted for

246
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,080
relocations

247
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,399
um

248
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,480
this is the current ithaca station

249
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,399
this is the ithaca station in 1930.

250
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,320
that is the temperature shelter

251
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,919
anyone know what building that is

252
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,000
that's robert hall so the roof of

253
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,120
roberts hall was the official

254
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,799
observation site in the 1930s um a bunch

255
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,360
of other stuff up here was it really

256
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,479
warm back then it was if you look at the

257
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,839
ithaca record the record highs in ithaca

258
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,680
are in the 1930s why it's a black roof

259
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,880
on the top of ramen

260
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,958
okay

261
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,720
a lot a lot different here we're about

262
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,399
at the same level now so kind of if you

263
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,480
want to fact you know think of climate

264
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,039
change that way the roof of roberts hall

265
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,560
and gamefront road are about even

266
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,079
actually back here ithaca was an

267
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,000
official weather service station there

268
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,879
was a weather bureau office in roberts

269
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,720
hall and just as a this thing up here is

270
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,000
actually the signal flag so they they

271
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,440
throw up a flag you know you see a

272
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,360
hurricane flag or something like that

273
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,399
flying there used to be one of those on

274
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,399
the roof of robert's hall

275
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,439
um

276
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,799
the data are adjusted for a change in

277
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,600
instrumentation

278
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,359
basically prior to the mid 1980s the

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,360
temperatures were taken by a maximum

280
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,759
minimum thermometer liquid and glass

281
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,240
enclosed in the stevenson screen

282
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,278
in the mid 1980s most of the stations

283
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,039
not all

284
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,039
moved on to an electric sensor here

285
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,679
which is a thermal couple inside the

286
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,759
mmts so these are the two basically for

287
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,599
the last 100 years these are the only

288
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,838
two types of instruments that you can

289
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,839
use

290
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,759
the data are also adjusted for

291
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,000
observation time

292
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,240
these are once a day observations of

293
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,519
maximum minimum temperature taken by

294
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
volunteers

295
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,679
so i'm an early riser and for me it

296
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,599
might be easier to take my observation

297
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,439
in the morning before i come into work

298
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,320
so if i were doing that and this is my

299
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,800
example of a morning observation if i

300
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,278
was coming in and say i took my

301
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,039
observation at seven am

302
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,200
okay so if i took my observation at

303
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,719
seven am on this morning i would be

304
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,959
looking at the lowest temperature in

305
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,399
this 24-hour period and it just so

306
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,559
happened to occur right when i took the

307
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,480
observation okay so this value is a

308
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,759
little bit colder than that value so

309
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,560
that's my min

310
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,879
i reset my thermometer can only go to

311
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,119
the minimum temperature i can't make it

312
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,120
any more colder or any more warmer then

313
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,560
i come back the next day and throughout

314
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,000
this whole period the temperature has

315
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,479
risen

316
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
okay so when i take my observation here

317
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,680
say what was the minimum temperature in

318
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,519
the last 24 hours

319
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,439
it was over here

320
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,839
so when i take my observations in the

321
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,120
morning i tend to count a particularly

322
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,120
cold morning twice

323
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,639
if i'm the opposite and rather do it

324
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,480
when i come home from work i have the

325
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,240
opposite problem i now take my

326
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,800
observation at the time of day and

327
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,278
whoops looks like mac and pc got messed

328
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,958
up these were supposedly lined up

329
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,120
i take my observation at the time when

330
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,518
the temperature is the warmest so if i

331
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,600
came and i looked at this period of time

332
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,360
this would be my max not that

333
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,240
and then if i came the next day at 5 00

334
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,759
pm i would be counting that max twice so

335
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,799
the same type of thing but but in the

336
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:50,559
afternoon

337
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,879
so the morning observers tend to have a

338
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,399
cold bias the afternoon observers tend

339
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,559
to have a warm bias

340
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,159
and this wouldn't be a problem if

341
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,078
observers were random

342
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,519
but there has been a systematic shift

343
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,278
through time to take morning

344
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,360
observations so there's been an

345
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,519
artificial cooling in the climate record

346
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,519
due to that but really this adjustment

347
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,519
is pretty easy to figure out and it's a

348
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,320
pretty robust adjustment knowing what

349
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,000
the observation time was

350
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,320
so let's look at this this is some

351
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,399
trends in the hcn

352
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,079
but basically how does what is the

353
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,399
difference as we add each of these

354
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,359
adjustments so the green line is just if

355
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,159
we fill in missing data and it's

356
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,079
nothing really there to write home about

357
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,319
the red line is the instrument

358
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:37,439
adjustment so this is when we shifted

359
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,920
from a cotton region shelter to an mmts

360
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,639
in the mid 80s and as you can see that

361
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,599
that caused a very slight warm bias to

362
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,159
the record

363
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,240
the record warmed or our adjustment had

364
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,958
to be toward warming okay i said that

365
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,480
backwards the bias is actually cooling

366
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,479
and this is the adjustment that we need

367
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:00,639
if we look at the change in observation

368
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,799
time again a systematic shift to morning

369
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,799
observations is a cooling so our

370
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,479
adjustment we have to add warming to the

371
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,679
record and there you can see the

372
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,519
magnitude of this is on the order of

373
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,958
degrees f unfortunately but about a

374
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,959
third of a degree apparently

375
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,679
the station moves again

376
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,519
the adjustment is towards warming and

377
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,120
the reason for this is through time

378
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,200
there's been a systematic shift in

379
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,440
having stations in the center of the

380
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,920
city and then moving them out to an

381
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
airport location so baltimore might be a

382
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,799
good example where the station used to

383
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,639
be in the courthouse in the center of

384
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,879
baltimore and it got moved out to the

385
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,560
airport okay that in this case that's a

386
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,078
big enough move that it counts as two

387
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,239
stations but that gives you the general

388
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,439
flavor of these moves so there's a

389
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,600
there's a

390
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,680
cooling or actually the ithaca example

391
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,600
is a good example of that another

392
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,479
systematic shift was from rooftop

393
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,240
locations to ground locations so

394
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,039
there again a cooling in the record that

395
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,879
has to be adjusted

396
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,879
urbanization of course has the opposite

397
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,720
effect and here this population

398
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,879
adjustment is about a tenth of a degree

399
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,160
fahrenheit so really the biggest the

400
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,480
biggest difference there is the

401
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,559
observation time in the station moves

402
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,120
which together are about a half degree

403
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,958
fahrenheit um chris

404
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,039
i don't quite understand if you have a

405
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,719
maximum minimum thermometer either

406
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,319
automatic or

407
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,160
one that you can read the minimum

408
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,160
temperature off it doesn't matter when

409
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,319
the temperature is taken isn't it um so

410
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,919
what's this bias thing i don't quite it

411
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,680
does because they're not electronic

412
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,120
thermometers like a data logger where

413
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,039
you know what everything is at every

414
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,600
hour or every minute of the day so

415
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,319
basically the best analogy i can give to

416
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,480
the the liquid and glass thermometers

417
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,839
and they continue that in the electronic

418
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,600
thermometers it's like a fever

419
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,279
thermometer so you know you take your

420
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,680
temperature with a fever thermometer if

421
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,838
it's 103 it's you know you pull it out

422
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,879
of your mouth it's 103 and it stays at

423
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,800
103 until you shake it down okay so

424
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,679
these thermometers work exactly the same

425
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,519
way it records the highest temperature

426
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,239
that has been recorded since you have

427
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,320
reset it nothing in between does that

428
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,399
make sense yeah but then why wouldn't

429
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,480
you go to something more automatic where

430
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,480
you would know the exact temperature at

431
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,320
a particular moment in time it doesn't

432
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,879
matter when you read it all right and

433
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,000
and the the whole reason there is is

434
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,720
primarily

435
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,799
the federal government is broke and and

436
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,199
devoid on technology are

437
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,120
working on antiquated technology but the

438
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,519
other reason too is you have this big

439
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,078
long record you know 100 year record of

440
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,440
doing it one way the current technology

441
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,359
of electronic thermometers when the

442
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,440
observer goes out to game farm road

443
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,800
there is a readout that basically says

444
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,360
what was the highest temperature that

445
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,240
was recorded in the last 24 hours and

446
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,320
what was the coolest and that's it okay

447
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,278
there have been moves and we'll see to

448
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,040
get away from that in in the today this

449
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:54,039
keep in mind this is my

450
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:54,039
um i forget what it was times past

451
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,480
um the other thing is the u.s

452
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,799
temperature record from measurements

453
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,480
like this very much mirrors the national

454
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,879
uh the global record so if we see the

455
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,159
u.s record kind of a flat period in

456
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:11,679
through the 40s excuse me a rise from

457
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:14,958
the 1900s to about the 1940s a decrease

458
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,479
to about the 1970s increase we see the

459
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,399
same type of thing i have a different

460
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,959
scale here but here's my rise from the

461
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:25,519
1900s to about 1940 i kind of decrease

462
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,599
or flat period in through the 70s and

463
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,600
then my rise so really the u.s record is

464
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,120
a good match to the global record in

465
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,120
looking at these observed temperatures

466
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,320
all right the present

467
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,320
finally last five years or so

468
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,079
the noaa said hey we need to do

469
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,839
something to really monitor climate

470
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,239
change we need a network that really

471
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,480
does this and they've instituted what is

472
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,440
called the climatological reference

473
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
network

474
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,800
this is about 100 stations across the

475
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:57,439
u.s given by the

476
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:00,078
yellow dots one up here in canada

477
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,920
the layout of these dots was done very

478
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,000
scientifically we were involved in some

479
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,240
of the work to say what is the minimum

480
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,838
stations we can put out in the u.s to

481
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,400
get a good measure of what the

482
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,000
temperature trend has been okay so a lot

483
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
of actually the sighting of these

484
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,558
stations the spacing between these

485
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,399
stations is scientifically based

486
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,399
um

487
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,798
a crn station looks like that those are

488
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,600
the two in new york there's one out at

489
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:28,240
the animal science facility in hartford

490
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,480
and there's one down in millbrook okay

491
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,240
um actually the the climate center was

492
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,319
involved in sighting these stations and

493
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,240
it was a real bear particularly in the

494
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,918
northeast because one of the

495
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,558
requirements of these stations and there

496
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,640
was a whole review process is that the

497
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,119
area around the station

498
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,720
could not be expected to change

499
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,719
for 50 years

500
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,720
so we wanted to have game farm road be

501
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,400
one of these stations but when we went

502
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,400
you know one of the review processes was

503
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,640
look at okay what is cornell's plans for

504
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,679
expansion that's the way they planned on

505
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,120
expanding so that automatically mix that

506
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,880
so we were able to do that out in

507
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,639
hartford and this was really hard in the

508
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,880
northeast because number one it couldn't

509
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,200
be on private land it always had to be

510
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,440
on publicly so we had actually a nice

511
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,279
facility out anybody by the venture arm

512
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,400
at george junior i thought that would be

513
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,839
a great location for a site but

514
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,679
georgia university and private land is

515
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,918
publicly i mean it's it's privately held

516
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,000
land so that that got nicked so really

517
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,480
hard especially in the northeast

518
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,640
to site these stations but anyway

519
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,640
rain gates in there electronic sensors

520
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,880
there there's actually three redundant

521
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,480
sensors all looking at the same thing

522
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,799
actually within this

523
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,640
measuring solar radiation measuring wind

524
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,240
there are some things to see if things

525
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,320
are out of whack between the sensors so

526
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,000
they really did this upright to really

527
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,000
monitor climate into the future

528
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,160
and this is like five-minute data chris

529
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,959
so now we don't have this problem

530
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,798
um

531
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,200
and really increasingly a lot of the

532
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:57,200
indians

533
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,279
um

534
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,880
the criteria for citing these

535
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,960
yes they did basically they

536
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,679
you know a lot of argument of where you

537
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,160
put something along the coast right um

538
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,000
but as as long as the coast reflected

539
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,600
that trend in the temperature or needed

540
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,440
to to you know those stations were

541
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,199
looked at and how much did that affect

542
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,640
the u.s trend there was some sighting

543
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,640
there but most of them are actually even

544
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,000
away from large bodies of water rather

545
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,720
than criteria

546
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,200
um now increasingly now our observations

547
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,038
globally us are coming from a remotely

548
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,038
sense platform so we have a nice

549
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,519
satellite record going back from the end

550
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,359
of the 70s and really what i'm trying to

551
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,599
show here is the blue is surface

552
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:44,000
observations and a number of different

553
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,000
satellite platforms and here the trends

554
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,440
that you can make them out are a little

555
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,440
bit different that the slope is

556
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,480
different but yet the same type of an

557
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,320
increase

558
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,240
and just because there's satellites

559
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,240
these same types of problems that creep

560
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,720
into station data also creep in the

561
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,880
satellite the satellite orbits degrade

562
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,759
through time and that has to be adjusted

563
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,520
for um you know changes in atmospheric

564
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,038
moisture might affect the satellite

565
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,200
record so just because it's coming from

566
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,919
a satellite doesn't mean it's devoid of

567
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,558
these types of of things that go on in

568
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,919
the surface and increasingly for for

569
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,599
rainfall

570
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,840
radar is becoming a platform for those

571
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,678
um also a lot of our information and

572
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,839
this is really kind of my transition in

573
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,038
going from global circulation models to

574
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,359
observations

575
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,839
a lot of our observations is we use a

576
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,359
data set that's called the re-analysis

577
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:36,158
in the best way to describe a

578
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,918
re-analysis is it takes all kinds

579
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,799
basically data from any number of

580
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,280
platforms radiosondes weather balloons

581
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,038
aircraft surface observations

582
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,038
satellite how clouds are moving to get

583
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:50,000
an idea of the wind and these are the

584
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:52,000
data that go into um initializing

585
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,279
weather forecast models right so if i

586
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,200
have a gridded model to predict

587
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,639
tomorrow's weather i need to give it its

588
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,720
initial conditions

589
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,440
and these are the types of data that go

590
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,880
into that okay so what has been done is

591
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,919
going back

592
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,600
uh 30 or even in some cases 50 years to

593
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,840
take the observations that go into

594
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,439
initializing these forecasts put them

595
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,000
through a standardized routine so the

596
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,400
routine doesn't change through time okay

597
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,558
and then come up with a gridded data set

598
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,400
that blends all of these platforms

599
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,079
together so it's giving me things like

600
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
precipitation it's giving me things like

601
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,918
surface temperature but it's also giving

602
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,439
me things like wind speed and pressures

603
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,919
and heights and where the highs and lows

604
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,840
are okay much like a global circulation

605
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,240
model does so this

606
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,798
re-analysis data set sort of is going to

607
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,720
or it does provide a benchmark to global

608
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,839
circulation models and i'll show that in

609
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,839
some of my later slides

610
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,759
um all right so the future

611
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,359
um so really what is a climate model

612
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,359
getting to the

613
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,879
to the title of my talk you know like if

614
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,879
i can't get the weather right tomorrow

615
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,880
how do i get the climate right in 100

616
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,400
years so really in a climate model we

617
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,159
have to take this whole big climate

618
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,120
system the atmosphere the sun the

619
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,520
volcanoes the oceans the ice the

620
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,839
greenhouse gases the clouds you know the

621
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,480
agriculture and the land surface and

622
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:13,199
basically turn that into a model

623
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,640
so even though that's a nice picture

624
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,519
whoops

625
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,720
there it comes now basically i'm taking

626
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,879
all of that

627
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,600
and turning it into a lot of computer

628
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,360
okay so basically that is the

629
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,639
crux of the climate model i'm not we're

630
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,359
not going to go through a couple

631
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,440
equations but not too many

632
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,839
um

633
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,840
all right

634
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,558
all right what do i want to say

635
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,399
why do i have lava lamps because i think

636
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,960
again it's just an analogy i was trying

637
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,798
to think i think anybody can say oh if i

638
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,440
turn on the lava lamp

639
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,200
what's going to happen to the lava

640
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,960
it's going to rise in the land okay so

641
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,480
that's the basic physics of what's going

642
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,960
on i'm heating the lava from from the

643
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,200
bottom and it's rising okay but if i

644
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,159
asked a different question you know how

645
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,159
big is each blob of lava as it rises you

646
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,240
know or predict you know

647
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,080
when this guy rises the next one rises

648
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,440
how big is it's going to be nobody's

649
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,678
going to know that's more like the

650
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,679
weather or an example i usually do i

651
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,000
don't have it if i drop the piece of

652
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,200
paper okay i asked you what was if i

653
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,200
asked you to model what was going to

654
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,798
happen to the paper if i let go you'd

655
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,558
all say it's going to fall to the floor

656
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,480
right that's cool that's the climate

657
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,558
okay if i ask you where it was going to

658
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,079
land every time i drop it it's going to

659
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:29,918
land someplace difference and that's

660
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,119
just the chaos and then it's going to be

661
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,520
somewhere different and nobody's going

662
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,678
to be able to do that that's the weapon

663
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,918
so again here in the climate my example

664
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,240
is yes we're looking at if we add

665
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,600
greenhouse gases what is the overall

666
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,120
trend going to do

667
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,038
but really what we don't expect the

668
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,399
model to get are these inter-annual

669
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:47,919
variations

670
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,640
the model doesn't know you know the

671
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,360
model might replicate el nino

672
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,919
but the model has no idea in what year

673
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,599
an el nino is going to occur so maybe in

674
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,000
a hundred years the model will get it

675
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,279
right and there'll be an el nino

676
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,359
you know

677
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,839
every seven years or at the at the

678
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,839
historical rate of el ninos but if it's

679
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,038
going to it's not going to occur

680
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,720
you know you can't look at the model and

681
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:13,200
say oh the model is predicting an el

682
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,798
nino in 2016 you can't expect that to

683
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,640
happen so you won't see where i'm trying

684
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,879
to get at so you know we're getting the

685
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,360
overall trend but the timing of these

686
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,200
types of swiggles is not right or we

687
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,719
can't expect it to be right a good

688
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,319
example of that is the last several

689
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,919
years over the last 10 years we've

690
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,079
actually if you look at a trend it's

691
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,799
been cooling or flat people will say oh

692
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,798
climate change is over we'll know that

693
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,158
that cooling part is we're in one of

694
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:37,918
these valleys

695
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,278
and eventually will come out

696
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,200
so the model is trying to get the

697
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:44,240
overall trend the gross aspects of

698
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,240
things it can't be expected to get heavy

699
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,240
with

700
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,720
okay

701
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,880
models are gridded

702
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,839
basically the whole globe is divided

703
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,559
into a number of grid boxes kind of on

704
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,558
you know resolution changes with time

705
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,319
pretty much state of the art now it's

706
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,720
maybe 100 kilometers on the side a

707
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,798
degree by a degree maybe is a is a good

708
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,880
size global circulation model

709
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,278
grid boxes go up into the atmosphere

710
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,799
grid boxes go down into the ocean but

711
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,880
the idea is you know each of these grid

712
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,798
boxes is a node in the model so there's

713
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,799
one value for each of these grid boxes

714
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:22,079
one value for temperature one value for

715
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,079
elevation you name it

716
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,199
all of the models and there are a number

717
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,038
of different climate models out there

718
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,080
any number of climate groups has their

719
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,079
own model

720
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,158
but yet all of these models share pretty

721
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,720
much a common set of core physical

722
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,520
equations okay they need to conserve

723
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,519
momentum they need to service in a

724
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,519
special case momentum in the verticals

725
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,359
through the hydrostatic equation they

726
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,679
need to conserve mass they need to

727
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,439
conserve the energy and the equation of

728
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,759
state needs to apply to the atmosphere

729
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,360
so at the crux of all these models this

730
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,839
is it these are you know these are the

731
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,199
core

732
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:58,079
equations and we won't go into those too

733
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,000
much

734
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,918
but really where the art

735
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,599
comes into state of the art and climate

736
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,080
model is through how things are

737
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,639
parameterized how do we take care of

738
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,319
things that occur at grits at a scale

739
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,360
that is smaller than the grid scale of

740
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,678
the model

741
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,959
so here a good example and maybe not a

742
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,400
good example i couldn't get a good

743
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,159
picture here is is clouds okay you know

744
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,559
where clouds really matter is that the

745
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,559
scale of the individual drops

746
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,639
if i look at a cloud or you know you sit

747
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,480
in on my cloud physics class but whether

748
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,960
a cloud is going to reflect solar

749
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,038
radiation or allow solar radiation to

750
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,679
pass through or absorb long wave

751
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:38,079
radiation really depends on what are the

752
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,320
sizes of the drops and the sizes of the

753
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,599
drops are like nanometers okay we're

754
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:45,839
small scale here and uh basically what

755
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,599
is the density of those drops so these

756
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,319
are things that are on many orders of

757
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,558
magnitude smaller scale than the model

758
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,960
is able to to take into account keep in

759
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:57,119
mind we have about a degree by a degree

760
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,600
box and we have to say it's cloudy or

761
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,519
it's not soft okay so those types of

762
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,839
things need to be parameterized into the

763
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,918
model and again kind of simple things if

764
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,240
the relative humidity in the model over

765
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,000
the grid box reaches a certain level

766
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,079
it's cloudy or this cloud has this

767
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,159
albedo in it based on that so there are

768
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,079
a number of ways to do it and that's how

769
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,760
one model may differ from another so

770
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,599
that's why my answer might come out to

771
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,679
be different than somebody else's so we

772
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,839
have a spread of solutions going into

773
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,559
the future mainly due to how these are

774
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:26,558
parameterized

775
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,519
um and again there's been a whole

776
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:34,558
evolution through time not only this

777
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,400
these f-a-r-s-a-r-t-a-r are the ipcc

778
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,558
reports so that's the first assessment

779
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,159
report the second um

780
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:41,678
the fourth finally i guess they needed

781
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,520
to do something because the fourth and

782
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,440
the fifth were both gonna be far but

783
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,000
anyway you can see the size of the grid

784
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,919
boxes are going from about about 500

785
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,839
kilometers on the side

786
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,559
in the first assessment report to about

787
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,558
100 kilometers on the side now

788
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,798
the way things are parameterized in the

789
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,879
models has changed dramatically you know

790
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,000
in the 70s there were no clouds you know

791
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,080
if there was enough water in the

792
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,119
atmosphere it rained out and that was it

793
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,278
no clouds um you know even here in the

794
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,038
70s there was no ocean there was just a

795
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,960
lot of water and water was allowed to

796
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,879
evaporate but there was no current there

797
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,880
was no deep circulation in the ocean all

798
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,559
the ocean was was a source of water

799
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,960
vapor for the atmosphere

800
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,879
and then finally as we get

801
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,120
into the recent period of time i mean we

802
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,600
got a really sophisticated model we have

803
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,759
an ocean with a circulation deep

804
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,519
circulation surface circulation

805
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,480
atmosphere chemistry is starting to be

806
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,720
modeled

807
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,519
the vegetation at the surface starts to

808
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,759
interact and is dynamic not just static

809
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,440
through time so a whole evolution in how

810
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,079
these models have

811
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,679
come about and primarily uh the thing

812
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,278
that's that's going on here is an

813
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,519
increase in computing power

814
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,278
really uh right on through this the

815
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,599
models have been pushing the available

816
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,480
computer power

817
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,199
all right

818
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,599
so

819
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,200
kind of going back to how well my models

820
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,959
are doing if you remember the

821
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,440
observations and these are the global

822
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,399
observations we have this period of time

823
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,038
from 1900 to 1920 where the temperature

824
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,719
rises a cooling in through the 40s

825
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,158
through the 70s and then the rise again

826
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,558
so it have kind of this kind of

827
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,080
zigzag pattern

828
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,278
let's see what happens when we try to

829
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,119
model

830
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,159
so one of the nice things about climate

831
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,599
model

832
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,360
is we can play games with the climate

833
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,199
model we can we can in some ways play

834
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:29,439
god we can add greenhouse gases we can

835
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,840
take away greenhouse gases we can make

836
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,759
volcanoes erupt we cannot make volcanoes

837
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,599
erupt we can make the sun brighter we

838
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,079
can make the sun dimmer we can do all of

839
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,240
these things and see how that impacts

840
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:42,879
what the object of the model is so

841
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,440
here's an example again of

842
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,640
my zigzag of temperature

843
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,519
and a climate model that is run with the

844
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,000
only change through this period of time

845
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:56,000
is the change in the greenhouse gases so

846
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,679
the greenhouse gases in the model are

847
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,880
changed according to what has been

848
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,278
observed

849
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,880
and as we can see this red line is the

850
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,440
model

851
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,679
it really doesn't match very well with

852
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,798
the observed pattern that i have and

853
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,159
through here

854
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,359
you know the trend is about right

855
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,440
they're offset missus is cooling totally

856
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,558
and not really getting this right over

857
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,558
here not a good match

858
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,278
do the same thing in this case keep the

859
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,519
greenhouse gases constant

860
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,240
and the only thing change in the model

861
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:30,558
is the change in the natural forces and

862
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,720
here basically volcanic eruptions and

863
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,798
changes in the solar intensity

864
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,120
and if we look at that well if you

865
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,839
notice the model here

866
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,519
again in the red kind of matches a

867
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,839
little bit better here

868
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,000
starts to match a little bit better here

869
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,759
and then we have this rise

870
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,038
and then finally

871
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:53,038
we put it all together okay

872
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,759
have the observations in black and kind

873
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,640
of my general trends in blue to model in

874
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,038
red

875
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,278
and we see that the model at least in my

876
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:04,398
in my view matches the observations

877
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:06,880
fairly well we're able to capture this

878
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,798
warming in the early part of the record

879
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,960
that probably isn't has nothing to do or

880
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,480
very little to do with greenhouse gases

881
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,278
but has everything to do with the sun

882
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,519
being brighter and there being a lack of

883
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,599
volcanic eruptions

884
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,158
we get this cooling

885
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,798
fairly well in through here

886
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,000
50s what's going on there sulfate

887
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:29,278
aerosols okay burning dirty coal acid

888
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,240
rain okay

889
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,720
basically the aerosols that we emit when

890
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,399
we burn coal are reflective so they

891
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,480
reduce the amount of incoming solar

892
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,798
radiation and actually on this global

893
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,960
scale we have a cooling

894
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,639
and then as we get into the 70s this is

895
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,120
the

896
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,759
large increase in greenhouse gases very

897
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,759
little to do with natural variations in

898
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,278
this period of time and also at a time

899
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,278
when we've been cleaning up the coals

900
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,519
sulfate air assaults are becoming less

901
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:00,880
and less and less in most parts of the

902
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,679
world not all parts

903
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,320
so again my example here of a climate of

904
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,960
climate model doing a pretty good job of

905
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,119
of matching the observations really

906
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,278
throughout this whole 100-plus year

907
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,798
period of time

908
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,119
okay

909
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,519
and then finally

910
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,678
how do we get these big

911
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,000
large-scale grid boxes

912
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,399
to come down to a local level

913
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,319
how do we say okay this box here that's

914
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:30,239
the size of new york or almost the size

915
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,359
of new york that has one temperature

916
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,558
value one everything how do we start to

917
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,719
make some

918
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,599
inferences on how climate change will

919
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,399
impact

920
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,879
say the wine industry perhaps water

921
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,879
resources in the new york city watershed

922
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,159
things that happen on a small scale we

923
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,320
don't care about what's going on

924
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,278
globally or even new york size we need

925
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:53,759
to bring these data down to

926
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,319
down to a different level

927
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,879
and just as an example of what i mean

928
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:00,798
this is the united states and this is

929
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,399
the elevation of the united states as

930
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,639
seen by climate model

931
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,398
so you do see the rocky mountains here

932
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,480
and kind of the white but they're no

933
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,518
more than a little hump a little bump on

934
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,599
the map

935
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,599
but if we go down to the scale we really

936
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:15,199
need we want the mountains to look like

937
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,839
that that's the thing that's driving the

938
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,080
snowpack in the west and water resources

939
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,759
in the west not this little

940
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,918
pump in the map

941
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,000
so these types of features start to

942
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,919
become very very important when we want

943
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,960
to look at local scale impacts or even

944
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,960
regional scale impacts

945
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:36,000
so the way we get from one to another is

946
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,159
through a process called downscale and

947
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,960
really here it's an idea of resolving

948
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,640
the mismatch of the scales

949
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,079
show some examples that can be done

950
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,840
statistically

951
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,480
or it can be done dynamically so

952
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,558
basically using a finer scale model to

953
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,240
do the downscale

954
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,319
both of these have their origins in

955
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,919
weather prediction in the current state

956
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,759
of the art is one is no better than the

957
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,960
other they both have their pros and cons

958
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,640
in the end

959
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,360
either one of these is an acceptable

960
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,519
method we've been doing a lot of work

961
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,119
recently in the climate project that

962
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,679
dave and jonathan have been involved

963
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:12,000
with in us over in bradfield really

964
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,519
looking at statistical downscaling but

965
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,960
uh we've been doing some dynamical

966
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,878
downscaling too for things like lake

967
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,918
effect snow that kind of lends itself to

968
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:22,000
that application

969
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,719
just to give you an idea of how this

970
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,519
works in weather forecasting okay

971
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,398
this is the results from last week of

972
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:33,039
the eas weather forecasting contest

973
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:35,679
and a bunch of these are students but

974
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,398
basically what i wanted to show is the

975
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,559
best forecast here is basically through

976
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,719
a statistical downscaling

977
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,960
okay so it's a totally statistical

978
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,638
forecast this has no no person is

979
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,199
involved okay it comes right off the

980
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,000
computer and that's actually doing quite

981
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,439
well

982
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,639
it's beating me

983
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,519
okay

984
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,280
um

985
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,199
and that's a consensus so this is a

986
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,920
number of these different statistical

987
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,159
approaches here's a particular

988
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,838
statistical approach and again it's

989
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,159
doing fairly well

990
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:08,480
um brian is our computer guru and he

991
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:10,639
runs the dynamical model basically takes

992
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,920
the forecast right from the model again

993
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,920
the models

994
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,079
so this idea of down scaling from a

995
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,119
model to the game farm road weather

996
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,680
station

997
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,160
now it's it's we see it in action

998
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:24,159
in weather forecasts and my argument

999
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,559
here is either i'm doing pretty poorly

1000
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,838
or it does it it's doing pretty well in

1001
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,440
this case for the

1002
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:33,358
semester notice where my sake is if

1003
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,880
anybody knows

1004
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:36,719
who's your humanoid

1005
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,320
uh i'm one of the one of the undergrads

1006
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,559
so

1007
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,559
um

1008
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,519
anyway um you know so if we look at

1009
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,279
statistical downscaling first

1010
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,519
really the biggest pro is it's

1011
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,320
computationally inexpensive it's easy to

1012
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,880
do or relatively easy to do

1013
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,280
um we can tailor it

1014
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,280
to specific variables we can look at

1015
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,920
some exotic things things that aren't

1016
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,640
even in the climate models storm surges

1017
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,800
air quality perhaps

1018
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:08,639
can be made site specific

1019
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,359
but the downsides is you know the

1020
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,039
biggest downside perhaps

1021
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:15,039
is it's not describing the physical

1022
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,199
process so we're making a big leap of

1023
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,639
faith that whatever we're basing our

1024
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,559
statistics on

1025
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,598
isn't changing in the future right so

1026
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:23,199
we're saying okay whatever the

1027
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,200
relationship we're looking at today or

1028
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:26,480
basing our model on today is going to

1029
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,639
hold in the future

1030
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,119
and that may or may not be a good

1031
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,118
assumption

1032
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,639
the simplest way to do this is just to

1033
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,039
say okay

1034
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:40,000
i use this in providence basically if i

1035
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,838
want to look at providence annual precip

1036
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,838
and i look at the gcm grid that

1037
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,719
encompasses

1038
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:49,119
providence and i strike a regression

1039
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,039
and it's not a one-to-one relationship

1040
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,039
if it were perfect but it's somewhere

1041
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:56,320
off of the one-to-one line and i can use

1042
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:58,480
that as my downside not very

1043
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,000
not very uh

1044
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,920
i don't want to say too much about that

1045
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,400
still a way to do it

1046
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,720
um looking at some of the more common

1047
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,559
ways that are doing this in the new york

1048
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,919
assessment again that dave and jonathan

1049
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,119
and some others in the room have been

1050
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,358
involved with

1051
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,440
they use what's called a delta method

1052
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,519
and basically here we have an observed

1053
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,280
distribution of temperature

1054
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,119
in this case our observed period is from

1055
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,440
70 to 2000.

1056
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,960
and we have what the model says

1057
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,320
is the observed distribution of

1058
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,240
temperature for that particular point

1059
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,720
in the same period of time

1060
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,199
and they don't match up

1061
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,519
okay and then we have what the model is

1062
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,199
saying the temperature is at some point

1063
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:42,320
time in the future

1064
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:44,879
and the delta becomes the model present

1065
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,920
minus the model future so this blue area

1066
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,079
there

1067
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,240
and then that delta is applied back to

1068
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,079
the data so in other words here are my

1069
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:54,319
daily observations from say of

1070
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,920
temperature from say rochester

1071
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,880
from 1970 and to each day all i do is

1072
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,519
add this delta so if this delta were 5

1073
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,480
degrees each observation here gets

1074
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:08,400
inflated by five degrees again a fairly

1075
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,639
simple method of doing it

1076
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,119
the biggest drawback in my mind is the

1077
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,199
variability of the climate never changes

1078
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,920
if it was cold on this day

1079
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,519
relatively cold on this day in 1970 it's

1080
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,480
going to be relatively cold on that day

1081
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:22,320
and

1082
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,079
in the future model just five degrees

1083
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,480
warmer so the same progression of

1084
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:30,400
temperature changes stays

1085
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,400
it just gets translated upward

1086
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,039
um

1087
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,720
some more sophisticated methods actually

1088
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,519
look at the whole distribution of

1089
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,399
temperature and allows delta to change

1090
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:42,960
not

1091
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,800
defines delta not just at the median or

1092
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,960
the average but across the whole

1093
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,760
distribution so this would be my example

1094
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,760
here of perhaps in the green and

1095
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,920
observed here we have a cumulative

1096
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,560
distribution function on percentage of

1097
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,280
observations here in green and how does

1098
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:01,519
the delta change at each of these nodes

1099
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,560
and maybe the model is cooler at the

1100
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:06,000
very low end and maybe it's higher at

1101
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,920
the very high end and maybe there's a

1102
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,159
large difference in the middle so each

1103
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,159
of these are taking into account and

1104
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,639
therefore we can start to adjust days

1105
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:16,159
differently depending on how hot or cold

1106
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,358
they are

1107
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,358
i'm going to skip the next one

1108
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,319
another way to do this

1109
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,800
is to look at a greater suite of

1110
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,960
predictors to use all this information

1111
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,839
that the climate models give us things

1112
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,079
like you know what is the 500 millibar

1113
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:36,480
height i think of a weather map how what

1114
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,079
are the winds doing the law so use all

1115
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,358
this whole you know if you think of if i

1116
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,240
ask you

1117
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:42,880
um

1118
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,639
you know if i told you

1119
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,320
from the model it was going to be cloudy

1120
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:49,118
today and there was going to be a trough

1121
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,960
over new york you know would you say

1122
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,920
even basic weather would you say it's

1123
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,240
going to be a hot day or a warm day

1124
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,320
let's try that again a hot day or a cold

1125
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,399
day a cool day right a trough is

1126
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,640
generally cool clouds we don't have any

1127
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,880
sun so that type of broad scale

1128
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,480
information kind of gets some some

1129
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,280
information

1130
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,838
so where do i want to go with that

1131
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,000
here's an example of downscaling using

1132
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:15,679
this for snowpack

1133
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,480
okay so this is some work that we've

1134
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,399
done

1135
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,400
where lots of lines here probably not

1136
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,800
the best graph to show

1137
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,320
on the screen the black line is the

1138
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,519
historical

1139
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
snow depth

1140
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,759
at

1141
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,760
wanakina ranger station in the

1142
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,839
adirondacks okay

1143
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,960
the blue line

1144
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:37,519
is basically a climate model that we

1145
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,800
have downscaled to that particular

1146
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,800
location

1147
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,880
so i would argue that in my blue line

1148
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,200
we're doing pretty good in getting the

1149
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,960
maximum

1150
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:49,358
average snow depth this over a period of

1151
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,358
time so in any average year you would

1152
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,119
expect there to be at least 20 inches of

1153
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,279
snow on the ground

1154
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,200
pretty much getting the timing fairly

1155
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,200
good in the beginning in the end we're

1156
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:01,519
losing our snowpack at least the similar

1157
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:04,159
rate our timing's off by a few by about

1158
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:07,280
a week or two but we basically replicate

1159
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:10,159
this fairly well in the downscale

1160
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,880
the purple the mustard and the red are

1161
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,679
the model run on this station

1162
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,838
through

1163
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,799
into the future so we've downscaled the

1164
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:22,400
data from the gcm for the 20s the 50s

1165
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,920
and the 80s we see in the in the 20s the

1166
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,000
purple line

1167
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,880
we reduce our snowpack a little bit not

1168
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,679
much

1169
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,000
and we kind of shorten our snow season

1170
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:34,639
there but it's really not until the 50s

1171
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,400
and the 80s that we really see dramatic

1172
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,960
increases in the snow depth of this

1173
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,200
station based on this downscaling

1174
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,280
basically going from on average

1175
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:45,039
20 inches to on average about four

1176
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,319
inches of snow at this adirondack

1177
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,199
location

1178
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,880
also notice not too much change in

1179
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:53,519
what's going on at the beginning of the

1180
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,519
season when we start to accumulate snow

1181
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,679
but a dramatic change at the end of the

1182
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,318
season for when we lose the snowpack

1183
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,799
basically from mid mid may to actually

1184
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:05,039
early april and when the snowpack comes

1185
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,318
out so again a technique that can be

1186
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,199
used

1187
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:11,039
for downscaling

1188
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,358
dynamical downscaling we're using

1189
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:15,599
basically a model in a model

1190
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,639
so it's keeping the physics but it's

1191
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,039
very computationally expensive

1192
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:24,078
so as an example

1193
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:26,559
if i wanted to focus in on the us

1194
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,359
what i would do is have a small area

1195
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,358
just over the u.s float kind of cut it

1196
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,039
out like a patchwork quilt

1197
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,960
and basically

1198
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,480
the world is going to end at these

1199
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,159
boundaries

1200
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,559
but in each of the boundaries what's

1201
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,480
going to be fed in are conditions from

1202
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,119
the global circulation model

1203
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,519
so those global grids basically are

1204
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,760
feeding what's going on in this in this

1205
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:52,159
inner model and in this inner model we

1206
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,680
can start to get the resolution down to

1207
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:56,159
the things that might resolve the

1208
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:59,719
adirondacks and the lakes and things

1209
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,719
along those lines

1210
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,960
and as an example

1211
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,078
kind of is showing a number of different

1212
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,519
approaches

1213
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,440
this is

1214
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:11,280
obviously the northeast

1215
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,599
these are data out of the northeast

1216
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,319
climate impacts assessment by

1217
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,559
heyho eddal and the ed al is dave wolf

1218
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:20,318
and i was involved with that and a

1219
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,960
number of other people at cornell so

1220
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:25,838
this is a report that preceded the

1221
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,760
climate report and we're looking at uh

1222
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:28,639
precipitation here i believe in this

1223
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,720
graphic

1224
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,199
and in in panel e

1225
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:35,358
these are the stations and basically the

1226
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,358
the blues are showing different levels

1227
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:38,838
of precipitation

1228
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:41,119
given by the

1229
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:43,358
scale h

1230
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,838
on the other hand

1231
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,519
are is the precipitation from a global

1232
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:50,159
circulation model so that's why we have

1233
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:53,280
these big patches each of these boxes is

1234
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:56,078
one of the grids from the model

1235
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,880
the f is if we down scale this with a

1236
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,960
dynamical model okay so feed this

1237
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,119
information into a finer scale model you

1238
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,119
can get an idea of what the grid size is

1239
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,119
from these boxes and you can see we

1240
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,599
start to pick up more of the detail you

1241
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,519
can see the adirondacks and their effect

1242
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,838
toward higher precipitation you can see

1243
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,838
some of that down in the catskills as

1244
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,759
well you can see some of the mountains

1245
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:19,039
or graphic precipitation coming out in

1246
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,640
new england

1247
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,639
and then finally

1248
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,519
in this panel here this is a

1249
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:26,960
statistically downscaled simulation of

1250
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,519
the same data so all of these are

1251
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,760
showing the same thing stations global

1252
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:34,719
model dynamically downscaled

1253
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,800
statistically downscaled and here this

1254
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:39,118
is downscaled to about an eighth of a

1255
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,400
degree resolution better than this and

1256
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,480
again kind of picking up the adirondacks

1257
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,838
catskills actually our highest rainfall

1258
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,679
in new york

1259
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:49,279
is right around here in the new york

1260
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:50,799
city watershed that comes out very

1261
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,880
nicely

1262
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,039
up and down the mountains of

1263
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,720
vermont

1264
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,199
and i think

1265
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:00,078
i will open it up for some questions

1266
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:03,759
here

1267
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:06,800
in the last slide that you had

1268
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,720
so in g it looks like connecticut gets a

1269
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,519
lot more rain

1270
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,838
um but but it doesn't

1271
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:17,759
you know in the large model in h and

1272
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:19,279
then the other one in f so why

1273
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,880
you know it seems like it's fairly

1274
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,720
consistent with new york but all of a

1275
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,720
sudden connecticut but not

1276
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,000
in new jersey you know and so that's

1277
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:28,639
just

1278
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,239
aspect of the model i guess again aspect

1279
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:31,759
of the model um

1280
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,318
basically probably some coastal

1281
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,160
influences there if you actually look if

1282
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:38,880
we actually looked at the observations

1283
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:41,279
of sport as sparse as they are

1284
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,358
um you know basically you have this

1285
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,079
larger connecticut and the observations

1286
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:48,400
look a lot like most of new york except

1287
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,640
except the high peaks of the adirondacks

1288
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,880
so in this case this statistical method

1289
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,519
does make a little bit more sense that

1290
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,880
way rather than this keeping in mind i'm

1291
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,639
cheating a little bit there because

1292
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,838
these observations are driving the

1293
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:02,078
statistics

1294
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:03,838
they're not driving the dynamical model

1295
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,680
here in this case

1296
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,318
and again an example of this being used

1297
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:10,879
in real time if you watch again going

1298
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:13,358
going from climate to weather if if you

1299
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,519
watch any of the local weather you know

1300
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:17,440
weather casts on tv where they kind of

1301
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,119
have their own they basically are

1302
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,639
running their own mini model especially

1303
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,119
now that it's getting the lake effect

1304
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:24,239
season you know a big national forecast

1305
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,640
model that's not going to get the lake

1306
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,479
effect but these smaller models that can

1307
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:30,400
resolve the lake and resolve the

1308
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,240
temperatures of lake will get that so

1309
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,119
that's what's being used on this small

1310
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:34,879
scale

1311
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,480
by the tv meteorologists and actually

1312
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,358
the weather service offices around new

1313
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,519
york

1314
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:40,719
so that that type of information is

1315
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:43,440
there in

1316
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:45,679
none of the global circulation models is

1317
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,679
are the great lakes included or i take

1318
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,519
that back one or two so if we're looking

1319
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,960
at something like grey lakes that is

1320
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:53,759
just something that is falling through

1321
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,440
the cracks in these models and then even

1322
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,800
as we get down to the smaller scale if

1323
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,800
we're looking at things like what might

1324
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,440
be going on in the finger lengths

1325
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,119
it's in most of the finest scale models

1326
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,358
they're you know the finger lights

1327
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,280
themselves are one grid box so it's

1328
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:10,078
really tough even there to look at that

1329
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,079
type of effect so we really have a scale

1330
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,000
effecting going here now if we wanted to

1331
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,640
look at what's going to be going on

1332
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,400
right in the lakes um we have to

1333
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:20,078
basically take the models that are out

1334
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,800
there and actually increase the

1335
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,480
resolution to get the lakes because the

1336
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,920
lakes are just

1337
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,000
just

1338
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,680
just too small to be resolved if they

1339
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,519
were a little bit bigger they would be

1340
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:32,480
nicely in there but

1341
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:34,639
their

1342
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,280
current size doesn't match up with

1343
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:38,279
the greeting in these models

1344
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:43,358
yeah i'm not sure how to ask this

1345
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:45,199
actually but if you go backwards in this

1346
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:47,920
in this process you're talking about

1347
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:50,559
this an amazing increase in computing

1348
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,680
power needs to do the global climate

1349
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,679
model

1350
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:55,598
yet most people

1351
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,318
yeah okay that's interesting but i want

1352
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,079
to know what with 100 certainly what the

1353
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:01,679
weather is going to be a week from today

1354
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,720
because i've got a wedding to go to with

1355
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,679
that

1356
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:07,439
right so is the computing power that

1357
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,199
we're getting for the global climate

1358
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,838
model uh

1359
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:15,279
filtering down to these more local and

1360
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:18,078
shorter term situations

1361
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,680
it is to a certain degree but i mean the

1362
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,800
bad news is you're never going to get

1363
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,719
100 accuracy because it's just the the

1364
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,039
chaos in the system now you can have as

1365
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,959
much computing power as you want but the

1366
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:31,119
solutions to the equations that you need

1367
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,760
to solve and in the real world are in

1368
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,760
some cases you know they have multiple

1369
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,359
solutions or you know you have you know

1370
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,720
the idea of a butterfly flapping its

1371
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:40,880
wings and you go off in another

1372
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:43,279
direction you're never going to have the

1373
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,240
observations at a at a fine enough

1374
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,040
density to resolve all of that to get it

1375
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,719
so you get down to a level it's it's not

1376
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:51,838
so much the computing power but the

1377
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,759
opposite you know you need to have the

1378
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:55,358
observations to

1379
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,960
you know garbage in garbage out if you

1380
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:58,558
don't have the observations at the scale

1381
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,079
but things are happening you're not

1382
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,160
going to be able to initialize the model

1383
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,160
at those scales and even there the

1384
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:06,318
equations can go awry with a with a

1385
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:08,719
small tweak

1386
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:11,119
where what is done both in the weather

1387
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:13,279
scale and also the climate scale is

1388
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,880
using what are called ensembles

1389
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,359
so in other words i can and that's where

1390
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,079
the computing power comes in i can take

1391
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:22,078
my initialization of the model and tweak

1392
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,000
it a little bit to say i'm not exactly

1393
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,160
sure what the state of the atmosphere

1394
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,679
looks like right now so i'm going to say

1395
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:29,039
up it could look like this it could look

1396
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:31,118
like that it could look like something

1397
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,480
else and in each of those cases i'm

1398
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,079
going to use that as an initial

1399
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,318
condition to my model

1400
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,318
and then as i modeled it into the future

1401
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:40,318
the idea is if you know the initial

1402
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,318
state makes a big difference the models

1403
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:44,318
are going to diverge and then i can say

1404
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:46,558
chris flip a coin for your wedding but

1405
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:48,480
if the if the if the divergent you know

1406
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,960
if the models are close together that

1407
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,199
gives you some increase in certainty in

1408
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,639
your forecast so i mean a lot i know i

1409
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,879
see marty in the back a lot of times

1410
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:58,318
when when when we do the turf call you

1411
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,079
know i'll say i don't have any

1412
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:02,159
confidence in what's going to happen a

1413
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,440
week from now and then some weeks i say

1414
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:06,879
yeah it looks pretty good it's going to

1415
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:09,039
be hot it's going to be dry and kind of

1416
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,119
what we're looking at there is you know

1417
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,960
are these ensembles going off in

1418
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,519
different directions or are they all

1419
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,358
converging on the same solution

1420
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:19,358
do the same thing with the climate model

1421
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:21,440
and there you can not so much tweak the

1422
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:23,279
initial conditions but one what's done

1423
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,920
there is really the thing that's driving

1424
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,680
the differences there are how the models

1425
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,119
are parameterized so are clouds going to

1426
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:31,039
make a big difference and is this guy

1427
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,680
doing the clouds better than somebody

1428
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:36,159
else so an ensemble of climate models

1429
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:38,239
tends to be basically just different

1430
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:40,399
models or slightly different models to

1431
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:41,759
see how that progresses out so

1432
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,920
you know you never see you're never

1433
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,599
going to see in 2100 that this is what

1434
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,280
the temperature is going to be it's

1435
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,359
going to be a range of temperatures to

1436
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,040
give the idea of uncertainty can you

1437
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:53,358
have a question yeah with respect to the

1438
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:55,759
duration of the snowpack particularly

1439
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:59,199
higher latitude do the models take into

1440
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,520
consideration albedo changes

1441
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,519
um

1442
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,160
yes and no

1443
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:09,118
um i guess i'll ask you a question which

1444
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:11,039
models are we talking about

1445
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,680
so

1446
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:16,480
at the global scale yes

1447
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:18,558
um and these dynamical models yes so if

1448
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,240
you know in a dynamic model if it's you

1449
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,240
know even if we're at a small

1450
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:23,439
one kilometer two kilometer grid if it's

1451
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,078
snowing more

1452
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,679
um yes i mean that is clearly

1453
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,039
one of the main things that will be

1454
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:31,039
driving those models is what is the

1455
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:33,358
albedo and that will be related to the

1456
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,119
snowpack when we get into a statistical

1457
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:36,799
model you know there is no there isn't

1458
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,400
that give and take there in that case

1459
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,920
it's basically

1460
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,639
at the large scale this is what it's

1461
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,920
predicting and albedo is you know part

1462
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:45,279
of that

1463
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,559
um

1464
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,480
and it goes from there does that answer

1465
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,240
the question yeah more or less uh

1466
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,880
with respect to you know discussions

1467
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:54,879
about foreign station on a large global

1468
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,880
scale um

1469
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,920
apparently albedo is

1470
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,599
one consideration sure

1471
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,358
right and that's i mean

1472
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,440
yes that's clearly something that's

1473
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:07,279
that's used in the models i mean

1474
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,079
actually we do in my climate change

1475
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,200
class we read a paper where they have

1476
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,280
they they

1477
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:14,639
at far estate a large part of canada and

1478
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,079
the idea is that well that should draw

1479
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:18,480
down co2 and it should be a good thing

1480
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,160
for climate change but in the end what

1481
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,358
it does is you're taking you know

1482
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:22,799
they're doing this on the prairies that

1483
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:24,558
are normally snow covered in the winter

1484
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,720
so what you're doing is taking wind snow

1485
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,640
cover and putting coniferous forest

1486
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,039
which has is absorbing a lot of

1487
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:33,358
radiation so basically the radiation

1488
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:35,759
effect absorbing that radiation equals

1489
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,440
the same amount of warming that you get

1490
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,119
you know by removing the greenhouse so

1491
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,039
it's a balance in the end

1492
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,720
due to that so you know that is one of

1493
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:45,519
the neat things about the models that

1494
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:48,399
you can you can do those exercises and

1495
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:50,559
do those thought experiments

1496
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,599
clearly when the models are run

1497
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,119
for these big ipcc reports

1498
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,240
the runs take

1499
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,480
years to run so the runs for the current

1500
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,519
the next ipcc report

1501
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,280
are actually

1502
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:06,000
being ginned up now

1503
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,920
a lot of the runs for these ice the next

1504
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,400
round of ipcc reports will be done at

1505
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,039
in not the entire globe but in a large

1506
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,119
portion of the globe at a very fine

1507
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:19,119
resolution it will almost be like not

1508
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,280
dynamically down scaling but actually

1509
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,838
running the global models that select

1510
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,119
locations at a very very fine scale the

1511
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:27,279
usb

1512
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,440
so it's going to be a very different you

1513
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,680
know as the models increase we'll see a

1514
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,318
very different flavor to the kind of

1515
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,838
ipcc reports that'll come out in the in

1516
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:38,960
the future it'll be much more down to a

1517
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,960
little bit regional level

1518
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,480
you you showed us why uh you can make

1519
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,880
much better predictions on climate than

1520
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,760
a weather forecast

1521
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,280
but when you start downscaling as you

1522
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,119
describe

1523
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,519
do you introduce

1524
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,680
a lot of noise in that manner so that

1525
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:02,960
the predictions you're making for let's

1526
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,719
say ithaca versus syracuse become

1527
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,679
almost the same kind of noise as your

1528
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:08,679
weather forecasting knows

1529
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:23,679
yes and no i mean what i want to say is

1530
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:27,598
where it doesn't become the noise

1531
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:29,358
is if you're representing a key process

1532
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:32,800
if you're dying if you're dynamically

1533
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:34,078
downscaling okay and let's use the lakes

1534
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,559
as an example

1535
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,240
so let's say i care about like how lake

1536
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,240
effect snow is going to change or even

1537
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:42,159
in the forecast i care about whether

1538
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:44,000
there's going to be lake effect snow

1539
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,078
the fact that i'm putting those lakes in

1540
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,719
there and allowing you know physically

1541
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,440
modeling that process

1542
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,399
i'm getting a lot of signal there

1543
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,838
if we're going

1544
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,280
if we're taking the lakes out and just

1545
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:58,078
saying okay how is the temperature going

1546
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:01,680
to vary between maybe not i'll not pick

1547
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:03,599
on syracuse it's binghamton so to speak

1548
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:05,679
so there really it's just noise there's

1549
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,200
not a big driving physical mechanism

1550
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:08,960
that would make that change like would

1551
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,000
be in lake effect my answer was going to

1552
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,720
be yes

1553
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,719
that makes sense

1554
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,079
this is a real local application

1555
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,079
question okay

1556
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:21,079
i think the journal gets information on

1557
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,079
weather

1558
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:27,039
i believe their forecasts come from a

1559
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,519
private forecasting company in state

1560
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:32,558
college pennsylvania

1561
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:32,559
they don't get it from us

1562
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:37,679
we a long time ago we used to i mean

1563
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:39,118
same type of thing when i was at rutgers

1564
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:40,639
many moons ago

1565
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,960
meteorology department there used to

1566
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:45,199
forecast local paper but as

1567
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,519
the media markets have gotten more uh

1568
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:49,039
global and national olympic companies

1569
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,318
involved going through these companies

1570
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,400
there is no

1571
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:56,079
the only thing that might come that does

1572
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,079
come in the journal is the observations

1573
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,880
so

1574
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,880
that's unfortunate

1575
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:21,358
yeah it's on the you portal too yeah so

1576
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:23,118
what on the cornell site okay yeah

1577
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:24,639
all right

1578
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,720
i think you got a question question from

1579
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:30,239
geneva go ahead

1580
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:32,879
yeah i've heard cases where there's uh

1581
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:35,519
suggestions that the night temperatures

1582
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,480
will warm more than day temperatures

1583
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:40,639
in the future uh can you talk about

1584
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,798
about that is that is that always going

1585
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:45,759
to be the case or and what what's the

1586
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:47,039
basis of that

1587
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,880
um

1588
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:51,519
that is definitely true in the

1589
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,000
observations any of the models do show a

1590
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:56,239
warming of of nighttime temperatures

1591
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,280
relative to daytime temperatures

1592
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:00,078
um

1593
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,839
you know it's not what it is not

1594
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:04,000
is the fact you know we're always

1595
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:05,679
radiating energy so it's not the fact

1596
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,119
that you know at night time we're not

1597
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:10,318
getting any sunlight so we're just

1598
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:12,798
radiating energy um really there it is a

1599
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:14,558
combination most of the the change in

1600
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:16,880
nighttime temperature i believe has to

1601
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,200
do actually with more land use change

1602
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,838
and things like that where um you know

1603
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,598
urbanization and and and

1604
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,279
things along those lines even just

1605
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,200
buildings and things like that have a

1606
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,280
higher heat capacity so the heat is

1607
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:32,480
being stored more at the day and then

1608
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,480
being given off at night

1609
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:41,558
that answer your question alan

1610
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:41,558
yeah thanks

1611
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:46,719
so tomorrow is the election

1612
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:51,199
i've heard

1613
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,440
quite a few uh republican politicians

1614
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:56,000
the last couple weeks saying that this

1615
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,280
whole thing is just a liberal hoax to

1616
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,318
you know

1617
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,760
get more

1618
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:01,039
votes or

1619
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,960
do you

1620
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:06,318
do you think the modeling

1621
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:09,119
will ever reach a level or there is

1622
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:11,039
some number of data points or some

1623
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,720
margin of error that we will get to that

1624
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:15,119
will

1625
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:16,318
convince skeptics that this is really

1626
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,358
happening

1627
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:18,318
no

1628
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:21,039
i mean

1629
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,719
and i'm not saying that

1630
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,558
i am a climatologist

1631
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:26,480
uh the reason that i'm saying that is

1632
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,240
there'll always be uncertainty i mean

1633
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,880
there always isn't

1634
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:32,798
and um i think it's not an issue of

1635
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:37,039
whether the science is correct or

1636
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:39,119
accurate or not um in my in my opinion

1637
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:40,719
it's it's an issue of what do we have to

1638
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,400
do to correct the problem and the

1639
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:43,358
solution to the problem

1640
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,720
is

1641
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:48,798
not appealing um it will require drastic

1642
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:51,039
changes in the way we do business and

1643
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:52,880
operate society and things like that and

1644
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:54,639
and that's the thing that in my mind

1645
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,599
drives the politics

1646
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:59,759
and the sides of things and you know

1647
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:02,000
where it becomes tough is you know it is

1648
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,839
hard to say and if you know

1649
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,318
if i'm along the coast and i'm new york

1650
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:09,039
city and i'm pretty darn you know there

1651
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:10,798
you know sea level rise

1652
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:12,558
the error bars there are getting smaller

1653
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,480
and smaller smaller you have a big

1654
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,559
problem that's a lot of money you know i

1655
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,240
i need to solve that problem if i'm here

1656
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,599
in upstate new york talking to neil in

1657
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:20,399
minnesota

1658
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,240
you know

1659
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,599
maybe a few degrees of warming you know

1660
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,879
there's opportunities so there's going

1661
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,440
to be winners and losers so you have

1662
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,760
that that part of thing too but if we're

1663
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,240
looking collectively as a globe

1664
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,000
uh clearly the problem is there the

1665
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:36,959
solution to the problem of global

1666
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,440
warming is in my mind also the solution

1667
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,960
to a lot of the other world's problems

1668
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,639
and you know that whole thing should be

1669
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:47,480
packaged together and coming up with

1670
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:47,480
solutions so does that take home voting

1671
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:55,519
perhaps we should end it there

1672
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,519
let's thank art again

1673
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:05,960
this has been a production of cornell

1674
