1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:31,288
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:35,480
University translate that has the

3
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,950
potential to change final yield and

4
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:40,890
effect and how we manage our

5
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,030
agricultural acres worldwide today I'm

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,160
going to speak to you about how in the

7
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,260
soils lab or looking identify regions of

8
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,779
the wheat genome that implement are

9
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:51,179
implemented in affecting kernel weight

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,850
and size and their potential for being

11
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,920
introduced into elite varieties so

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,980
cereal crop yields can simply be modeled

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,289
as the spikes for area by the kernels

14
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,390
per spike and by the wait for kernel and

15
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,368
considering the economic importance of

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,840
yield there have been countless genetic

17
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:08,728
associations looking into these

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,959
different yield components but there's

19
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:12,060
been less success in actually

20
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,700
identifying the causal variants and

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,590
implementing them in variety x' part of

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,509
that is due to the fact that the wheat

23
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,969
genome is very large and hexaploid and

24
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,799
also that yield itself is a quantitative

25
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:25,938
trait it's controlled by many small

26
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,380
effect variants across the genome and

27
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:30,388
even these three simplifications

28
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,218
illustrated here are quantitative traits

29
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:34,319
themselves that are often negatively

30
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:36,269
correlated considering this it's

31
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,590
important when we're studying yield to

32
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:40,108
break it down into its individual

33
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,929
components looking specifically at

34
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:44,809
kernel way in kernel morphology this is

35
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:47,310
largely controlled by the grain filling

36
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,200
characteristics such as how long a

37
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,539
variety of is photosynthetically active

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,399
in the field as well as the physical

39
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:55,289
parameters of the kernels themselves

40
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,058
such as their length and their width and

41
00:01:55,289 --> 00:02:01,709
those are both under independent genetic

42
00:01:57,058 --> 00:02:04,888
control um when we're developing a new

43
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:06,450
variety the kernel weight and shape are

44
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:08,908
important traits to consider because

45
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,810
they both can impact I can mention final

46
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:13,620
yields but also the flour yield which is

47
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,209
both going to be bottom

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,549
Namah client's for a grower and a mill

49
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:21,269
and selecting variety returning though

50
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:24,180
to the more elusive characterization of

51
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:26,039
the genes that underlie these traits the

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,959
wheat community has recently had some

53
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,729
the release of new tools that are going

54
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,489
to allow us to go beyond QTL

55
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:33,899
associations and actually pursue fine

56
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,408
mapping and cloning of those traits

57
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,060
those include the release of a fully

58
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:42,239
annotated wheat reference sequence

59
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,519
genome as well as the prospects of gene

60
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,890
editing and tools like CRISPR we can

61
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,769
pursue the fine mapping and positional

62
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:52,199
cloning of yield components the wheat

63
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,819
cap or coordinated agricultural project

64
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,949
aims to do just this

65
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:58,649
it's a concerted effort across 15

66
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:00,479
land-grant universities to identify

67
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,789
genes that control different yield

68
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,889
components and then implement them in to

69
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:06,239
meet breeding programs

70
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:08,039
Cornell is a part of this effort and

71
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,780
specifically in the sorro's lab we're

72
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:14,128
looking to identify genes that impact

73
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,750
kernel weight and kernel shape to do

74
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:17,759
this we're using a by parental

75
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,549
population across between the spring

76
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:23,189
wheat variety is w seven nine eight four

77
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:26,400
or synthetic W seven nine eight four and

78
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:28,109
OPM 85 and those have formed mapping

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,969
reference populations we have access to

80
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:31,650
double tap lloyd's as well as the large

81
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:34,439
population of recombinant inbred lines

82
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,389
and previous work in the soils lab

83
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,979
indicated to us that there were grain

84
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,200
morphology traits on the group five

85
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:43,679
chromosomes but our challenge now is to

86
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:46,709
zoom in on those and identify the

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,859
positional gene architecture and

88
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,539
physical positions of causal variants to

89
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:54,659
do this we have a two pronged approach

90
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:57,409
we can first validate the QTL across

91
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:00,750
environments and locations and gears

92
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:03,750
using the double complex and then we can

93
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,878
gain finer resolution and pursue fine

94
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,549
mapping by using heterogeneous inbred

95
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:12,030
families these are essentially near

96
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,340
isogenic lions differ at the QTL we

97
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,259
develop them from selecting recombinant

98
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,108
inbred lines that were segregating for

99
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,939
the QTL or regions of interest and then

100
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,029
have continuously inbred them so they're

101
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:27,449
largely fixed across the genome but have

102
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:29,129
either perennials allele at the QTL as a

103
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,689
control for our purposes or they're

104
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:33,060
segregating which will allow us to

105
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:34,769
identify key recombination events that

106
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,189
are associated with our positive trait

107
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:40,139
of interest all of these plants are

108
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:41,610
filled grown we've been working with the

109
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,939
double-top Lloyd's and the hits in the

110
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,340
field since 2016 and they're planted

111
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:50,610
rows for the double top Lloyds but we

112
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:53,189
have to plant the individual spaced

113
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,870
planted rows because they're segregating

114
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:57,449
again and we tagged them individually as

115
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,590
you can see here so we can keep track of

116
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:02,490
them for all of our phenotype and

117
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:05,279
genotyping purposes the genotyping this

118
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,199
is a largely are the synthetic a pot of

119
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,789
population is widely used in the wheat

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,819
breeding community so we've access to a

121
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,810
lot of public resources for genotyping I

122
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,029
specifically have been doping cast

123
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,470
markers which are a fluorescent step

124
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:23,089
marker for targeting more specific

125
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:26,580
regions associated with our QTL the

126
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:30,750
genotyping which is cut off here is all

127
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:32,729
done post harvest and we harvest all the

128
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,529
plants individually and take a

129
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,290
representative hundred kernel sample

130
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:39,119
which is a proxy for thousand kernel

131
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,620
weight and then we also take that same

132
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,170
sample and scan it on a flatbed scanner

133
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,240
and take the kernel width and length

134
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,770
parameters which is what you can't see

135
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,329
written right there

136
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:52,859
and then all of our phenotype engine

137
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:56,969
type correlations I've been using are

138
00:05:52,860 --> 00:06:00,840
QTL at this point we've identified TTL

139
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,280
on chromosomes 2 D 5 a 5 B and 60 that

140
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,279
are significantly associated with

141
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,379
thousand kernel weight and or the width

142
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:11,750
and the length but I want to draw your

143
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:14,370
attention to chromosome 5 um there is a

144
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,290
mega base pair stretch on the long arm

145
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,560
that is significantly associated with

146
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:21,900
thousand kernel weight and kernel width

147
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,550
this region is more highly annotated

148
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:25,439
than what I'm showing you here but for

149
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,960
today's purposes I just want to mention

150
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,870
that it is fully fixed across the double

151
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:34,459
top woods we either have a pot or the

152
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,870
synthetic alleles for all of these

153
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:38,339
markers but within the hips

154
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,569
it's segregating and that's going to

155
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,949
allow us to pursue the further find

156
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:43,439
mapping

157
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:45,509
our QTL then provides us with a lot

158
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,610
score or logarithm odds which is a

159
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,469
measurement of significance between a

160
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,980
genetic marker and a physical trait that

161
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,570
we've measured here in dark blue we have

162
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:58,800
across this 140 mega base pair region

163
00:06:54,569 --> 00:07:00,180
the LOD score significant values 4000

164
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,949
kernel weight and in light blue that's

165
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,620
going to be for the width measurements

166
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:07,349
and consistently we break our threshold

167
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,439
significance level of 3 now I want to

168
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:12,390
show you the parental associations for

169
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,100
these alleles and which parents allele

170
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,229
is the positive donor for these traits

171
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,120
we can do that by breaking the double

172
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,530
tabloid population into two groups based

173
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,319
on whether they carry the synthetic

174
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:24,509
allele or the APOD allele across 140

175
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,250
mega base pair region and looking

176
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:28,439
specifically here at the thousand kernel

177
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,180
8 distribution thousand kernel a is on

178
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,639
the x-axis and we've broken the

179
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,540
population into two groups with a pata

180
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,449
alleles across the locus and pink or

181
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,819
synthetic and blue and on average we see

182
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,039
a 4.4 percent increase in thousand

183
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:47,639
kurtal wait for double tabloid lines

184
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,490
that carry the pata allele rather than

185
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,439
the synthetic and we see a similar story

186
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,769
when we look at the width distributions

187
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,439
here width is on the x-axis and again

188
00:07:55,769 --> 00:08:00,689
there's 3.75 percent increase in kernel

189
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,939
widths associated with double tabloid

190
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,660
lines that carry the PATA allele rather

191
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:10,379
than the synthetic at our locus I

192
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:12,300
mentioned previously that kernel lengths

193
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:16,439
can also independently impact kernel

194
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,360
weight and so here you see at our locus

195
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,759
there's little to no difference in

196
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,259
kernel length for whether a double

197
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,240
haploid plant carries either parents

198
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,430
allele which indicates to us we're

199
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,100
pursuing a gene in this region that

200
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:32,430
controls thousand kernel e most likely

201
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,800
due to an increase in kernel width our

202
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:37,799
ultimate goal is to be introducing these

203
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,439
genes into varieties that farmers like

204
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,870
to grow we're doing this simultaneously

205
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,970
by back crossing the genes as we

206
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,980
continue to find map them into elite

207
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,930
varieties ground by domestic farmers as

208
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,730
well as through the caps collaboration

209
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:55,120
with cement and we'll continue to pursue

210
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:58,080
the identification

211
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,399
candidate genes and then further

212
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,440
identify and validate the gene

213
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,240
architecture through mutant populations

214
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,940
and then potentially gene editing if

215
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,470
that suits our purposes a challenge that

216
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,140
I mentioned is that the double tabloid

217
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,120
population has limited resolution but if

218
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:16,929
we return to our methodologies and

219
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,028
strategies I can develop cast primers

220
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:21,489
that target recombination events at our

221
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:24,519
QTL taking place in the segregating half

222
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,930
population over 200 hit plants are

223
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,179
harvested from the field this summer and

224
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:29,919
they've been genotyped and I mean the

225
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:31,838
process of phenotyping those and those

226
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,729
correlations will lay a strong

227
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,300
foundation for the continuous fine

228
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:40,330
mapping of these traits and our field

229
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:41,769
plantings this summer with that I'd like

230
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,600
to say thank you to the many advisers

231
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:46,379
that I have on this research and would

232
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,379
be happy to answer any questions

233
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:54,300
[Applause]

234
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,299
question

235
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:05,079
for the distributions of kernel width it

236
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:06,669
appeared like this bimodal yeah thing

237
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,379
going on do you have an explanation for

238
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:10,240
that is there another gene segregating

239
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:13,360
for some reason there are there may be

240
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,700
um I've noticed as well when we work

241
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,709
with this population in the field it's

242
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,440
really diverse there's a lot of

243
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:21,909
different phenotypes and I'm sure there

244
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,980
is something that we aren't catching I

245
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:25,360
also mentioned just how complex field is

246
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,740
and there's many different traits

247
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,570
affecting it as we grow fewer plants

248
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,769
that were more confident in the region

249
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,330
of the gene I hope that we can take

250
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:37,750
further phenotypes that might account

251
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:42,759
for some of those effects but I'm not

252
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:44,669
sure what trait is causing that any

253
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:53,139
other questions

254
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:55,208
all right let's give another room this
