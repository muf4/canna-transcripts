1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,850
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:04,849
University

3
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:10,539
yeah okay great so my name is Cedric

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:13,419
Mason I work with the New York State

5
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:16,208
soil health initiative also with David

6
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:17,500
Wolfe who's a PI on the project and

7
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:20,589
we're working with policymakers

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,689
researchers nonprofits all types of

9
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:26,109
stakeholders in the state who are

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,879
interested in soil health to try to

11
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:30,880
improve soil health all across the state

12
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:33,189
of New York which is a little bit

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:37,659
complex because New York has so many

14
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:40,599
different types of crops so soil health

15
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:43,479
is important because it supports food

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,329
production for us most of the food that

17
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:48,099
we eat comes from soil it plays a large

18
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:50,439
role in protecting our water resources

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,579
and it also has the potential to help us

20
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:56,829
mitigate climate change so some of the

21
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:58,239
benefits of healthy soil especially with

22
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:02,799
regard to food production which we're

23
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:05,140
going to focus on today healthy soil has

24
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:09,280
high levels of organic matter which help

25
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:14,200
retain retain soil moisture retain water

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,019
in the in the soil for crops to use it

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,659
also supplies nutrients for those crops

28
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:22,679
it feeds an intact soil microbiome which

29
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:27,790
can include things like earthworms

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,979
insects bacteria and other microbes and

31
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,990
it can healthy soil can also also

32
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:34,030
function to protect against crop

33
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:38,560
diseases that could negatively impact

34
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:41,140
these food crops and finally a healthy

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,109
soil provides a wide range of pore sizes

36
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,790
which are conducive to both water

37
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:51,069
holding capacity and also routing and

38
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:54,100
drainage but in New York a lot of or a

39
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:56,019
few things can go wrong with with with

40
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:57,459
maintaining our soils so when we're

41
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:00,340
driving these heavy tractors over these

42
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:02,769
soils it's compressing the soil making

43
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,409
it hard and difficult for water and

44
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:06,908
roots to move through that soil then

45
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:10,000
what happens is we end up with some

46
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:12,030
erosion that can carry nutrients the

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,889
sediment off the field into waterways

48
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,819
which has other negative impacts off the

49
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:21,619
farm

50
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:24,340
and tilling can also result in loss of

51
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,310
organic matter through oxidation and

52
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,789
make it difficult for some of these for

53
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,140
the soil microbiome especially

54
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:35,959
earthworms are impacted by tillage and

55
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:37,639
some of these fungal networks that can

56
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,629
transport nutrients to plants are also

57
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:43,759
affected so why do we tell to begin with

58
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:48,879
a big part of it is to break up

59
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:53,259
compaction and that initial tillage

60
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:57,650
creates conditions that that sometimes

61
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:59,209
perpetuate the problem so compaction if

62
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,189
we treat that compaction with tillage

63
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:04,370
we're burning off some of that organic

64
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:07,270
matter oxidizing it quickly we're

65
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,409
feeding unhealthy microbial communities

66
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,300
we're breaking apart those soil

67
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:13,009
aggregates that provide the soil

68
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,760
structure and provide the drainage that

69
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:19,669
we need and then that soil gets

70
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:21,379
recommand we need to plow again so we're

71
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:24,019
trying to break this cycle and find

72
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:26,719
other ways to produce the crops that we

73
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:29,530
need to eat and also maintain these

74
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,669
other benefits that soils are giving us

75
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,099
so specifically we're looking at these

76
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:37,129
three three practices reduced tillage

77
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:40,609
cover crops and organic amendments which

78
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:42,319
include compost manure and biochar so

79
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:47,209
reduced tillage has the benefits of

80
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:49,219
preserving these these the microbiome in

81
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:51,830
the soil preserves the macro pores we're

82
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:54,109
not disturbing the soil as much and

83
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,020
we're also retaining out organic matter

84
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:59,570
which stores carbon provides nutrients

85
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,810
to the plants and also the microbes in

86
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:04,430
the soil and in addition off the farm

87
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,259
when we start to look at the impacts of

88
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,879
reduced tillage we're saving on fuel

89
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:10,250
because we're not driving our tractors

90
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,319
as much we're saving on time and labor

91
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,479
and we're saving wear and tear on our

92
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,060
equipment so there's other benefits as

93
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,879
well when we look at cover crops we're

94
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:23,959
looking at the on the rooting action of

95
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:27,620
these plants can both break up hardpan

96
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,930
break up compaction that allows the soil

97
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,899
to absorb more water to transmit it to

98
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,150
the water table we're adding organic

99
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:37,758
matter from the from the plant material

100
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:39,168
that's returned to the soil if we're

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,240
growing a leg ooh like in the bottom

102
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:46,069
left corner this is a pee cover crop mix

103
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,350
legumes can provide nitrogen in the

104
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:52,219
soils by absorbing it from the air and

105
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,600
through nitrogen nitrogen fixation and

106
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,850
there's really a wide variety of

107
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,789
applications and types of cover crops

108
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:02,090
and depending on what crop we grow we

109
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:05,569
can be providing forage on farm animals

110
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:10,038
and also producing Co products like for

111
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:12,469
example sunflower seeds but in this

112
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:15,649
climate we have this long winter gets

113
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,130
pretty cold and there's some challenges

114
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,969
to getting these crops established and

115
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:24,019
getting the benefits that they can

116
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,280
provide especially over the winter only

117
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:27,288
about 10 percent of New York State

118
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,909
cropland is currently cover cropped or

119
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:32,300
at least it wasn't 2012 maybe that

120
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,919
numbers up a little bit and there's a

121
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,189
challenge to get these cover crops

122
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,659
established and fit them in with the

123
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:40,069
rotations of the other crops that we're

124
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,010
trying to grow because corn and soy

125
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:45,408
usually come off they're harvested in in

126
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:48,288
the fall and that at that point the

127
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:49,719
growing season is winding down and it's

128
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:53,389
really difficult to get plants

129
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,360
established at that point so there's

130
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:57,949
some research looking at interceding

131
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,330
which is involves planting these cover

132
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,509
crops between the rows of corn or

133
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:04,009
soybeans to get them established earlier

134
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:07,180
and finally we're looking at these

135
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:11,719
organic matter amendments where we're

136
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:14,509
taking oftentimes waste waste products

137
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,770
crop waste or food waste creating a

138
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:20,569
valuable compost or biochar from them or

139
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:22,009
in the case of dairy farms manure and

140
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:23,810
these can be applied to the soils and

141
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:26,779
and adding organic matter back into the

142
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:30,079
soil and this provides nutrients for the

143
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:32,478
crops as well as the the microbes which

144
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,448
in turn help help preserve the soil

145
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,939
structure and these also have the

146
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:42,930
benefits of reducing co2 and methane

147
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:46,620
that might come from improper

148
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,509
position of these materials so what I'm

149
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,360
going to talk about today is looking at

150
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:54,000
some of the benefits costs and

151
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,729
constraints that farmers see when

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,819
they're trying to when they're trying to

153
00:06:56,728 --> 00:07:02,639
implement these practices because a lot

154
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:04,889
of them are coming from a place where

155
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,850
they haven't been using cover crops they

156
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:13,410
haven't been reusing reduced tillage and

157
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:17,610
it's a big challenge for them to to sort

158
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:20,250
of change the direction of the ship so

159
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,660
to speak a lot of times they're running

160
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,550
a business a lot of farms in this

161
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,349
country or our businesses so they're

162
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,288
trying to make money and trying to pay

163
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:31,009
their bills just like the rest of us so

164
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:34,019
we really looked closely with this study

165
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:36,870
excuse me it looked closely in the study

166
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:40,348
about at the financial picture these

167
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,090
farmers are seeing so one of the tools

168
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:45,538
that farmers can use when they're trying

169
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:47,638
to plan ahead and and evaluate potential

170
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:50,339
changes and they're in their practices

171
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,740
is that they can use this this framework

172
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:57,198
called the partial budget analysis and

173
00:07:52,740 --> 00:08:01,019
the partial budget analysis looks at the

174
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,220
expected change in their business that

175
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:05,459
would come about when they use these

176
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,139
practices so it could involve extra

177
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,180
expenses that they weren't seeing before

178
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,030
it could involve extra benefits that

179
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,280
they weren't saying seeing before and so

180
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:19,339
here I've outlined these a bit for you

181
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:23,129
and we can see the green the green

182
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:27,739
examples here are examples that would

183
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:30,810
positively impact business for example

184
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,219
less fertilizer less pesticides that's

185
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:39,000
less money you need to spend on those

186
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:42,870
inputs also we might be seeing greater

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,940
yields and that can increase income so

188
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,620
again it's kind of we're looking at both

189
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,990
the positive and the negative aspects of

190
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,230
these changes and then over here we see

191
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,930
the negative aspects which might include

192
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,420
extra cost for cover crop seed or

193
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:58,979
special planting equipment

194
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:01,559
and you might have to take some land out

195
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,289
of out of rotation to plant those cover

196
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:06,599
crops and grow them for a year or so to

197
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:09,679
get your soil health going so we're

198
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,680
looking at all these different factors

199
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,020
and so there's there have been some

200
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,910
studies that have used this partial

201
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,549
budget analysis and looked at some

202
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:22,620
specific farms this is an example of a

203
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:25,679
case study that was done by a company

204
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,509
called dot to research on a farm this is

205
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,479
a corn and soybean farm in the Midwest

206
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:32,088
and so here you can see they did a

207
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,120
five-year study one two three four five

208
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:40,140
and you can see that there's an initial

209
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,970
cost in this case kind of an investment

210
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,649
if you will and then after a couple

211
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:47,879
years that investment starts to pay off

212
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:51,419
and you can track the net benefit here

213
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:54,088
and and see that a little bit down the

214
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:56,099
line there could be some real benefits

215
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:58,140
to this which is great because these

216
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,850
practices also provide these

217
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,850
environmental benefits these climate

218
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,920
mitigation benefits so if we can make

219
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,519
these if these practices can be

220
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:09,149
profitable to the farmer it can be good

221
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,838
for everybody

222
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:16,470
right it's a win-win situation so what

223
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:18,899
we do is we we want to capture more than

224
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,079
one farm in this state we want to

225
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:24,629
capture the whole state we wanted to

226
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:26,759
identify with this survey identify the

227
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:28,259
specific cost that farmers were seeing

228
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:32,338
and the specific benefits that they were

229
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:34,819
seeing we wanted to encompass all of the

230
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:36,899
all the types of farms in the state

231
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,020
including different levels of experience

232
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:42,450
different crop crop types different

233
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:44,970
systems organic conventional different

234
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:47,459
farm sizes we saw we actually saw farms

235
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:51,089
from I think the smallest was like point

236
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:54,479
1 acres up to like 5,000 acres so this

237
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:57,180
is really a broad broad survey that I'm

238
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,200
going to present here and finally we

239
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:03,629
also want to see how these how improve

240
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:09,490
soil health might help these farms help

241
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:12,999
farmers weather the storm if you will by

242
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,379
being able to sustain crop production in

243
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:18,540
adverse years where there might be

244
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:23,110
flooding or there might be odd droughts

245
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:25,928
so what we do is we conducted the survey

246
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,058
we distributed paper copies of the

247
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:30,399
survey which actually I have some

248
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:34,568
leftovers here if anybody's curious to

249
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:37,600
just check it out feel free to just stop

250
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:40,088
by and I'll give you one and we also

251
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,389
used an online platform called Qualtrics

252
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:45,309
where respondents could access the

253
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:48,149
survey online and just take it from the

254
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:51,578
comfort of their own home which was

255
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:53,198
actually a really great great way to go

256
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:56,289
a lot of a lot of responses came in that

257
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:59,078
way so we looked at these three

258
00:11:56,289 --> 00:12:03,789
practices reduced tillage cover crops

259
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:05,498
and soil amendments and we asked farmers

260
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:08,588
questions about their practices and the

261
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:10,689
benefits that they were seeing and

262
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,119
statistically we used the type the

263
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:16,118
chi-square test to evaluate some of

264
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:21,069
those associations between say a

265
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:24,189
cropping practice and the benefits so we

266
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:25,948
received 182 respondents from all over

267
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:28,899
the state this is just a map showing

268
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:30,578
sort of the geographic distribution of

269
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:34,688
the responses that we received we got

270
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:39,039
really a good response rate in a lot of

271
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:44,308
the heavy agricultural areas here on in

272
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,998
western New York so the response rate

273
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:48,990
correlates pretty well with the

274
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:52,298
agricultural districts across the state

275
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:55,629
46 counties accounted for over one

276
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:57,009
hundred seventy two thousand acres so

277
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:59,829
the first question on the survey was

278
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:01,959
really what constraints do you see to

279
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:05,528
crop production on your farm and this is

280
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:07,958
how farmers answered so the most the

281
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:10,028
most frequent answer actually they could

282
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:13,688
check off multiple answers but the most

283
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:15,850
common answer was for drainage second

284
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:18,009
was compaction and third was erosion and

285
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,230
this is interesting because these are

286
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:22,418
all three constraints that could be that

287
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,930
can be addressed with soil health

288
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:35,129
practices

289
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:38,279
and then you can see others here so we

290
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:40,159
were interested in determining farmers

291
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,029
who use these reduced tillage practices

292
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,439
what are they spending their money on

293
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,350
what are the what are the investments

294
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:50,640
required and also what are the benefits

295
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:52,139
that they're seeing so this is the

296
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,120
results of the reduced tillage pool

297
00:13:52,139 --> 00:14:00,139
there were a hundred and forty nine

298
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,210
149 responses and of course this adds up

299
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,919
to more than 149 because a lot of the

300
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,680
farms were growing multiple crops with

301
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,929
reduced tillage but we can see that the

302
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,509
most the most popular crop here is corn

303
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:15,039
and soy for feed followed by grains oil

304
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:17,838
seeds dry beans the gray bar

305
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,870
alfalfa pasture hay basically forage is

306
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:24,589
a big one and vegetables the very common

307
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:27,440
in the reduced tillage group so the

308
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:30,050
number one cost that we're seeing these

309
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,420
farmers spend that these farmers are

310
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:34,039
seeing a specialized tillage equipment

311
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:35,990
about half of them reported spending

312
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,679
money on that or at least encountering

313
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:42,830
that obstacle and then along with that

314
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:45,229
specialized planning equipment a lot of

315
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,550
times if you're doing reduced tillage

316
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,740
you might be trying to plant through a

317
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:50,629
sod residue so you need a special grain

318
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,720
planter that will help you plant your

319
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:56,330
crops through that and then if you're

320
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,580
reducing tillage you're reducing them

321
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,370
you're eliminating that mechanism of of

322
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:04,009
weed control and so you might be

323
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,980
spending great more money on herbicides

324
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:09,230
and then of course their additional

325
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,560
compounds down here increased labor

326
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:15,909
lower yields but these are the three big

327
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:18,889
ones and so what we did is we compared

328
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:21,620
some a couple of different rock types so

329
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:24,740
the yellow bar here represents farmers

330
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:28,220
who only grow corn and soybeans with

331
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:30,139
reduced tillage and the green bar is is

332
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,259
farmers who only grow vegetables with

333
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:34,429
reduced tillage and then the gray here

334
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:36,769
is the yellow so we're looking at

335
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:40,338
specialized planting equipment and we're

336
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:43,519
seeing that overall around 50% of people

337
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:45,589
our farmers are using this are requiring

338
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,299
planting equipment but the vegetable

339
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:49,339
growers really are not reporting that as

340
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:52,009
a cost I think that really reflects

341
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:54,020
their their cropping system maybe a lot

342
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:56,629
of them are organic and they're planting

343
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:58,850
doing transplants by hand or they can

344
00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:01,039
use their existing transplanter so

345
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:04,310
they're not really seeing that as a as a

346
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,769
big obstacle for them another

347
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:09,378
interesting one was you can see that

348
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:11,720
overall here

349
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:15,048
increased labor was pretty low really

350
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,660
only maybe 13% of the farmers said okay

351
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:22,278
to do reduce tillage I need to put in

352
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:24,828
more labor and very clearly corn and soy

353
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,568
growers are not putting in more labor to

354
00:16:24,828 --> 00:16:30,019
reduce their tillage in fact it's the

355
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:31,668
opposite for them but vegetable growers

356
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:33,859
are reporting this expense at a much

357
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:35,838
higher rate so almost 40% of vegetable

358
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:37,038
growers doing reduced reduced tillage

359
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,829
you're saying yeah I got to work a

360
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:42,979
little bit harder maybe I'm cultivating

361
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:45,698
more often or I'm hand weeding I'm

362
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:47,509
moving tarps around something like that

363
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:49,969
and this is a this is a pretty

364
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:52,489
significant p-value from our chi-square

365
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,139
test you can see that's a big difference

366
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:56,059
so we're pretty sure there's a

367
00:16:54,139 --> 00:17:00,349
difference there between the vegetables

368
00:16:56,058 --> 00:17:02,328
and the corn soy growers looking at the

369
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:04,009
switching to the benefits that these

370
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:06,619
farmers are seeing from their reduced

371
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:09,318
tillage practices less erosion and

372
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:13,878
sedimentation repair is a big one in

373
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:16,490
some cases if erosion is happening the

374
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:20,088
soils basically moving from from the

375
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:22,909
field into their drainage areas and a

376
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:24,528
lot of farmers have to run their tractor

377
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:27,319
and kind of move that soil back they

378
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:29,269
might have to fix some some rails and

379
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:34,158
gullies so that they can drive their

380
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:38,149
equipment across the field so this is a

381
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:41,769
big benefit for them 83% said that this

382
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:41,768
was a benefit and then

383
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:47,309
contrast to the increased labor that we

384
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:48,960
saw among the vegetable growers 74% are

385
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:50,729
saying yeah and send I'm spending less

386
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,129
on labor fuel and equipment I'm not

387
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:56,129
driving my tractor as much not not

388
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:57,898
driving that tractor myself as much and

389
00:17:56,128 --> 00:18:02,128
then interestingly over half said I'm

390
00:17:57,898 --> 00:18:05,158
also getting greater yields so the

391
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:08,699
benefits are real and then there's also

392
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:10,919
a lot of other ones of what is drainage

393
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,019
of best avoided drainage investments

394
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,820
less irrigation maybe they're building

395
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:16,589
their organic matter so their soils

396
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:18,778
holding onto water better they don't

397
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:23,878
have to irrigate as much it could be a

398
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:25,848
savings and then looking again at the

399
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:29,608
the differences between these crop types

400
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:33,269
we're looking at greater yields that was

401
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:36,149
around about 52% overall

402
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:37,769
let's see here but maybe not quite as

403
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,040
prevalent among the corn and soy growers

404
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:43,680
as it is to the vegetable growers I'm

405
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,289
not quite sure why that is

406
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,900
this isn't actually statistically highly

407
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:56,039
statistically significant so it could be

408
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:59,519
an artifact looking at lower fertilizer

409
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:01,470
input corn and soy growers they're you

410
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,259
know they're saying no I still got to

411
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,789
put the same amount of fertilizer on but

412
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:09,059
vegetable growers are seeing a benefit

413
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:13,409
here and this is fairly significant here

414
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:15,059
the 0.05 p-value and then finally to

415
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,910
wrap up this section on reduced tillage

416
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:20,159
we asked about the profitability and I

417
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,769
think the main picture here is that very

418
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,100
few farmers are saying this is

419
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:29,339
decreasing my profitability so

420
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:30,569
overwhelmingly the majority are finding

421
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:38,639
this practice beneficial to their

422
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:40,559
business which is good so now we're

423
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,000
going to switch a little bit and look at

424
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:47,179
cover crops so just to kind of recap

425
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,210
again the cover crops are planted

426
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:52,769
between crops to protect the soil

427
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:57,329
provide feed organic matter back into

428
00:19:52,769 --> 00:20:00,150
the soil and this was the breakdown of

429
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:03,379
our the pool that we saw responding to

430
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:07,460
our cover crop practices there were 125

431
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:11,630
farms that we saw doing cover crops

432
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:14,039
number one again is this corn soy and

433
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:18,180
then followed by vegetables surprisingly

434
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:20,159
so vegetables are out there and then

435
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,740
grains and oil seeds dry beans is the

436
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,630
gray bar here number three and again

437
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,400
yellow Falcon pasture hey

438
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,060
followed by some of these other minor

439
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,060
crops here

440
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:35,358
so prevalent costs and decreases in

441
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:39,319
revenue from cover crops the big one

442
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:40,970
here is cover crop seed so I think this

443
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,378
indicates the very few farmers are

444
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,419
actually growing their own own cover

445
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:46,598
crop seed which isn't really surprising

446
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:50,359
I think that would be a kind of a

447
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:53,868
complicated operation but maybe some of

448
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:55,848
them are doing it cover crop

449
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:58,278
determination is a big concern among

450
00:20:55,848 --> 00:21:00,589
people growing these cover crops because

451
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:03,288
if that cover crop goes to seed and you

452
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:04,638
can't you can't kill it and that seed is

453
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:08,118
in your soil and it could interfere with

454
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:10,569
your cash crop so cover crop termination

455
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:13,368
costs not surprising that's up there

456
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:15,378
there's different ways of terminating a

457
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:18,138
cover crop you could let it winter kill

458
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:21,589
which is just to let the cold kill the

459
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:23,269
crop some crops like radishes winter

460
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:26,019
kill by themselves so you don't have to

461
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:26,019
worry about that too much

462
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,069
you could mow it which might kill some

463
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:33,348
cover crops you could spray it spray it

464
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:35,720
and burn it down with herbicide and you

465
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:37,999
can also roll it if you're usually if

466
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:43,579
you're doing an organic of an organic

467
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:46,579
system which has its own challenges so

468
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:50,019
these are sort of the items that would

469
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:52,398
negative affect negatively affect a

470
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:54,919
business that's doing these cover crops

471
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:58,608
and it's also interesting to look at

472
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:01,788
some of these additional ones too people

473
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:04,178
might be putting in more labor to get

474
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:06,888
these cover crops in or spending time

475
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:08,330
learning about how to how to do it cover

476
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:11,148
crops is a pretty tricky thing at the

477
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:15,829
timing is really important the type of

478
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:17,358
cover crop is really important so

479
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:22,398
there's there's definitely some other

480
00:22:17,358 --> 00:22:24,408
considerations in there too and we

481
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:25,819
didn't actually see any coming back to

482
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,559
this one we didn't actually see many

483
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:32,378
differences between the crop types in

484
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:32,378
the costs these cover crop supplies so

485
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:38,650
so we can switch threats right to the

486
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:41,980
benefits of cover crops so looking at

487
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:45,790
these benefits less erosion is a big one

488
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,710
83.9% are claiming less erosion from the

489
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:49,899
recovered crops which if you remember

490
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,700
that was one of the top three

491
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,920
constraints that farmers were also

492
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,840
reporting so this is cover crops are

493
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,100
really a great tool to combat this

494
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:02,919
erosion cover crops can actually reduce

495
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:05,429
her actually result in greater yields

496
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:09,400
maybe they're providing better drainage

497
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:11,640
and therefore your crop is growing

498
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,170
better it's getting a little bit more

499
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,660
nutrient cycling going down it going on

500
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:21,220
in the soil could be returning the

501
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:23,290
organic matter and also lower fertilizer

502
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,650
inputs can result from these cover crops

503
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:27,970
maybe that's from simply the organic

504
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,259
matter that's being built up and

505
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,690
returned to the soil or it could be

506
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:33,490
because they're growing a legume cover

507
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:36,400
crop that's fixing that nitrogen in the

508
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:39,539
soil and this one really has a whole lot

509
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,890
of whole lot of other minor

510
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:45,009
considerations here easier faster

511
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,420
harvest could be a big one if you can

512
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:48,990
get your equipment in there at the right

513
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:52,180
time because your soil has drained

514
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:58,870
adequately that that could that could

515
00:23:52,180 --> 00:24:00,009
make your life a lot easier and but we

516
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:02,759
did that we did see some more

517
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:06,460
differences between these crop types

518
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:09,430
these benefits of cover crops looking at

519
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,529
the greater cash crop yields we see

520
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:15,160
overall right around 50% of reporting

521
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:16,839
that but not as many corn and soy and a

522
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,580
whole lot of vegetable growers are

523
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:23,169
saying greater yields of cash crops

524
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:26,259
decrease fertilizer inputs similar

525
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:30,480
picture again the vegetable growers

526
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:30,480
really responding to that item

527
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,969
and I think this could be due to maybe

528
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,920
the types of cover crops that vegetables

529
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:45,190
are likely to grow I think corn and soy

530
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:48,070
growers they're probably either taking

531
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,840
land out of rotation for a year to grow

532
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:54,669
something or they're trying to they're

533
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:57,309
doing a grass like triticale or rye in

534
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,920
the fall to get that overwinter cover

535
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:02,079
and that's not really providing their

536
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,150
their nitrogen requirements in addition

537
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:07,839
there's this all also this consideration

538
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:10,480
of adding this high carbon mix back into

539
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:15,129
your soil which can soak up your other

540
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,539
nitrogen so it's it makes it makes sense

541
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:22,690
that these corn and soy growers are not

542
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:25,779
reporting that as as frequently however

543
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,430
they are seeing this benefit using the

544
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:31,960
cover crops as a source of animal forage

545
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:36,850
so corn and soy is a big dairy feed crop

546
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:39,549
right so these farmers have cows on the

547
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:41,859
farm they're feeding them every day they

548
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:44,079
figure hey we can throw a cover crop

549
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:48,159
that protects the soil and also feeds

550
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:51,069
the cows like that's a double-edged

551
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:54,790
sword so to speak vegetable growers are

552
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:56,200
not really seeing that as much maybe

553
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:58,629
because they don't have the animals

554
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,259
incorporated into the system that's

555
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:04,890
frequently and we ask the same question

556
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:12,400
about these the profitability overall

557
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:15,700
and got a similar response again very

558
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,700
few are saying this is a not not a

559
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:22,150
profitable practice um well a lot are

560
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:24,819
saying yeah it's profitable or has a

561
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:27,160
neutral impact so again this comes down

562
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:29,980
to the balance of those positive and

563
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,660
negative aspects that I talked about

564
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:35,890
with the partial budget analysis and

565
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:39,090
kind of everything boiling down to is

566
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,090
this investment paying off

567
00:26:42,028 --> 00:26:46,619
and so the second big question that we

568
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:50,209
asked with this survey is how long does

569
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:52,439
it take to see some of these benefits so

570
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:58,528
soils generally change pretty slowly

571
00:26:52,440 --> 00:27:03,269
we've all heard the you know the numbers

572
00:26:58,528 --> 00:27:04,919
about how quickly soil can be eroded but

573
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:06,929
how long it takes for us to build

574
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,850
topsoil to build that organic matter

575
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:13,200
back so we're really interested in

576
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:16,500
finding out how long it takes for those

577
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,440
farmers to see that extra income that

578
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:22,558
that increased yield that reduced

579
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,210
irrigation requirements and what we did

580
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,210
is we broke down all the respondents in

581
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,700
each of these pools into experience

582
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,649
levels from one to five years five to

583
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,740
ten years ten to twenty years and more

584
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:36,538
than twenty years and we got a good a

585
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:40,319
good representation across all of those

586
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:42,509
time periods and we used that to to

587
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,990
evaluate the point in time at which

588
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:47,250
these farmers are seeing these benefits

589
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:50,849
so this is probably the strongest

590
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:52,919
relationship that we saw which

591
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:55,730
interestingly is not necessarily related

592
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,899
to soil health but it is related to

593
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,659
income and benefits that these farmers

594
00:27:57,898 --> 00:28:02,959
might be seeing there's several

595
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:06,299
different cost share options out there

596
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,470
that farmers can tap into to help cover

597
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:11,490
the cost of doing these practices

598
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:13,589
because there's policies conservation

599
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,388
policies that are trying to provide wild

600
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:19,138
wildlife habitat and protect these water

601
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:21,209
resources so they're helping farmers do

602
00:28:19,138 --> 00:28:23,879
these practices and interestingly what

603
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,679
we saw is that the highest percentage of

604
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,820
farmers accessing these programs are in

605
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,788
the most experienced group whereas it's

606
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:35,250
the opposite with the one to five year

607
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:38,129
group which is kind of unfortunate

608
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:40,130
because what we really want is is to be

609
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:43,169
helping these farmers get going and

610
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:46,350
helping them get these practices in

611
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:49,889
place and that's really why these why

612
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:51,379
these policies exist is to to get things

613
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:55,129
off the ground a little bit so

614
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:56,740
um I think maybe this reflects the

615
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,580
difficulty that some farmers have

616
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,079
navigating these policies and

617
00:28:58,579 --> 00:29:03,799
understanding them and understanding how

618
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:08,319
to tap into them and hopefully this will

619
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:10,579
be be useful for policy makers and

620
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:13,399
realizing that they need to do a better

621
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:15,169
job of making these early adopters aware

622
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,700
of these programs and getting them

623
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:21,440
involved we saw a similar pattern with

624
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,360
respect to less erosion and

625
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,519
sedimentation repair so this is again

626
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,649
reduced tillage and so we're not

627
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,960
disturbing the soil as much not breaking

628
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:36,140
up the slope or is not oxidizing that

629
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:38,690
organic matter and therefore we're

630
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,340
creating better infiltration better

631
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,890
Waterland from the infiltration and

632
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:46,399
seeing less erosion and we're seeing

633
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:48,050
that that grows over time almost 200

634
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,570
percent in music these two more

635
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:53,809
experienced groups but we're also seeing

636
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:55,039
that there is frequently an immediate

637
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:57,049
effect

638
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:03,430
even within the one to five year group

639
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:05,659
here so oh I'd say that's over 60% of

640
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:09,500
reduced tillage practitioners are seeing

641
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:16,100
an immediate effect on their on their

642
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:19,000
erosion issues and this is using the

643
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:24,740
chi-square test we we saw that this was

644
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,240
significant association and then looking

645
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,579
at the delay period for benefits of

646
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,900
cover crops so again this is a little

647
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:32,149
bit of a different mechanism these cover

648
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:36,740
crops are covering the soil holding it

649
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:38,330
in place and interestingly we did not

650
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:42,680
really see a strong pattern here you can

651
00:30:38,329 --> 00:30:44,389
see the p-value is 0.6 so it doesn't

652
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:49,220
really look like there's an association

653
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:51,980
but initially more than 75% are saying

654
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:55,250
yeah growing cover crops is reducing my

655
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:58,549
erosion and that's consistent for the

656
00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:01,579
next 20 plus years so cover crops this

657
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:04,809
showing cover crops are are immediately

658
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:04,809
effective in reducing erosion

659
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:12,750
this is a another graph looking at these

660
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:17,519
these different experience levels here

661
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:19,230
and we're seeing greater yields among

662
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,319
these farmers who have been using cover

663
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:24,630
crops longer and this could reflect the

664
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:28,589
length of time that it takes those cover

665
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:33,900
crops to to impact the soil health in

666
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:36,619
tangible ways but also we're seeing you

667
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:41,340
know a bit a bit of a bit of that even

668
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:44,879
among the early adopters here and this

669
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:48,299
is a pretty decent p-value so we think

670
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,630
there's an association there and this is

671
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:53,940
the converse of that last slide so this

672
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,020
was greater yields of cash crops being

673
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,910
more prevalent among the more

674
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:58,980
experienced groups here we're seeing

675
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:01,920
lower yields of cash crops more

676
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:05,039
prevalent among the early adopters but

677
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:07,050
then it quickly drops off so really none

678
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,940
of these none of these more experienced

679
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:11,669
practitioners we're reporting reduce

680
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,799
yields because only in the the early

681
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:16,980
adopter group here so I think those two

682
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:21,809
slides together really complete that

683
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:25,019
picture of the initial investment maybe

684
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:27,569
there's an initial cost but quickly your

685
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:30,990
yields should bounce back and an

686
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:33,029
increase so finally the third question

687
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,549
that we looked at was the resilience of

688
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:38,099
these the resilience that farmers were

689
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:40,529
seeing to some extreme weather events so

690
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:42,299
we asked them about the ability of their

691
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:44,849
cover crop practices the reduced tillage

692
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:47,970
and their soil amendment practices to

693
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:51,899
mitigate a really heavy downfall or

694
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:56,460
really heavy rainfall flooding and

695
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,840
drought and so here just as an example

696
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,420
of what can happen

697
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,889
heavy rainfall maybe you'll get a couple

698
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:04,170
inches within an hour and that can

699
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:07,280
really I'll pretty much submerge your

700
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:10,650
crop if your soil is not absorbing that

701
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:14,029
precipitation and on the other end of

702
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:17,670
the spectrum we see here a farmer in

703
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:19,440
September looking at his his corn

704
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:24,450
field that hasn't gotten rain in several

705
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:32,009
months and is severely impacted by that

706
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:34,519
by a drought so so both of these

707
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:39,390
situations could potentially be

708
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:42,420
mitigated with healthy soil and so the

709
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:46,620
responses that we got we're interesting

710
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:48,600
in that a majority over 60% of farmers

711
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:51,599
who are using either cover crops to

712
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:53,699
reduce tillage are saying across the

713
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:58,740
board yeah it's helping prevent flooding

714
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:00,870
it's helping helping reduce the impacts

715
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:04,109
of drought and it's helping reduce

716
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:06,629
erosion we also looked at amendments

717
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:11,429
here which referred to mostly manure

718
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:14,010
compost biochar and we're seeing really

719
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:16,139
not as not as good performance here not

720
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,820
surprisingly but we are seeing a little

721
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:20,039
bit of drought was that resilience there

722
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,679
from the amendments which i think is

723
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:24,360
probably a result of kind of the

724
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,900
mulching effect and moisture retention

725
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:31,700
that mulch can have on the surface and

726
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,700
also the organic matter that it's adding

727
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:37,219
so I'm gonna wrap things up and

728
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:43,239
mention our website here New York soil

729
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:47,230
health org we have funding from Cal's as

730
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:50,829
well as AG in markets and we work with a

731
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:52,990
wide variety of stakeholders just want

732
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:55,509
to mention David Wolfe who's a big part

733
00:34:52,989 --> 00:35:00,009
of this study Matt Ryan Harold Venice

734
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:01,990
are also P is Aaron Bristow is no longer

735
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,630
with us but he worked with us on this

736
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:06,609
quite a bit and then we're also working

737
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:12,099
with Johanna Scalia and Thomas Bjorkman

738
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:15,970
Greg Peck and of course many others as

739
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:18,039
well from NRCS and Cornell Cooperative

740
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:22,689
Extension not to mention nonprofits

741
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:25,840
policymakers people like that so I want

742
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:29,280
to thank you for coming and try to

743
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,280
answer any questions that you might have

744
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:36,139
[Applause]

745
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:57,380
I don't think that was included

746
00:35:54,739 --> 00:36:01,759
I do have actually I should mention I do

747
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:05,358
have copies of the survey and you can

748
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:06,920
see it's one piece of paper so it's it

749
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,558
can get kind of overwhelming when you're

750
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,930
when you're approaching these farmers

751
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,329
and asking them to spend 10 or 15

752
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:17,838
minutes filling out a form that they

753
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:19,849
don't really have to and so it's really

754
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:20,960
struggle to kind of fit everything on

755
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:25,519
here

756
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,690
I think that there were a lot of

757
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:30,889
questions that we would have liked to

758
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:37,639
ask so but you're referring mostly to

759
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:40,909
cover crops right so I mean what would

760
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:47,528
be the what would be the relevance of

761
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:47,528
that in terms of be the economic picture

762
00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:12,528
right yeah I mean the challenge is

763
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:15,349
there's so many different types of farms

764
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:18,048
out there and they've all got different

765
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:19,880
types of equipment they're all planning

766
00:37:18,048 --> 00:37:22,369
a different cover crop mix into a

767
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,869
different cash crop how did you like

768
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:25,869
it's it's really complicated I think

769
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,889
that could be that could be really

770
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,869
useful if you have a targeted pet like a

771
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:34,989
really targeted question and you really

772
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:39,010
target specific like you could say okay

773
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:43,419
say I want to compare the costs and

774
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:45,760
benefits of farmers planting Rai into

775
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:50,740
our interceding Rai in the corn and soy

776
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,470
versus a vegetable grower who's taking

777
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:55,209
something out of rotation and planting

778
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:57,009
peas or something you know like that's

779
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:59,349
even though they're both cover crops

780
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:00,570
they're totally different so I mean

781
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:03,640
that's that's a good point that this

782
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:06,460
this really covers everything and so

783
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:07,838
it's you know that's that's one of the

784
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,329
good things about it is it gives us a

785
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:13,690
big picture but the drawback is we can't

786
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:17,989
really pick out those those details with

787
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:19,720
this type of like broad approach I think

788
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:39,259
there's definitely all kinds of

789
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:39,759
opportunities for that I think it's very

790
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,460
likely

791
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:48,380
so we advertised the survey through

792
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:52,970
newsletters which gets sent into farmers

793
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:55,369
email inboxes so it's yeah it's very

794
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:58,099
it's very much cell selected but I did

795
00:38:55,369 --> 00:39:01,970
also go to a lot of conferences and

796
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:04,219
farmer meetings where there were maybe a

797
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:06,980
hundred people in the room and we all

798
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:08,659
sort of took some time as part of the

799
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:11,809
meeting to do that so I think that was

800
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:13,639
that was a good thing in that it

801
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:16,549
encouraged people who otherwise wouldn't

802
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:18,500
have bothered to fill it out and of

803
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:23,420
course you know like one of the results

804
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:25,519
was 125 of the 182 indicated that they

805
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:29,659
used cover crops which is totally

806
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:32,269
disproportional to the other numbers of

807
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:34,879
of cover crops that we think are out

808
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:37,159
there so it's good for the survey

809
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,760
because we got a lot of responses

810
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:42,949
relevant to these practices but yeah I

811
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,160
think that is an issue and I think that

812
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:48,199
really that really comes into play in

813
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,358
terms of those profitability pie charts

814
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:54,699
because that's not necessarily

815
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:54,699
representative of the entire population

816
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:08,620
Shannon yeah it's a possibility I think

817
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,310
that that would be an interesting way to

818
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:15,849
maybe touch on Peters idea about getting

819
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:17,590
into the nitty-gritty details of the

820
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:20,909
cover crops that are being used and and

821
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:23,220
more suppose the more specific methods

822
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:24,429
yeah that's definitely a possibility

823
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:30,759
Harold

824
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:33,759
so category corn in 20 so there's sort

825
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,500
of a category farmers here in New York

826
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,260
that are corn and soybean growers and

827
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:41,170
are primarily grain growers and then

828
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:47,580
there are dairy farmers who grow corn

829
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:51,010
and right so you separate those out

830
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:53,559
visit ok so I quit I just like minimum

831
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:55,330
tillage dairy farm the needs are

832
00:40:53,559 --> 00:41:00,119
different or cover crops a lot of the

833
00:40:55,329 --> 00:41:03,789
dairy farmers so the categories stages I

834
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:09,099
I think if I'm asking if I understand

835
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:11,349
your question you're asking our silage

836
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:13,750
corn considered the same crop as grain

837
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:18,099
corn right already to say you can ignore

838
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:21,099
the corners maybe include well actually

839
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:25,029
what we did is we so we used I think

840
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:27,219
eight different crop groups here grains

841
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,440
oil seed dry beans corn and soybean for

842
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:34,739
feed tree fruit berry crops etc and

843
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:41,860
those were taken from the census

844
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:46,869
categories I believe so we did specify

845
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:47,829
corn and soybean for feed ok so I think

846
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:51,309
that kind of brings up an interesting

847
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:53,380
point in that the language that you use

848
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:56,679
in the survey is really important

849
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,809
because it's up to the farmer to read

850
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:03,039
what's printed on the paper and try to

851
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:04,809
interpret that so there's definitely a

852
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,929
little bit of kind of wiggle room and

853
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:09,699
maybe you know maybe a farmer just

854
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:11,409
glances over it and puts it in another

855
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:21,779
category or something I

856
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:25,998
um but I guess grain corn could I mean I

857
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:30,048
mean grain corn could be for feed right

858
00:42:25,998 --> 00:42:32,288
I mean the ultimate wreck ultimate place

859
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:35,268
where it ends up maybe maybe four feet

860
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:38,179
but I guess I'm the reason why I bring

861
00:42:35,268 --> 00:42:41,778
it up it is it's forty thirty farmers

862
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:43,759
and they well they often have a

863
00:42:41,778 --> 00:42:46,789
perennial crop in there already and then

864
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:48,469
they they are applying manure and they

865
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:51,229
it's a lot easier for them to establish

866
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:53,208
a cover crop after corn silence because

867
00:42:51,228 --> 00:42:55,158
they have a lot more time a lot of them

868
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:59,778
actually are required to do it because

869
00:42:55,159 --> 00:43:01,818
over their CAFO plan and corn and

870
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:04,159
soybean growers that's a green grower

871
00:43:01,818 --> 00:43:07,068
and a green might end up in an animal

872
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:11,778
somewhere but they they are initially

873
00:43:07,068 --> 00:43:13,969
selling it to an elevator and they have

874
00:43:11,778 --> 00:43:16,548
sores are growing for great horned a

875
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:18,588
corn for breaking story then they have

876
00:43:16,548 --> 00:43:20,809
that long season like you were saying

877
00:43:18,588 --> 00:43:22,128
which is really right because there you

878
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:24,619
go challenge in terms of using the other

879
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:27,469
crops right okay does the cook does the

880
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:29,809
corn have to dry maybe try down a little

881
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:30,199
bit before yeah I mean Simon kid hard

882
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:31,789
was it

883
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:34,999
around this time almost of it's already

884
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:37,369
been harvested grain might stay until

885
00:43:34,998 --> 00:43:39,108
the middle of October and then you might

886
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:43,159
you might be able to get some rind it's

887
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:45,528
just unless you used interested yeah

888
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:49,419
yeah that's that's one of the challenges

889
00:43:45,528 --> 00:43:49,418
of doing a survey like this is trying to

890
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:56,539
cover everything but also not mix things

891
00:43:52,818 --> 00:43:58,880
up too much yeah yeah like for example

892
00:43:56,539 --> 00:44:01,159
you know berries on here could be

893
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,460
blueberries or it could be strawberries

894
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:07,519
ones it's I mean the I guess they're

895
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,260
both perennials but strawberries are

896
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:12,108
treated more as annuals than blueberries

897
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,970
are per se so there's things are kind of

898
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:15,828
lumped together a little bit in ways

899
00:44:13,969 --> 00:44:18,169
that might not necessarily make a whole

900
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:22,130
lot of sense but you kind of have to go

901
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:23,480
with with the resources it resources

902
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,450
that you have in the space and the paper

903
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,190
that you have but again you know that's

904
00:44:26,449 --> 00:44:30,858
that is that could be a whole other

905
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:33,349
study is looking at just corn growers

906
00:44:30,858 --> 00:44:36,529
and and trying to pick apart the

907
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:41,568
different Covercraft practices that are

908
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:44,630
out there for sure Jonathan I have a

909
00:44:41,568 --> 00:44:46,550
question about your time domain you got

910
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:49,160
a lot of responses based upon you know

911
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:50,900
the performance evaluation for a lot of

912
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:51,920
different things but the only time the

913
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,500
main you have is really serve

914
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,818
experiential on the farmers part do you

915
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,659
have anything about when they has

916
00:44:55,818 --> 00:45:01,159
established the whenever's conservation

917
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:02,539
to whatever happens to be the practices

918
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:04,549
that they're putting in so they're

919
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:06,710
rather than experiential time-aligned

920
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:09,109
you actually yeah in practice timeline

921
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:14,929
so you can have some of those types of

922
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:17,239
responses I'm not sure I completely

923
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:18,919
understand the question so you have a

924
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:20,959
grower who's got twenty years of

925
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,880
experience but they've only established

926
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:27,139
I will do whatever happened to the last

927
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,119
five years right okay so yeah so so

928
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:31,969
there could be a difference between how

929
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,680
much experience you have versus how long

930
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:35,358
have you been doing this on your farm

931
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:37,879
right right

932
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:40,759
the way we worded the question I mean I

933
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,170
actually did think of that and the way

934
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,450
we word the question because we wanted

935
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:46,690
we wanted the we wanted to capture the

936
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:49,368
benefits that that person was seeing on

937
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:53,420
the farm that they were reporting for

938
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:55,460
right so there we asked them ask them to

939
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,409
report for their primary farm which we

940
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:00,920
kind of defined a little bit in the

941
00:45:57,409 --> 00:46:04,699
survey so it could be conceivable that a

942
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,680
farmer might have sort of 30 years of

943
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:11,568
experience growing cover crops but

944
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:13,368
recently relocated to their farm and so

945
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:15,469
that was that was kind of a problem that

946
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:17,579
we considered but the way that we worded

947
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:19,299
it was

948
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:20,679
you

949
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:24,430
approximately how many years have you

950
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:26,589
used cover crops on your farm and and we

951
00:46:24,429 --> 00:46:29,109
asked them to report the information on

952
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:30,940
the survey survey for their farm and and

953
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:35,590
so the response in that case would have

954
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:38,829
been 1 to 5 5 to 10 10 to 15 okay right

955
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:40,980
I thought really is hearing some farmer

956
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:44,440
is really experienced of cover crops

957
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:47,740
correct yeah yeah I guess I used that

958
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:50,800
experience as you're right maybe there's

959
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:51,849
a better word for that I actually think

960
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:57,220
that's a better way of getting the data

961
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:59,019
anyway but it could it could be but yeah

962
00:46:57,219 --> 00:47:01,659
but then you're sort of also asking the

963
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:06,460
farmer are they reporting for you know

964
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:08,259
this this other farm that that they do

965
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:10,389
contract work with where they plant

966
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:12,910
cover crops or it just kind of got a

967
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:14,769
little complicated when we started to

968
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:18,909
dig into that issue but that I mean

969
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:21,280
that's that's that's concern for sure is

970
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:48,309
how do you how do you capture the data

971
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:52,810
that you want think Peter right so some

972
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:56,670
people so some respondents said yeah I

973
00:47:52,809 --> 00:48:01,630
have cover crops in my board system

974
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:03,340
basically that's that's a little bit of

975
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:05,800
a gray area I think cuz it could be the

976
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:07,510
cover crop itself they could be growing

977
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,140
sturdy kale as a cover crop and that is

978
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,140
the forage

979
00:48:11,909 --> 00:48:17,548
that was that was definitely a challenge

980
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:22,349
of the survey is like how do we how do

981
00:48:17,548 --> 00:48:24,989
we include those so so some farmers I

982
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:27,509
think assumed oh I'm just I'm just I've

983
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:29,818
got some hay acreage and I'm just making

984
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:32,250
hay and that's a cover crop like I'm

985
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:34,199
keeping the soil covered you know and

986
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:36,659
somebody else might be saying oh I'm

987
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:38,989
actually tilling and then planting

988
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:43,230
alfalfa every five years or something

989
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:44,729
and planting a cover crop in between or

990
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:48,920
something like that so I think that

991
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,920
