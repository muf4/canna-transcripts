1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,859
yeah so similar to last week's speaker

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,280
the last time I was in this room I was

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:11,539
actually defending my PhD dissertation

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,518
and then I was talking of course about

5
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:17,599
mapping in a rabid obtuse and today I'll

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,879
be talking about mapping in tomato he

7
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:22,160
full disclosure I'm not actually a plant

8
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,079
breeder I'm a bioinformatician but a lot

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,789
of the projects that I work on have

10
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,949
direct applications to useful

11
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:30,500
agricultural traits so hopefully that

12
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:32,479
counts and then also Joyce mentioned I

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,268
have a little bit of an heirloom tomato

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,128
obsession so here's my rainbow of

15
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,988
tomatoes from my garden two years ago

16
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:41,689
last summer wasn't so great because it's

17
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:44,119
a bit wet and various disease problems

18
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:47,839
occurred but two years ago it was great

19
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:51,719
so these are my babies

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:55,920
so I'll be talking about tomato and also

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,929
closely related species today so in this

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,609
phylogeny you can see what I'm

23
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,340
considering members of the tomato clade

24
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,069
so there are 13 species in the tomato

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,350
clade you can see that one of them is

26
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,599
actually missing here but I'll be

27
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:12,089
focusing on these today and there's also

28
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,890
solanum lycopersicum IDs which you can

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,049
see at the bottom of the tree so that

30
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,670
that is also in other species we'll be

31
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,060
talking about today which is an

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,040
out-group so the nice thing about these

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,640
is that they can actually be crossed

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,290
with varying levels of difficulty so the

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,390
ones towards the bottom of the tree tend

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,640
to have selfing at that ability and also

37
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,290
unilateral and compatibility which can

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,500
make it a bit more difficult to cross

39
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,868
those two cultivated tomato ones towards

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,409
the top of the trees towards the top of

41
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:47,519
the tree are tend to be self compatible

42
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:50,219
these are mainly found in western South

43
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,609
America so Peru and Ecuador as you can

44
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:56,000
see a map here see if I can get this

45
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:56,000
thing to work

46
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,859
maybe this there we go so here and

47
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,050
there's also two species that are found

48
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:06,209
in the Galapagos Islands this is a

49
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,639
little bit blurry go up again see and

50
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:16,439
she's mania which are found solely in

51
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:18,298
the Galapagos Islands they look kind of

52
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:19,919
similar the different wild species of

53
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:23,549
tomato you can see some of the diversity

54
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,439
here so have work ideas tends to have a

55
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:28,670
lot of trichomes so it looks kind of

56
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:31,349
fuzzy you can see in the middle here

57
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:33,059
there are some seedlings that we were

58
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,889
growing in our greenhouse at the bottom

59
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,739
you can see however Kai Dee's the

60
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:39,689
reference tomato is something like a

61
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:43,500
first-come Hines so that's growing in

62
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:45,359
the middle of this tray here I don't

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,900
think this is really working and then at

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,890
the top we have pimping Ella folium so

65
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,549
pimping Ella folium is pretty closely

66
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:55,769
related to the cultivated tomato you can

67
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,719
see there's variation in fruit color and

68
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,240
size so the wild species tend to have

69
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,120
smaller fruits and they also tend to

70
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,040
ripen too

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,860
so they never actually changed to Red's

72
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,229
like your typical garden tomato there's

73
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,110
also the two species from the Galapagos

74
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:14,469
Islands cheese mania and go up again see

75
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:19,269
that are orange fruited so that's kind

76
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:22,419
of unique and you see here a number of

77
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:27,009
fruit that we got from Roger at T GRC so

78
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:29,109
he sent those and from there fruits that

79
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:30,669
they grow there so that was that was

80
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:35,310
really nice for one of our experiments

81
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:35,309
and you can see the diversity in color

82
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,150
here's some of our wild species growing

83
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,789
in the greenhouse so you can see that

84
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,460
they're indeterminate so they get quite

85
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:48,679
large they have this sprawling phenotype

86
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,750
as opposed to some of your more common

87
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,909
Gulf cultivated tomatoes which are

88
00:03:50,750 --> 00:04:00,650
determinate and and don't get nearly as

89
00:03:52,909 --> 00:04:02,780
tall so as I said you can cross the wild

90
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,680
species with cultivated tomato and this

91
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,879
turns out to be really useful because

92
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,250
cultivated tomato has undergone three

93
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,389
bottlenecks so there was the original

94
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,479
bottleneck that happened during

95
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:17,060
domestication and then the second

96
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,488
bottleneck happens when they moved to

97
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,920
when they were transported to Europe and

98
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:24,019
then a third bottleneck occurred and

99
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,050
they were transported back to the US for

100
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:30,409
breeding there so it's estimated

101
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:33,829
something like five percent of the

102
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,689
diversity so there's a huge loss of

103
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:37,699
diversity in the cultivated tomato and

104
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:40,040
so what's nice is you can take the web

105
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:42,019
species which which have a lot more

106
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,300
diversity and interesting traits and

107
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:47,870
then you can cross these two to the

108
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:50,960
cultivated tomato and you might think so

109
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,370
here's some more of my Tomatoes you

110
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,810
might think that they're you know

111
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,199
looking at that fruit shape that there's

112
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,030
actually quite a diversity of phenotypes

113
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,620
there but it's actually controlled by a

114
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:05,359
few low sigh so few genes need to sort

115
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:10,790
of this diversity of phenotypes that you

116
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:14,000
see here so the allowed species have

117
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,650
been used and breeding for a number of

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,649
things so this has been happening for

119
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:20,829
the last several decades so they can be

120
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:23,359
used in breeding for disease resistance

121
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:26,389
so you can see one of our collaborators

122
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,790
on a project is interested in tomato

123
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:32,689
yellow leaf virus so he has a cultivar

124
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:34,370
that is resistant to that so you can see

125
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:36,410
in the bottom picture on this line is

126
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,129
called gh 13 the plants in the back are

127
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,169
nice and healthy

128
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:42,788
the resistance and the ones in the

129
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:45,439
foreground are not resistant to curl and

130
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:47,990
today also be talking about bacterial

131
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,219
spec so that's another trait that wild

132
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,300
species have been used

133
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:55,610
to increase resistance to that problem

134
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,370
the weld species can also be used in

135
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,080
quality and nutrition and then some

136
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:06,410
other things like leaf morphology and

137
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:08,269
flowering time so today I'll be talking

138
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,920
about some different projects that we've

139
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:12,229
had and the common theme and all of

140
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,500
these is using bioinformatics approaches

141
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,750
to map genes of interest and tomatoes

142
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,750
and their wild relatives so the first

143
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,720
thing I'll talk about is defining

144
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,720
introgression boundaries and this

145
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,400
started originally is something else and

146
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,210
when I first came to Lucas's lab as a

147
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:34,189
postdoc we were handed the sequence from

148
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:36,199
go up against easily annum go up against

149
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:39,139
e so this was an interesting species

150
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,389
because like I said it came from the

151
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,240
Galapagos Island so it evolved in

152
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,860
relative isolation until recently except

153
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,379
for a couple other species that were

154
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,350
finds in the island it's very closely

155
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:53,509
related to like a purse to comb and most

156
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,250
of the work done at that time and even

157
00:06:53,509 --> 00:07:01,819
now it's it's a bit unclear where it

158
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:03,800
falls on the tree so the go up against

159
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:05,659
he actually falls here with cheese mania

160
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,569
eyepin Piniella folium and lycopersicum

161
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,870
so it's a little unclear how these

162
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:15,409
species are related whenever you do

163
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,149
phylogeny x' so we wanted to do some

164
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:21,080
work to try to clarify that using the

165
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:23,299
genome sequence and also since we knew

166
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,728
that Heinz which is our reference genome

167
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,949
has pimping Ella folium and its

168
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:30,918
parentage we also wanted to figure out

169
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:32,478
where and the reference genome Hines we

170
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,329
could find introgression x' from pimping

171
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:38,029
ella folium so in order to do that we

172
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:39,918
selected an old heirloom line yellow

173
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:42,559
pair so you can see another one of my

174
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,478
garden pictures there so this is an old

175
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,250
heirloom line that existed prior to

176
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,560
modern breeding programs so it should be

177
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:52,149
free of introgression so this was our

178
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,149
control basically

179
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:57,719
to do this we devise a pipeline that's

180
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,720
that's adapted from wait a tall paper

181
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,900
that came out in 2009 so we had five

182
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,970
different species that we looked at so

183
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:08,698
we had the reference signs genome that

184
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,759
we used to map all of our resequencing

185
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:14,310
data on - we had the go up again see

186
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,620
pimping Ella folium data that came from

187
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,300
the tomato genome project so that was

188
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,280
publicly available

189
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,160
we had our yellow peri sequencing data

190
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,829
and then of course potato sequence is

191
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,889
available at the time so we mapped all

192
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:32,879
these to Heinz the resequencing data -

193
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:34,918
Heinz and then we created genomes from

194
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,519
these so we substituted in the snips in

195
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:40,769
any place we had a gap we mask those out

196
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,269
we also then masked with repeat masker

197
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,098
so we could get rid of any repetitive

198
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:46,919
regions that we couldn't be really sure

199
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,750
where they mapped to Heinz then we did

200
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,778
whole genome alignments with these five

201
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,799
species we ran helps you tried to

202
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:56,850
delimit where the phylogenetic

203
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:59,039
breakpoints were occurring along along

204
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,589
the alignments then each one of these

205
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,740
partitions we ran this Derby is on to

206
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:08,010
determine a tree for that partition and

207
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,690
then all these trees were mapped back on

208
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:11,730
to the Hines genomes that we were able

209
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:16,100
to see where a change in topology

210
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:19,200
occurred along the chromosome in

211
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,750
conjunction with that we also plotted

212
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,089
the density of snips across the Hines

213
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,549
genome so this was resequencing data so

214
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,709
we used a standard snip calling pipeline

215
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:31,349
map the data called snips and then we

216
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:34,049
put these into bins of ten kilobases and

217
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,540
then we plotted the density of snips

218
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:39,149
along the chromosome so here you can see

219
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:41,370
at the at the top of the diagram or at

220
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:44,309
the picture we have on yellow pear and

221
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:47,159
then the the second species is go up

222
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:49,500
again see and the third is folium so if

223
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:52,980
you look at yellow pear where where that

224
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,169
red circle oval is you see there's sort

225
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,720
of this little peak and the snip density

226
00:09:55,169 --> 00:10:02,629
and then if you come down to the last

227
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,629
plot you see that there's a reduction in

228
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,060
so that's a putative introgression

229
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,370
and

230
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:10,439
we took that location and then also used

231
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,549
our data from the whole genome plots we

232
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,730
found that there was a change in

233
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:18,750
topology so you would expect Heinz and

234
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:20,250
yellow pair to be clustered together in

235
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,559
the tree since they're actually both

236
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,200
from lycopersicum so that's sort of the

237
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,029
expected topology if you move on to

238
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,920
topology too you see that it's flipped

239
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:32,399
so now Heinz is actually closer to pin

240
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:34,500
Piniella folium so this is indicative of

241
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,959
an inch regression and then when you go

242
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,659
outside that little blip you see it goes

243
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,700
back to the original topology so by

244
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,949
using this method we were able to find

245
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,540
four regions in the Heinz reference

246
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,360
genome where there introgression x'

247
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:50,639
have occurred so one is on chromosome

248
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,610
four we're not really sure what that is

249
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,350
it might just have been happenstance we

250
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,779
don't know of any known resistance genes

251
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:01,320
that are in that region and chromosome 9

252
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:04,019
we have verticillium genes so we were

253
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,970
able to find introgression from pin

254
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,889
panella folia that in Piniella folium

255
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:12,240
that introduced those genes into Heinz

256
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:14,460
and then we have the I gene for Fusarium

257
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,889
wilt resistance on chromosome 11 so we

258
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,440
were able to delimit the introgression

259
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:21,809
x' for each of these genes and Heinz

260
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,030
which now is really useful because Heinz

261
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:26,189
is our reference for other things that

262
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:27,929
we're going to do so we want to be able

263
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,250
to rule out these introgression x' that

264
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,709
are occurring in our in our reference

265
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,720
genome so that we we don't think that

266
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,280
they're something of interest in the

267
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:43,050
population that were that we're actually

268
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:45,899
looking at okay so now I'll talk a bit

269
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:47,579
about napping a single gene I'm using a

270
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,159
mapping mapping population with the

271
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,470
close relative the Heinz

272
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:55,620
so this was some some work done by Sarah

273
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,629
Hines and Greg Martin's lab and it was

274
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,000
really fortuitous because we had just

275
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:01,559
sequenced yellow pair and Sarah shows up

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,200
in my office and says you just found

277
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,299
this interesting phenotype with yellow

278
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,540
pair and I heard you have the sequence

279
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:11,429
so it got off to a really good start and

280
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:13,919
so the phenotype is that yellow pair

281
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:15,599
actually has reduced resistance to

282
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,549
bacterial infection which you can see

283
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,740
here on the leaf on the right you can

284
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:24,019
see much more symptoms of

285
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:26,220
then on the on the leaves on the left so

286
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:29,179
this is great because we had the

287
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,440
sequence so we can go ahead and try to

288
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:37,709
find some candidate genes for this

289
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:39,210
phenotype and just to remind you again

290
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:41,639
this tree is really blurry but the two

291
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,710
arrows are pointing to like a Persico

292
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,319
and pin Vennela folium so these are two

293
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,180
very closely related species and these

294
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,660
are the two species that were used in

295
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:54,299
the cross so le 1589 is pimping ella

296
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,500
folium and that is the same accession

297
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,559
that was used in the tomato genome

298
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,029
project so we had C punts for that we

299
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,879
had the yellow pair from our previous

300
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:05,399
work and so Sarah cross these two to

301
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,789
develop the mapping population and then

302
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,129
she took all the susceptible she took a

303
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:16,079
batch of susceptible plants which we use

304
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:19,350
for the next step of the analysis this

305
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:23,759
was our overview of the pipeline that we

306
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:25,500
use to identify the gene so the first

307
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,779
thing was to take those susceptible

308
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:31,470
plants so Sarah put them in two batches

309
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:33,929
of 13 plants and three pools so those

310
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:37,200
were then sequenced on one lane of

311
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:39,179
aluminum and those were mapped onto the

312
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,400
yellow pear genome so from her previous

313
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:43,109
work and they go up against e project we

314
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:47,399
already had a yellow pear genome so we

315
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:49,950
mapped these reads from from her samples

316
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,500
onto yellow pear and then we called

317
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:54,810
snips so whenever we call snips the

318
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,179
snips that we find should be coming from

319
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:59,129
Pimpin ella folium so they should be

320
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,589
pimpin ella folium and then we plotted

321
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:04,799
these the frequency of these across the

322
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,690
chromosome and then once we had a region

323
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:11,579
of interest then we went in to see what

324
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:14,430
actual genes were there so this is from

325
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:17,160
her paper and that's what the plotting

326
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:18,809
of the frequency look like from pimping

327
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:22,049
ella folium as we go across the

328
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:23,419
chromosomes and if you look at try to

329
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:26,789
use this thing again there we go

330
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:29,909
chromosome four which is great

331
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:31,679
where my red thought was briefly you'll

332
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:33,778
see that there is a reduced frequency of

333
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,588
pimping ella pimpin out for you

334
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:39,899
Oh Liam snip in the dense it's frequency

335
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:42,120
of the snips and it drops off towards

336
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:44,879
the beginning of the chromosome so that

337
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,068
was our region of interest to try to

338
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,379
find the gene that's responsible for

339
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:52,019
this phenotype so the really great thing

340
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,730
about that was that as I said we had the

341
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:56,159
yellow pair we had the panzanella folium

342
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,759
we went into that region and we look for

343
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:02,850
any snips that were causing a change in

344
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,889
the and the coding sequence and so what

345
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,800
we found is that there was one gene and

346
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:09,778
yellow pair that had some deletions that

347
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,508
were causing a shift frame shift in the

348
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:13,889
coding sequence and that was only

349
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:15,870
happening in yellow pair it wasn't

350
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:19,318
happening in pin Fenella folium or Hinds

351
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:21,299
or the other accession that we looked at

352
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:25,169
so this is a pretty good indication that

353
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:27,120
that that was our G so we developed some

354
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:29,849
markers and Sarah went on to do some

355
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,679
fine mapping to confirm and it does turn

356
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,659
out that that was the actual gene

357
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,028
conferring the phenotype and then she

358
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,909
went on to do a number of very elegant

359
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:41,308
experiments in the lab to elucidate what

360
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:42,659
what this gene is actually doing if you

361
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:49,620
want to know more about that I'd highly

362
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:52,620
recommend reading for paper alright so

363
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:56,188
the next thing another project is moving

364
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,470
onto qtls and here we're mapping to an

365
00:15:56,188 --> 00:16:00,688
intermediate relative so not not as

366
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:04,350
close to cultivated Tomatoes with an L

367
00:16:00,688 --> 00:16:05,969
folium and this was some where we're

368
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:10,170
coming out of Greg's lab so a former

369
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:12,269
postdoc in his lab C long bao notice

370
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:15,318
that in this particular accession of

371
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:18,269
Habra Tydeus we have resistance to

372
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:21,028
Pseudomonas so you can see and the leaf

373
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:23,399
on the left looks nice and clean and

374
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:25,558
then you can see the really susceptible

375
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,328
one on the right and then there was also

376
00:16:25,558 --> 00:16:30,178
an intermediate phenotype here which you

377
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:31,769
can see in the in the middle so again

378
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:35,458
keep in mind this is a little bit more

379
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:38,039
distant species that we're using in this

380
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,479
study so the reason that's important to

381
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,750
keep in mind is that some of these

382
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,250
issues with detecting recombination and

383
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,990
then also using Hines as a reference

384
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,990
genome gets a little bit more tricky

385
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:56,899
so this is from his paper an overview of

386
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:58,699
how we did the analysis so he mapped PT

387
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:02,840
OS which is essentially cultivated

388
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:06,500
tomato to Hobart IDs developed an f1 and

389
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:09,709
then f2 population f2 s were bar coded

390
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:13,150
individually and then sequenced and then

391
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:15,680
we align these two Hinds we called snips

392
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,470
one of the problems we ran into is that

393
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:21,519
the read depth was a bit on the low side

394
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:25,640
so we had to create a tool that would

395
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,230
actually create bins of genotypes as you

396
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,210
go across the chromosome so since the

397
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,910
snip density was so low as oftentimes

398
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:35,240
difficult to accurately call

399
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:37,279
heterozygous sites so by taking an

400
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,990
average across the bin we were able to

401
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,149
determine what the overall consensus

402
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,160
genotype should be for a region so that

403
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:47,320
was how we handled the low low coverage

404
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:50,990
data in this case so then we took those

405
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:53,659
average genotype calls and went on to

406
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:57,769
perform standard linkage analysis with

407
00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:00,110
our QTL so in doing that we found some

408
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:02,389
we found a region on chromosome 2 in a

409
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:05,119
region on chromosome 8 the region on

410
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,530
chromosome 8 ended up being basically

411
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,750
the whole chromosome and there was very

412
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:12,279
little recombination there so he decided

413
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:15,109
to move forward with chromosome 2 since

414
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:19,819
it was a little bit more more

415
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:21,529
approachable so we went on similar to

416
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:25,549
Sarah's project to design some markers

417
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:27,079
so we used the fabric ID sequence that

418
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:29,960
we had from the resequencing because

419
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:33,529
there isn't an abra Katie's genome like

420
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,539
there is for Hines and so we develop

421
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:38,690
some markers based on his sequence and

422
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:41,889
then he was able to find that to about a

423
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:44,269
1 mega base region on chromosome 2 and

424
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:47,000
there are a number of genes candidate

425
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:49,639
genes there that he did some further

426
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,799
work on to look at expression it was a

427
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,230
little bit tricky though so this this

428
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:56,389
project was obviously more tricky than

429
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,910
the fo3 project for a couple of reasons

430
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,440
first of all we're looking at a QTL so

431
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,729
we don't have this single strong effect

432
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,399
locus

433
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:06,558
and also as I mentioned it's a more

434
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:08,958
distant cross so we had this problem

435
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,628
with reduced recombination and some of

436
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:13,070
the chromosomes and then also there

437
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:14,838
isn't a have work IDs referenced you

438
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:17,058
know so whenever you're doing something

439
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:19,519
like this if you don't have a reference

440
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:22,388
genome for both of the parents you don't

441
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:25,038
really know what is in that in that

442
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:27,228
segment there so it's possible that

443
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,999
there could be genes that are in there

444
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:31,459
that aren't in hinds all of these gene

445
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:34,278
models were predicting from the hinds

446
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:37,489
annotation so we know that oftentimes

447
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:40,038
resistance genes they can be rapidly

448
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:43,190
evolving and they can change by copy

449
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:45,169
number so what would be of interest is

450
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,269
to have a hyper kinase genome to see if

451
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:49,399
those same genes are actually found in

452
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:53,959
hauberk IDs in that region so this was a

453
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:55,458
good good experience for us to give us

454
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:59,359
sort of the rationale for having a

455
00:19:55,459 --> 00:20:06,459
reference genome for other projects so

456
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:10,308
sort of alluding to another project here

457
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:11,839
so knowing now we know that having a

458
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:15,009
reference genome for the more divergent

459
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:17,569
tomato species is really helpful we

460
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:22,069
moved on to a project with like a person

461
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:23,868
so this is a very divergent species so

462
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:27,218
it's actually an out-group to the tomato

463
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:29,358
clade and you can still cross it with

464
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:32,989
cultivated tomato but it's a bit more

465
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:35,178
difficult and it's interesting so this

466
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:37,338
this was also another nice accident so

467
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:40,129
there was a postdoc there still as a

468
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:42,440
postdoc in Jim Jim and Tony's lab that

469
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:46,118
was doing some work on the like a purse

470
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,528
acquittees inch regression lines out and

471
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:51,408
and I feel that they're you currently

472
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:55,578
using this is a couple years ago and it

473
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:59,359
was really good conditions for spec that

474
00:20:55,578 --> 00:21:02,088
year so re the postdoc was interested in

475
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:04,908
in looking at some fruit quality related

476
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:07,578
things in the in theone introgression

477
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:09,829
lines but since the conditions respect

478
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:11,418
were really good he was able to see that

479
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:15,069
there was some some plants that were

480
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:16,660
actually resistant to the spec so now

481
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:20,139
it's super interesting because it has

482
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:23,290
two really cool things going on now so

483
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:26,470
we wrote a proposal to the tryout triad

484
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:29,379
foundation at that we have it BTI and

485
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,990
rewarded a bit of money to to pursue

486
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,900
this project so you can see here than

487
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,220
the introgression lines where they've

488
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,530
found various low side that are involved

489
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:44,289
either in fruit quality so carotenoid

490
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:45,910
biosynthesis or pathogen resistance so

491
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:49,779
with the triad what we were able to do

492
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:52,500
is make the genome for like a purse of

493
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:54,700
quality so we were able to sequence it

494
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,619
using our funds which was really great

495
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:01,000
because it's really helped a lot of our

496
00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:05,079
downstream work so what we did was we

497
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,380
sequenced the genome at about ATX

498
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:10,960
coverage using PacBio sequence and then

499
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,429
we corrected those reads so if you're

500
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,230
not familiar with pat bio and it's a

501
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:16,540
very very high error rate so the first

502
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:19,599
thing you need to do with it is map all

503
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:21,730
of the map the reads to the longest

504
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:24,009
roughly 20% of the reads and then

505
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,679
correct those reads so that's what you

506
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:31,390
use for assembly we tried two different

507
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:33,640
assembly tools so Falcon is known as the

508
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:36,070
diploid assembler and then we also tried

509
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,830
Kenya which is a modified version of

510
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:40,928
Solaris onblur that's used for PacBio

511
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:42,789
so we ran two different assemblies

512
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:45,970
actually many different assemblies using

513
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:49,329
two different tools and we found based

514
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:52,509
on n 50 values average length you know

515
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:54,869
the resulting assembly size that the

516
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:58,150
Kent can new assembly was the better one

517
00:22:54,869 --> 00:23:00,729
so we move forward at that and we did

518
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:03,160
polishing using both the PAC bio reads

519
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,200
and then also we had Illumina reads so

520
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,150
we we mapped all those onto our genome

521
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,150
and tried to remove as much of the error

522
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:13,750
as possible because PacBio often leave

523
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:16,660
in Dells so those obviously you don't

524
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:20,890
want to have and then we took that

525
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:23,169
polished assembly and we use that we

526
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:26,850
sent that off to dovetail to do hi-c and

527
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:28,980
also there Chicago libraries

528
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:31,278
and that was magical because whenever we

529
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,538
got that back it is chromosome length

530
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:37,288
assembly so we basically have our

531
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:38,730
assembly and 12 pseudo molecules once we

532
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:40,919
got that back then we just did a little

533
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:43,230
bit more work to fill in gaps because

534
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,389
the hi-c will create gaps in the genome

535
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,159
which are just ends so you can take your

536
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:48,839
PacBio reads and again map them and

537
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:54,630
sometimes you can span those gaps and

538
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:56,879
fill in the missing sequence so this is

539
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:59,879
what our assemblies are looking like so

540
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:09,049
far compared to the published pignoli I

541
00:23:59,878 --> 00:24:09,048
and the publish lycopersicum genomes so

542
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,879
you can see that the hi-c did a great

543
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:16,769
job we didn't have really any good

544
00:24:14,878 --> 00:24:20,428
genetic Maps to use for like personally

545
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:23,278
so the hi-c was able to pull in all of

546
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:24,950
these scaffolds and get our genome

547
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,960
assembly up the pseudo molecule level

548
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:30,058
the longest sequence and like a persica

549
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,669
Lidia's it's 133 mega bases so that's

550
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:35,668
basically a whole chromosome which is

551
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:37,559
really great hunting size is huge which

552
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:39,179
is again good because we want to predict

553
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:41,308
gene models so if you don't have really

554
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:47,429
long stretches that continuous sequence

555
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:49,619
you're not and the total length is is

556
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:52,169
comparable to what we expect the genome

557
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:55,258
size to be for like a person quiz so

558
00:24:52,169 --> 00:25:00,809
we're pretty happy with our results for

559
00:24:55,259 --> 00:25:03,210
this this genome these are this is sort

560
00:25:00,808 --> 00:25:05,369
of a standard analysis that's done with

561
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,230
with genome assemblies and also

562
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:10,168
annotations to give you an idea of how

563
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,339
complete your your genome assembly is so

564
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:13,470
these are genes

565
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:15,449
Kuzco or a set of genes that should be

566
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:18,028
universally conserved and they should be

567
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:20,490
present in single copy and the plant

568
00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:22,319
lineage so you you look for these in

569
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:26,490
your genome to see how many of them you

570
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:28,769
can find and you can see so a 29 one

571
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,569
that's like a person ladies and you can

572
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:33,058
see that we have very very few missing

573
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:35,369
we actually have fewer missing than if

574
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:38,369
you run the same analysis on tomato 2.5

575
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:40,919
so it's not really statistically

576
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:43,409
significant but it's it's pretty cool

577
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,310
and then these three other assemblies in

578
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,769
blue or other

579
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:48,359
PacBio assembly as we did with coffee so

580
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:52,559
I just have those there as a basis of

581
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,329
comparison and overall things are

582
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,339
looking really good we do have a bit of

583
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:59,159
a higher duplication level and like a

584
00:25:56,339 --> 00:26:01,919
person ease of the boosts go set but I

585
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,600
find that if I remove so whenever you do

586
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,720
the hi-c you get your pseudo molecules

587
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,879
and then you get some other sort of

588
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,220
context that weren't pulled in so if I

589
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,530
remove those that number drops and I

590
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,730
think a lot of that stuff that didn't

591
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:17,069
get pulled in is actually another

592
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,630
haplotype that was assembled of course

593
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:21,480
there's also probably chloroplasts in

594
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,070
there as well but that would be what

595
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,110
would be causing this this duplication

596
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:26,579
because like a person Queenie's it's

597
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:29,339
very heterozygous so we would expect

598
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:30,659
that there would be some cases where the

599
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:37,109
two haplotypes didn't get merged

600
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:40,230
together and they assembly all right so

601
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:43,229
of course what people really care about

602
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:45,779
with genome assemblies is finding the

603
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:49,970
genes so our next step was to run

604
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:52,529
software called maker so maker works by

605
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,740
first you repeat master genome because

606
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:58,139
it's you leave the repeats in there it

607
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:02,370
confuses the gene prediction software so

608
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:05,640
you repeat repeat mask and then you

609
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:08,159
train some ab initio gene predictors so

610
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,440
we used a Gustus and snap so you train

611
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,370
those with a training set so that you

612
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,019
have a model for what the genes should

613
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:18,089
look like for the particular species

614
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:21,059
that you're annotating and you put all

615
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:23,129
this into maker you also give it EST is

616
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:25,440
RNA seek data all kinds of expression

617
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:28,470
data basically feed that into maker and

618
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,250
then it'll give you a bunch of predicted

619
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,839
gene models that are never 100% correct

620
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:38,099
but they're a good starting point of

621
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:41,519
where coding regions should be so and we

622
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:43,829
did that we got about almost 38,000 gene

623
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,329
models though this is comparable to what

624
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:47,599
you see in Familia and like a person

625
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:50,599
come they should be pretty similar and

626
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:54,168
then we took these and then we tried to

627
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:57,829
do functional prediction with those

628
00:27:54,169 --> 00:28:01,700
you know what are they likely to encode

629
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:04,460
and we use this using blast sequence

630
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:08,259
similarity and then also InterPro scan

631
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,259
which looks for domains in the protein

632
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:14,089
and this is a nifty little tool that

633
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,700
we're really trying to encourage people

634
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:20,538
to use so as I said with the annotation

635
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,639
you never have things 100% accurate so

636
00:28:20,538 --> 00:28:25,970
one way of helping with that is to set

637
00:28:22,638 --> 00:28:28,278
up these instances of web Apollo and so

638
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,350
users can come in and actually edit

639
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:33,079
their gene of interest so that's that's

640
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:35,209
what this is here so basically what you

641
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:36,798
have of your gene model up at the top

642
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,350
that's the predicted gene model from

643
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,839
maker and then you have tracks below

644
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:44,689
that show all of your RNA seek data we

645
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,730
had Isis secure I used to see a sequence

646
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,440
that comes from PacBio sequence and

647
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,579
what's nice about it is it should in

648
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,739
those cases give you a full-length

649
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:54,499
transcript so those are really good for

650
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:57,379
annotation we have RNA seed from

651
00:28:54,499 --> 00:29:00,259
different tissues and all you need is an

652
00:28:57,378 --> 00:29:02,148
account so we have this set up for

653
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:03,858
cultivated tomato - if any of you are

654
00:29:02,148 --> 00:29:07,189
working on that and are interested in

655
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:08,778
particular genes you can contact us and

656
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,149
we can set you up with an account you

657
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:13,249
can go in and actually change gene

658
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:14,928
models and correct them and all this

659
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:16,220
goes into a database and then whenever

660
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:17,749
we release a next version of the

661
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,350
annotation all of your changes will be

662
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:20,350
incorporated

663
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,870
and I just thought I'd throw this out

664
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,058
there in case any of you are interested

665
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:29,979
in like a Persico eighties we will be

666
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:32,230
making this publicly available and the

667
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,360
next week or two so this will be

668
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:39,579
pre-publication it'll be free for anyone

669
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:46,240
to use as long as you agree to and it'll

670
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:49,649
be on sole genomics database so you can

671
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,650
let me know if you're interested in that

672
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:56,859
alright so now that we have this genome

673
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,080
we want to move forward with with the

674
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:01,178
projects to look at these genes that are

675
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:03,730
involved in disease resistance and fruit

676
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:06,400
quality so how do we do that

677
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:09,640
so we developed a pipeline for making

678
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:13,570
for predicting for creating markers to

679
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:16,030
map traits and in these crosses so since

680
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:19,240
like a person CODIS and like a Persico

681
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:21,759
more so divergent oftentimes it's

682
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,140
difficult to get enough recombination if

683
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,410
you have if you generate enough to

684
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,570
actually map genes very well so one of

685
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:31,630
the things that was done was to cross

686
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:34,109
like a purse of COI T's to Pei which is

687
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:37,120
a little bit closer so we can actually

688
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:40,539
get more recombination and and find that

689
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:43,539
gene so because of this I did we made

690
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:46,839
the pipeline so that it would give us

691
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:48,549
markers that are for use in crosses

692
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:50,199
between like a purse acquittees and

693
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:54,159
pinellia and crosses between like a

694
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,319
personal use and Heinz so we mapped like

695
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,070
a purse acquiesce to the published

696
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:02,678
finially i genome and Heinz genome and

697
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:04,359
then we used mummer for that and then we

698
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,250
took those results and we identified any

699
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:09,178
region where we had an end all that was

700
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:12,369
greater than 30 base pairs but less than

701
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:15,759
200 and those parameters can be tweaked

702
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:18,189
but that's what we used and then we use

703
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:21,549
primer 3 just to design primers on

704
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:23,410
either side of that endo that we could

705
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:26,279
use to distinguish differences in the

706
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,720
aptitude population excuses markers and

707
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,730
to confirm that these would actually

708
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,289
work in PCR then we took them and we

709
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,420
blasted them back to the respective

710
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:35,889
genomes because

711
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,470
since the genomes are quite different

712
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:40,030
sometimes the primers wouldn't match a

713
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,250
hundred percent or sometimes they would

714
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:44,980
map too far apart or do something

715
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:49,000
unexpected so it's important to do that

716
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:52,720
last step and so in doing that for like

717
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,480
a purse acquittees and ping-mei we have

718
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,980
about thousand markers and for like a

719
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,980
purse acquittees and like a purse to

720
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:02,349
comb we've got about 600 markers and the

721
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,690
reason there's less for like a purse

722
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:06,309
acquittees and like a purse economy

723
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,620
because again they're more divergent so

724
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:11,980
less things aligned then also and we

725
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:13,359
would blast the primers back since we

726
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,920
were predicting them on one genome

727
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,049
oftentimes those primers wouldn't match

728
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,460
100% and the other genome so there are

729
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:19,990
some tweaks we can make to the pipeline

730
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:26,620
to brought a lot more markers if we

731
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:30,069
needed to all right so the last mapping

732
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:34,599
approach that this is a work in progress

733
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:38,589
as well and again a collaboration with

734
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:42,549
with Greg Martin's lab is to see how we

735
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:49,049
can use G was and tomato to look look at

736
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:51,730
novel disease phenotypes so for this

737
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:54,639
there is a lot of data that's publicly

738
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:57,759
available for various tomato lines and

739
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,250
also wild species I'm Fenella folium so

740
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:03,009
we've taken advantage of this so there's

741
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:05,980
a paper where they see plants 360 lines

742
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:10,539
there's most of those were like a purse

743
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:12,549
accom there's another dataset of 100

744
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:16,029
line some of those include wild species

745
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:18,519
and then we also have snip chip data and

746
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:22,359
some other things that were just put

747
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:25,450
into the SRA NCBI mm-hmm so we took all

748
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:29,199
of this data and we generated this big

749
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:31,180
tree from all of it and this this isn't

750
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,150
that tree but it kind of gives you the

751
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:36,789
idea this is a subset of those

752
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:39,100
accessions that which is a little bit

753
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:41,259
easier for presentation purposes but it

754
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:43,179
gives you some idea of how things sort

755
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:44,680
of fall out so it's how you would expect

756
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:48,100
like a person combs cluster together

757
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:51,610
then you have your landraces

758
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:54,279
here by the star and heirloom lines the

759
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:55,869
blue is sarasu for meso sarasu for me is

760
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:57,519
generally believed to be admixture

761
00:33:55,869 --> 00:34:00,849
between some vanilla folium and like

762
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,970
Persico then the green at the top we

763
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:06,009
have pimping Ella folium and then the

764
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:10,148
yellow is some more divergent wild

765
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:14,190
species so this was useful because now

766
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:17,019
we can select from these clusters

767
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:18,608
representatives to do for to use for

768
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:21,009
screening so we want to get a broad

769
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:23,679
picture of the diversity that's present

770
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:28,540
in tomato based on this work with the

771
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:30,820
resequencing data so Sara Hein

772
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:35,789
too was a postdoc in Greg's lab and

773
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:38,169
Samantha have that work to select

774
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:40,300
samples from this tree and then to

775
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:41,799
procure seed for them so I think right

776
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,530
now in Sandy's office they're running

777
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:49,659
like a whole germ plasm storage center

778
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:52,510
there's a lot of seed from this and then

779
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:55,628
Robin and Holly are also in Greg's lab

780
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:59,020
are involved in screening so they're

781
00:34:55,628 --> 00:35:00,880
screening for a novel phenotypes

782
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:08,079
pathogen phenotypes of Pseudomonas

783
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:09,490
responses to Pseudomonas and what's

784
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,829
really nice is that since we have all

785
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:14,199
the sequence data and now we're getting

786
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:16,750
these phenotypes a tie-in with it we can

787
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:19,019
try to use G was to get at the low side

788
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:24,639
they were causing these interesting

789
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:28,989
responses so this is some work done by

790
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:31,989
Adrian Powell and he's been using so the

791
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:34,239
first thing that he tried to do was we

792
00:35:31,989 --> 00:35:37,779
know F ls3 is involved in pathogen

793
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:41,019
response we have sequence from a number

794
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,720
of individuals or non responders and lot

795
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:45,579
more who were responders so taking all

796
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:48,579
the sequence data and the phenotypes

797
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:50,019
that we already have he did some work to

798
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:52,659
see if we could actually detect the

799
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:54,940
known G and you can tell from the

800
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:57,009
Manhattan plot he was able to do this

801
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:00,400
there is a bit of noise but you see this

802
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,790
nice strong peak on chromosome 4 and if

803
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,380
you

804
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:04,000
you zoom into where that is occurring

805
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,220
that actually is at the Ethel s three

806
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,050
locus so right now

807
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:09,759
Adrian's working on fine-tuning this and

808
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:12,250
then he'll be interested in applying

809
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:19,240
this to the new phenotypes that are

810
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:21,420
coming out of the screen and the last

811
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:25,299
thing I wanted to talk about briefly

812
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:29,050
it's a little bit of advertising for one

813
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:32,380
of our group number so he wrote this

814
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:35,110
program called snip Benner and this is

815
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:38,140
useful for the creation of BIM maps so

816
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:40,750
if you're if you have GPS data or RNA

817
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:43,389
seek data and you generate a lot of

818
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:46,329
snips oftentimes that that can be a bit

819
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:49,029
too much information the bin maps are a

820
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:53,650
way of sort of reducing the complexity

821
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:58,600
of that data so the first thing it does

822
00:36:53,650 --> 00:37:03,070
is he so in this case it's been tested

823
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:06,069
with rails so it takes each line and it

824
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:11,730
looks for the crossover points in each

825
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:14,080
line and then based on on an algorithm

826
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:16,809
it takes those crossover points and

827
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,869
constructs have been mapped from that

828
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:21,369
data and then and also the other thing

829
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:23,889
about it there are some other tools that

830
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:26,349
do some similar things but this one if

831
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:32,469
you have a VCF file it basically will

832
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:33,610
take VCF files from any set color and

833
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:37,089
this is just a little overview of

834
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:39,190
basically how it works so at the top we

835
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,800
have the reel so first it does a step

836
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:45,389
that I'm not showing here where it uses

837
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,250
some hidden markov models to identify

838
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:49,989
the genotype so do you know type Colin

839
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,940
can be messy so it does some work to

840
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:53,949
sort of smooth those out and determine

841
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,590
the recombination breakpoints which you

842
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:59,879
can see at the top and then it uses an

843
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:03,000
algorithm to take those recombination

844
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:07,920
Maps and collapse them into a bin map

845
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,920
which can then be used in QTL mapping

846
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,700
so this has actually been used in a

847
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:17,420
paper that we hope will be coming out

848
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:21,439
soon by ET ganda and jim japanese lab so

849
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:24,260
he used snipping her too in his analysis

850
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,260
of some fruit quality traits and a

851
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:30,050
pimping Ella folium tomato real

852
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,610
population so that will be coming out

853
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,960
soon in the meantime if you really want

854
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,360
to play with a tool it is publicly

855
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,570
available on github so you can go there

856
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:41,090
and try it out so far we've only used it

857
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:44,000
on Rails but I believe that each eye has

858
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:45,800
been testing it out on an f2 population

859
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,150
actually that's two population from that

860
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,430
have work IDs project that I talked

861
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:51,740
about so if you're interested in using

862
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:59,179
it on f2 we can touch base with him and

863
00:38:51,739 --> 00:39:02,989
see see how it's working ok so nearing

864
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:05,210
the end here so as I said I work as a

865
00:39:02,989 --> 00:39:07,039
bioinformatician and I'm very very just

866
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,480
absolutely thrilled that I get to work

867
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:10,130
with all these wonderful people in

868
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,909
molecular labs that are willing to share

869
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:16,250
their data with us and let us let us

870
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:17,960
mine their data for exciting things so

871
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,730
as you probably noticed a lot of this

872
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,039
work was done in conjunction with Greg

873
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:26,269
Martin's lab specifically I'd like to

874
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:29,059
thank Zi long Val who worked on these

875
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:32,179
projects their hind who was the lead on

876
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:35,029
the fo three projects on Samantha who's

877
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:37,489
doing the work with the mapping of the

878
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:39,740
like a person Queenie's genes and then

879
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:41,689
also Robin Holly who are doing this big

880
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:45,379
screen and working with Adria on the G

881
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:48,530
was in the juvenile lab specifically I'd

882
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,480
like to thank Ari who's done a lot of

883
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:52,550
the RNA sequencing for like persik

884
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,159
wienies genome which allowed us to do

885
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:59,269
the gene model prediction e ty who

886
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:02,659
worked with David on the stiffener

887
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:04,280
project and you men who is awesome or

888
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:07,819
any extraction give us really high

889
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,470
quality RNA sequence for their RNA for

890
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:14,300
our Isis leak sequencing for the

891
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:16,339
annotation also the Muller lab who is

892
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,410
always extremely helpful and obviously I

893
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,760
spend a lot of time there and the glove

894
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:22,309
again see work was done when I was a

895
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,980
postdoc in his lab

896
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:28,159
our collab our collaborator Buuren years

897
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,869
ago and specifically Alessandra and his

898
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,059
lab who has helped with the like Persico

899
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:35,329
nice genome project

900
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:37,099
Roger T GRC who always is sending a seed

901
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:41,000
and things that we need to get get our

902
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:43,250
work done and of course the BC BC group

903
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,010
which is joints mentioned is is newly

904
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:48,829
formed so David who wrote the step in

905
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:50,870
our software and Adrian who is doing G

906
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:51,559
was analysis amongst many many other

907
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:54,710
things

908
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:56,659
and so here's David's in the left corner

909
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,610
there and Adrian's on the right and then

910
00:40:56,659 --> 00:41:01,250
there's some photobombing in the middle

911
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:03,230
there and this is a really exciting day

912
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,809
for us because this is when we got our

913
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:08,389
first PC PC server and that empty slot

914
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:10,820
that we're peering into is where our new

915
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:14,059
one terabyte memory server is currently

916
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:15,980
residing it's working very very hard on

917
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:21,199
assembling a milkweed genome for George

918
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:23,719
and ER right now so exciting day and of

919
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,549
course money it's good that you know

920
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:27,980
people give us money to do things so

921
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:30,110
huge thanks the BTI has supported a

922
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,949
number of the things that the BC BC

923
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:36,980
group is doing and a stuff that

924
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:40,730
occasionally does hand out money and the

925
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,329
Triad foundation for like a purse

926
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,420
acquittees

927
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:47,840
project and one last thing

928
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,550
one last advertisement for any of the

929
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,460
grad students and postdocs or really

930
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:54,920
anyone if you are interested or want to

931
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,110
know more about bioinformatics problem

932
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,639
with your project you run this

933
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,740
bioinformatics hour at BTI

934
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:02,210
on Wednesdays 1:00 to 2:00 and Thursday

935
00:42:00,739 --> 00:42:05,959
is 10:00 to 11:00 in the Resource Center

936
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:08,750
where the fish tank is but I hear it's

937
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,909
going away so if you want to stop by

938
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:14,030
during those times it's free you can

939
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:17,299
come and talk to us and maybe we can

940
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:20,750
help you and also we'll be starting the

941
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,250
bioinformatics course on March 13th

942
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,619
so and these are the topics that we'll

943
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:26,840
be covering so if those are things that

944
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:28,670
are useful to you that you'd like to

945
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,890
know more about just send me an email

946
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:35,180
and I can let you know the schedule and

947
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:35,779
and sign you up so I think that's it

948
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:38,279
thank you

949
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:42,109
your attention

950
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,109
[Applause]

951
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:56,420
yeah so he wants something very diverse

952
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,490
process so for the G ones that I

953
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:03,190
mentioned that particular that was just

954
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:03,189
looking within like a personal yeah I

955
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:09,679
think Adrian who is sitting behind you

956
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:12,049
and can you can correct me if I'm wrong

957
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,429
but um I think we're trying to stick to

958
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,840
like a person comb because whenever you

959
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:16,519
add pimping Ella folium then there's

960
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:25,059
structure issues and all these other

961
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:25,059
things so yeah other questions

962
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:39,670
this has been a production of Cornell

963
00:43:33,889 --> 00:43:39,670
University on the web at cornell edu
