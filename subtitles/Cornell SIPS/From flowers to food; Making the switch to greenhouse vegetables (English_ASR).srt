show I'm not Canadian but being from

8
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:31,118
Boston I can give you an earful of

9
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:31,118
unrecognizable pronunciations of words

10
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:40,969
while on that that subject in my in Jets

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:42,710
country or bills country today all right

12
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:51,589
i just wanted to stir the pot a little

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:54,230
bit i'm going to run through okay bill

14
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,660

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:06,650
am I Walker okay I'm going to continue

18
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:10,070
on with a few things built bill started

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:13,130
family business blah blah blah Allen

20
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:16,849
Michigan State 1980 I followed you Ohio

21
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:21,530
State 1982 we've been a lot of miles on

22
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:26,929
our tread but I think everyone here is

23
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:28,368
very energetic energized and and I don't

24
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:31,069
think we need to measure ourselves in

25
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:34,149
terms of years it's more of the energy

26
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:36,920
that we're all trying to share and

27
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:40,519
continue experiencing alright reality

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,060
check folks very shortly this planet

29
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:45,858
will be inhabited by nine billion

30
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,049
individuals my question is how many more

31
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:52,458
until feeding ourselves becomes a

32
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:56,270
problem I saw a very sobering show on TV

33
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:59,028
last week that stated that fifty percent

34
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:06,039
of the Earth's animal species are gone

35
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:06,039
and the decline is is going to continue

36
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:15,500
we're displacing lots of other species

37
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:18,179
how are you going to feed ourselves for

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,400
my personal story I

39
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,469
shifted all of my research activity from

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,069
three years ago where I was only

41
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:29,620
researching ornamental crops to today

42
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,889
where 90% of my research activity is

43
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,140
edible crops and I'll show an aerial

44
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:40,089
photograph of my family's operation and

45
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:42,069
and over in a slide or to the umbrella

46
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,650
project that I'm writing and speaking

47
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:48,009
about I've titled from flowers to food

48
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:51,310
and actually because I grew up on a

49
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:55,269
truck farm as as a youngster and through

50
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,460
high school it's kind of poetic that

51
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,740
it's really not from flowers to food for

52
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,740
me it's a complete closing of a circle

53
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,960
and it started as food we went to

54
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:09,250
flowers when we could not make a living

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:11,439
in New England on the farm and I don't

56
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,300
know how balanced or appropriate

57
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,270
inappropriate whatever adjective you

58
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,189
want to use that now my family's

59
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,240
operation three years ago we shut the

60
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:23,650
doors after 51 years of growing flowers

61
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:28,390
because there wasn't enough margin to

62
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:32,290
keep let's see two brothers me my

63
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:35,739
parents for households going so anyway

64
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:37,829
I'm very excited about opportunities and

65
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:42,300
I want to share that excitement with you

66
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:44,980
after a couple of additional sobering

67
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,870
thoughts a fado wings when they

68
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:50,469
overpopulate host plants and fly to

69
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,629
another we're building rockets today so

70
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:54,939
that when we overpopulate not if but

71
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:58,629
when we overpopulate the planet we can

72
00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:00,909
find a new home a host plant a host

73
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:06,759
planet silly me for thinking that we're

74
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:09,550
any smarter than anything so I do

75
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,310
believe we're smart enough but then I

76
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:16,389
turn on the TV and see a show with a

77
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:18,519
couple that has 17 children and and you

78
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:21,608
know what what is this all about every

79
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,490
one of those souls is precious but I

80
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:28,659
would look at the parents and say I wake

81
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:31,600
up a bit now is our industrial model of

82
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,240
agriculture sustainable we came

83
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,070
back from World War two and applied an

84
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,670
industrial model to our agricultural

85
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:42,699
system because it works so well to get

86
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,069
us through the war and it has served us

87
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:48,219
well in agriculture for two or three

88
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:50,939
generations many of us in this room will

89
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,560
now look at California Arizona

90
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:56,079
agriculture and and say is it

91
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,160
sustainable is it going to be the answer

92
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:03,899
for us I want to continue as seamlessly

93
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:08,470
as I can with chris is Chris's final

94
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:12,069
slide with the uptick in locally grown

95
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,810
and whether it's cut flowers or I'm

96
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:17,040
going to be talking about vegetable

97
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:20,920
production specifically i'll talk about

98
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,439
root crops in plug trays for any of us

99
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,710
that have been growing flower plugs and

100
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,509
ornamentals for most of our careers I've

101
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:31,149
got some real cool pictures to share

102
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:34,930
with you of radishes beets and carrots

103
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:37,779
and how we might be able to hit these

104
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:40,629
locally grown food movement with some of

105
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:42,939
our expertise can we return agriculture

106
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:46,870
to the family farm this is a farmer's

107
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:50,050
market in emmaus Pennsylvania and what I

108
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:53,699
found very interesting with this I'm

109
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:59,259
guessing well that's that's a matriarch

110
00:05:53,699 --> 00:06:01,629
that is a lynchpin a a backbone of our

111
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:04,959
greenhouse industry I've got my mom

112
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:06,579
that's been the central key point the

113
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,279
glue that holds things together I know

114
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:12,159
any other person in this audience that

115
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,199
is on a family-run operation you know

116
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,930
this position that I'm describing I

117
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:20,079
don't know I didn't talk to this group

118
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:23,889
to decide whether or learn whether it's

119
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:26,019
her daughter and son-in-law or her son

120
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:28,870
and daughter-in-law but there's the

121
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:31,629
second generation and then so cool that

122
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:35,920
we've got that third generation waiting

123
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:41,439
in the wings to continue this family

124
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:43,439
farm approach here's a grower less than

125
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,009
an hour from me in

126
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,350
in eastern Massachusetts a

127
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:51,480
multi-generational family farm you can

128
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,160
look out the the glass glazing of

129
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,379
sidewall of the greenhouse and see

130
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,590
traditional outdoor row crop agriculture

131
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:01,079
now this family operation is is an

132
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:04,829
integrated horticultural establishment

133
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:08,579
today where they grew up on the farm had

134
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:10,829
a farm stand build greenhouses got

135
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:13,229
involved and diversified into flowers

136
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:16,199
along with the farm and what's really

137
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:19,950
cool here I stood in there and I saw it

138
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,920
at this point what I determined was the

139
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:25,379
future of some of our agriculture these

140
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:29,189
are baby greens being broadcast zone in

141
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:32,459
rows in open 10-20 trays on a flood and

142
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:35,279
drain or urban flood bench and they were

143
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:39,389
harvesting this this crop in three weeks

144
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:42,209
from so to harvest and they had the farm

145
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:45,389
stand right there on site so that was

146
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:47,909
really cool for me to see the past or

147
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:51,509
the traditional agriculture with with

148
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:54,000
the future few questions would we be

149
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:58,039
healthier eating less but higher quality

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,889
food what did high fructose corn syrup

151
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:05,160
accomplish isn't it nice to see some of

152
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:08,849
the manufacturers now listening and

153
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:13,919
getting away from that input and why

154
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:16,439
does our food have to be so cheap I was

155
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,469
this past Sunday I saw one of the early

156
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:22,139
morning news programs and there was a

157
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,750
segment and I don't have the name of it

158
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:28,649
right but it was it was about the

159
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:35,099
movement to pay migrant farmworkers a

160
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:37,439
more fair wage and how the movement hit

161
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:41,908
its head against the wall for many years

162
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,890
going to the grocery stores saying we

163
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:46,470
need you to pay a little more for the

164
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:49,580
produce so that we can pay the Pickers

165
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,420
and it wasn't until they bypassed

166
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,210
distribution and went right to the

167
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:56,449
consumer that they got the necessary

168
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:59,600
momentum and it is the pro

169
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:02,570
something like fair fair food or

170
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,629
something but it struck me because I

171
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:08,140
have a real issue with why in the United

172
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:12,259
States our food has to be so cheap and

173
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:15,649
why as growers and we it's all about

174
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:18,950
what costs can we take out versus what

175
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:21,110
quality can we put in so the locally

176
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,900
grown food movement with all these

177
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,450
participants increasing I think that's

178
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:30,889
really cool now I'm going to toggle back

179
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:33,710
and forth between a farmer's market in

180
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:36,769
Boulder Colorado that I visited last

181
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:40,040
year and took some really neat pictures

182
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:42,649
I'm going to ask you to from time to

183
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:45,559
time squint your eyes I'm going to show

184
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:47,600
you some really nice produce in the

185
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,629
stalls and stands of the farmers market

186
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,060
and then I'm going to toggle back to my

187
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:55,549
research greenhouse and activities and

188
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:57,439
in the end say is there a difference

189
00:09:55,549 --> 00:10:00,589
between the pictures that we're looking

190
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,250
at this is that aerial up view of the

191
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:09,830
family operation in Massachusetts 55,000

192
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:12,769
square feet down the off the slide when

193
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:15,680
I grew up before this land was sold to

194
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:17,659
settle my grandfather's estate we had

195
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,750
about 10 acres of land that we

196
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:23,600
cultivated and we trucked our produce

197
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:27,220
into Boston if any of you been in the

198
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,370
faneuil hall tourist area of boston

199
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:33,680
before converting it to a tourist

200
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:36,379
location i have memories of driving in

201
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,929
with my dad in the pickup truck loaded

202
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:41,269
with the produce right to those

203
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:43,939
buildings and unloading in the stall

204
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:47,899
where a commission agent would then sell

205
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,060
the produce so at this point we've shut

206
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:52,610
down the family operation one of my

207
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:55,519
brother's is running a few houses for

208
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:58,430
flower production to complement his

209
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:03,019
landscaping activities and I've taken

210
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:05,919
over one house a 2500 foot house for for

211
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:10,189
my research projects inside this house

212
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:13,699
today is completely

213
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:16,430
we retooled for greenhouse hydroponic

214
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:20,500
vegetable and our production nutrient

215
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:24,370
film channels flood and drain benches

216
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:30,110
now this is a 72 plug plug tray of

217
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:32,210
radishes and Marjorie Allen any of us in

218
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,840
research we look back on your careers

219
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:39,250
and you were lucky if we have you know a

220
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:44,030
handful of pictures that we call winners

221
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:48,230
and money shots and this one as a matter

222
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:50,629
of fact is about 20 years old so before

223
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:53,269
I ever thought of researching radishes

224
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:55,189
you know the saying you take the boy off

225
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:58,789
the farm but you don't take the farm out

226
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:01,790
of the boy for years I had a corner of a

227
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:04,969
greenhouse that I would grow fresh

228
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:07,879
vegetables for for just my family's

229
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:10,940
consumption and as I was the one doing

230
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:14,509
the sewing and plug producing on our

231
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:16,250
operation it didn't take long to use my

232
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:19,009
imagination and start growing some

233
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:22,070
radishes so so that that is an old

234
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:25,129
picture and what I found really

235
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:27,020
interesting is I'm going to show you a

236
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:29,299
few more pictures from this past year

237
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:31,519
where I'm digging into the research side

238
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:33,500
of this a little bit more let's talk

239
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,029
about to boulder for a moment look at

240
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,240
all those root crops ladies and

241
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:41,029
gentlemen from the turnips beets the

242
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,220
carrots the colors the freshness the

243
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:47,179
farmers market locally grown food this

244
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:50,090
whole thing I find very exciting I find

245
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:52,549
I'm very fortunate to be able to

246
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:54,889
research the in this area travel around

247
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:58,819
the country and learn and learn as much

248
00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:03,019
as I can about the young generation of

249
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:05,690
consumers that is telling us they want

250
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:07,309
locally grown food they're also telling

251
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:11,630
us that they'd like to eat seasonally

252
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:13,879
and I describe my generation as being

253
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:16,759
spoiled where the grocery store

254
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:19,639
supermarket generation where over our

255
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,659
lives wasn't it so cool that any day of

256
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,269
the year we could go to the grocery

257
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:26,909
or get anything from any place on the

258
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:29,100
planet and now our children are saying

259
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:30,959
that's that's not sustainable Alan

260
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,480
you've referenced your daughter often in

261
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,790
your presentation our children are

262
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,730
probably up similar ages and I'm

263
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:41,039
crediting them when I'm with them saying

264
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:45,509
you guys are fueling this you're going

265
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:48,959
to change the way we feed ourselves this

266
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:51,899
is a picture of a crop of radishes that

267
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,940
I grew last year the long icicle shape

268
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,740
look at the different colors and oh by

269
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:00,030
the way that's a carrot shaped like a

270
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:04,500
radish so one of my messages for fellow

271
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:07,139
growers in the audience is guys this is

272
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,230
the only how far will our imagination

273
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:14,370
take us Alan did a great job talking

274
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:18,330
about reading and and the opportunities

275
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:21,210
that are just there and there's a

276
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:24,570
project I have a second project looking

277
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:27,629
at LED lighting and indoor warehouse

278
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:30,420
food production and in my opinion the

279
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:32,580
reading efforts the cultivars that we

280
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:35,839
need for those production systems are

281
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:40,070
right around the corner waiting for us

282
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:42,870
this is a 5 inch deep nursery blood tray

283
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:46,070
ok let's grow it let's get going we can

284
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:50,250
grow some carrots we can grow some beets

285
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:53,640
this is a the Nanta type carrot with

286
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:57,509
that wide shoulder this is a 50 plug

287
00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:00,539
tray with the 5 inch deep you know

288
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:02,429
intended for nursery stock and that's a

289
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:05,699
that's pretty cool crop now cultivar

290
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:07,679
selection is important so most of the

291
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,890
cultivars that I'm showing pictures of

292
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:13,500
today when I was selecting them in seed

293
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:19,649
catalogs they were always described with

294
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:21,720
the words miniature fast crop you know

295
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:24,860
you don't want to try and grow an 8 inch

296
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,990
long carrot in a 5 inch deep plug tray

297
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,870
but how cool some of these this was a

298
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:34,799
trial with two different cultivars and

299
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,220
and how cool we match up the cultivar

300
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,219
with the

301
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,480
plug traian and we're good to go here's

302
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:45,089
a turnip and I have this picture to

303
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,339
illustrate the following I want to call

304
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:51,300
your attention to the external route mat

305
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:55,230
from that plug tray now anyone in this

306
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:58,889
room who's grown ornamental crop plugs

307
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:02,278
we do we go out of our way to make sure

308
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:06,720
that doesn't happen we don't want roots

309
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:10,769
external to the plug tray I found after

310
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:14,879
one round of work that's exactly what I

311
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:17,698
do want in this crop so we have to turn

312
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:20,699
what we've learned on its ear from time

313
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:24,109
to time and here's where I see

314
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:26,878
production of this group of crops going

315
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:31,740
I'd like to see a new plug trade

316
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:35,188
designed with instead of maximum cell

317
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:38,970
volume that we want for petunias and

318
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:42,149
geranium plugs I'd like minimum cell

319
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:46,620
volume the growing medium in my opinion

320
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:49,769
in this system is only to support the

321
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:52,350
seed and allow it to germinate once the

322
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:55,740
root gets down to the flood end drain

323
00:16:52,350 --> 00:17:00,750
environment this interface is where all

324
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:04,048
action is so I see a new plug trays

325
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:07,288
designed for this type of food crop

326
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:09,689
production where much significantly less

327
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:12,509
growing mix will go into the plug tray

328
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:16,589
because we only need that route to get

329
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:20,338
down to the outside a couple of slides

330
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:24,418
showing how cultivars are different this

331
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:26,818
is a miniature white turnip and it was

332
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:30,210
very easy to harvest with two fingers

333
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:32,190
just pulling it and that fairly weak

334
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:36,509
taproot would slide right out of the

335
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:39,080
ground its mate a red turnip was much

336
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:42,750
different where it's at deeper in the

337
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:45,720
growing mix and you'd need two hands to

338
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,539
remove the roots from that turnip so

339
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,269
there's an opportunity for us and plant

340
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:54,240
readers to develop cultivars that will

341
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:56,940
sit on top of the mix for harvesting

342
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,930
purposes and I always like to show

343
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,759
slides where we can say you know it's

344
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,340
fun to grow plants and it's fun to work

345
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,740
with plants for a living harvest size

346
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:10,379
maturity we certainly need to match

347
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,079
those things up depending on the density

348
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,570
of the cell and how many you're trying

349
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:18,329
to grow in a square foot versus how long

350
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:20,250
are we going to grow them and we can get

351
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:24,240
real cute with this trying to fit round

352
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,920
pegs in square holes two hands weren't

353
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,269
enough to get that out i needed a

354
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:33,240
jackhammer let's go to radishes for a

355
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:36,539
few slides set and this this research

356
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:40,710
this experiment was looking at density

357
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:45,000
and in yield so I had on the left a 72

358
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:47,789
plug tray a 105 and a 128 and after

359
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,549
growing to maturity I removed the tops

360
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:54,149
of the plants to take this picture the

361
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:56,730
72 plug tray the 105 to 128 and then

362
00:18:54,150 --> 00:19:01,350
went a step further harvested Wade did

363
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:06,269
all that so the left-hand row is the 72

364
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:08,399
105 128 if I'm not going to quickly the

365
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:11,940
bottom row is what we'd say is

366
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,680
acceptable market size the largest ones

367
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,650
then in the middle is an intermediate

368
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,220
medium sized radish and then some pea

369
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:23,340
size small radishes up above so as we

370
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:27,049
would predict the the larger cell size

371
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:29,789
the 72 tray produced the highest

372
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:32,240
proportion of large radishes too small

373
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:36,329
and as we got into a tighter

374
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,269
configuration with 128 we had more of

375
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:42,119
the medium and small ok what's it all

376
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:44,220
mean I brought those home and took the

377
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:47,399
marketable ones and sliced them as you

378
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,410
and I do for our salads and instead of

379
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,509
saying these are not marketable the

380
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:54,540
medium and small-sized I started

381
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:56,240
imagining well with a smaller size

382
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,859
radish we don't have to slice it

383
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,170
probably get our fingers before we get

384
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:01,979
the slices of the radish but we might

385
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,990
just cut it

386
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,599
half and sprinkle it on the salad and

387
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,490
then instead of throwing out these piece

388
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:11,490
size they were actually the size of

389
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,960
green olives so I got to thinking this

390
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,230
happened to be after a couple of

391
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,230
home-brewed beers that afternoon and by

392
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,870
the way my garden Helen I used to have a

393
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:24,599
25 x 30 vegetable garden off the end of

394
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:26,759
my house I started home brewing beer

395
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,558
about eight years ago it didn't take two

396
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,129
years for the vegetables to go in the

397
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:34,319
hops too so I've got a wall of hops the

398
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:37,860
size of this screen screaming to be

399
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:41,819
harvest in the next day or two anyways

400
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:44,129
is this imagination why can't we grow a

401
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:47,099
radish that doesn't need to be sliced

402
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:50,840
and sprinkled like a green olive the

403
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:53,939
only downside I see is an oil-based of

404
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:56,250
salad dressing some of these trying to

405
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,610
stab them or the fork might end up on

406
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:03,259
what movie was that where it it ended up

407
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:07,949
on a neighbor's plate alright this is a

408
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:10,589
288 plug tray of radish just to see how

409
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:13,110
far the envelope can be pushed and it's

410
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:17,159
almost blurring a line between being a

411
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:19,769
sprout or being a radish so I'm going to

412
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:23,400
do some work continue there and see

413
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:26,970
where it leads I think some some some

414
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:29,580
growth regulation I'm dying to look at

415
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:34,769
some floor out work on on systems like

416
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:37,558
this from years ago I've had slides of

417
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:39,839
geranium cuttings where it appeared that

418
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:43,109
they were rooted more heavily after

419
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:46,619
floral treatment on a stock plant or in

420
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:49,859
a plug tray and my reasoning back then

421
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:52,349
was where we're encouraging vegetative

422
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:54,389
growth and the root is a vegetative

423
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:57,439
organs so I want to take that little

424
00:21:54,390 --> 00:22:00,720
concept and see if it will translate and

425
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:04,440
and produce a uniform radish with a

426
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,900
smaller top now this is dangerous before

427
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,960
lunch but your conference organizers

428
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,850
asked me to put a little economics into

429
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,940
this presentation so I'm going to go

430
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:18,219
through about five minutes and give you

431
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,590
might might take which is a bit

432
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,509
untraditional on how we look at some of

433
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:25,449
our production costs but just bear with

434
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:27,640
me for it for a few slides this is on

435
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,528
the handout for those of you that might

436
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,580
want to take these tables home with you

437
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:36,278
first we want to handle a discussion of

438
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:40,329
overhead costs and the left-hand column

439
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:43,269
is a traditional dollars per square foot

440
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:46,869
per week as a means of describing

441
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:49,899
overhead costs the column I added next

442
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:53,259
to it is multiplying that per square

443
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:55,418
foot per week out by 52 weeks just to

444
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:59,579
get an idea just to get wrap our arms

445
00:22:55,419 --> 00:23:02,380
around how much is it costing for us to

446
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:06,970
remember the title of this presentation

447
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:09,850
is from flowers to food so my premise is

448
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,788
that many of us in the audience are

449
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:15,308
currently growing ornamental crops some

450
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:17,919
of us might not be satisfied with the

451
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:19,839
money we're making on flowers and we

452
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,049
might be looking at a corner of a

453
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:26,349
greenhouse a Bay of a range a section of

454
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:29,440
the operation to convert from flowers to

455
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:31,469
food so I thought it would be good to to

456
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,139
go through some traditional cost

457
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:38,319
analysis in the end we're going to be

458
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:40,329
faced with saying okay I can make more

459
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,428
per square foot growing flowers so

460
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:44,319
that's what I'll grow or I can make more

461
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:46,179
per square foot growing vegetables

462
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:50,548
that's what I'm going to do in those

463
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:54,059
square feet so the following columns are

464
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:57,940
taking square foot per week and

465
00:23:54,058 --> 00:24:01,778
converting it to a 10-20 tray so with 10

466
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,000
20 tray is 1.6 square feet and that's

467
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:06,849
what I'm going to do in these columns

468
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,880
then we're going to look at various crop

469
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:14,079
cycles just to fill things in a bit so

470
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:17,230
as an example a very fairly common

471
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:21,548
square foot per week overhead cost is 25

472
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:25,389
cents and if we look at 25 cents in a

473
00:24:21,548 --> 00:24:27,450
10-20 tray for a three-week crop cycle

474
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:29,729
it would be a dollar twenty four

475
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:33,630
are your overhead costs are we okay

476
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:36,798
there if we go to four weeks six weeks

477
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:39,899
eight weeks now what do these cycles

478
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:42,569
matchup with four vegetable crops this

479
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:44,969
would be the baby greens radish four

480
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:47,278
weeks turnip more like six weeks carrots

481
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,558
eight weeks all right so just for us to

482
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:53,940
wrap our arms around it i'm not asking

483
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:58,589
you to memorize or you know just just

484
00:24:53,940 --> 00:25:00,600
for a introductory conversation so i'm

485
00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:03,898
going to concentrate on the column for

486
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:06,480
radish just for simplicity today and

487
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:08,489
we'll come back to that in a moment so

488
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,440
you've got that table you can do

489
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:16,079
whatever you want with it variable cost

490
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:18,750
per tray 72 tray 128 288 again looking

491
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:22,349
at this radish example that I'm I'm

492
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:24,509
running through catalog tray prices very

493
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:27,928
similar for these three different trays

494
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:30,629
I'm assuming we can use a tray for four

495
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:33,360
crops with some sanitizing in between

496
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:37,169
crops so that brings that variable cost

497
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:40,918
down into the 40-cent range then we look

498
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:45,179
at the growing medium which i assume is

499
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:48,028
fairly similar because the 72 cell is a

500
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:49,980
larger cell but fewer cells right we

501
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:52,769
start adding cells but the cell size

502
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:56,819
decreases so I kind of comes out in the

503
00:25:52,769 --> 00:26:00,899
wash and you follow that argument

504
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:04,408
through the tray in the media 75 80

505
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:06,808
cents or tray and then the one that does

506
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:09,510
change is the as variable cost is the

507
00:26:06,808 --> 00:26:14,129
cost of the radish seeds so when we go

508
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:15,720
from 72 seeds up to 288 seeds then we've

509
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,419
got more money that we're putting into

510
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,700
that tray so add all those things up

511
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:23,549
folks and we're looking at somewhere

512
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:26,130
under over a dollar right another word

513
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:30,960
round number is this is very chunky big

514
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:36,360
chunk cost analysis now this this one

515
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,519
this part I wanted well many of us as

516
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,740
small growers are guilty of not

517
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,650
factoring into our

518
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,319
now sees our salaries many small

519
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:48,210
operations wait till the end of the

520
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,399
season and whatever's left in their

521
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,549
pocket ends up being his or her salary

522
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,890
as the small business owner so I want to

523
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:57,750
kind of play on that off of that a bit

524
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:04,440
and I'm going to approach this

525
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:06,599
differently so I'm going to to say how

526
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,500
much of the greenhouse range am i

527
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:14,058
considering shifting over to food crops

528
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:17,099
and once I decide how much room I have

529
00:27:14,058 --> 00:27:19,769
how much money do I want left in my

530
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:21,569
pocket at the end of the year all right

531
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:24,929
so if I'm balancing whether your

532
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:28,109
geraniums or radishes for me to change

533
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:31,140
from geraniums to radishes it's got to

534
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:34,289
put more money in my pocket so the way

535
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:38,070
I'm going through this this little table

536
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:40,740
is for instance if i'm going to put

537
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:43,829
10,000 square feet or a quarter of an

538
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,079
acre into radish production and pleased

539
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:51,149
with me I'm saying radishes but I'm

540
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:54,808
meaning anything edible okay if I want

541
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:59,460
to make 25 thousand dollars off of that

542
00:27:54,808 --> 00:28:01,799
10,000 square feet my overhead cost is

543
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,308
going to go up by a nickel a square foot

544
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:07,619
for a week does that make sense in other

545
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:10,259
words I'm factoring in my salary what do

546
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:12,449
I want my salary to be to justify going

547
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:15,750
into the vegetable crops if I want to

548
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:18,029
make $50,000 naturally it's going to

549
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,579
contribute more to the overhead costs

550
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:23,700
and then if I fill things in a little

551
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:26,879
bit the more space I want to put into

552
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:30,360
vegetable crops the lower that overhead

553
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:33,750
cost becomes if I want to make a lot of

554
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:36,089
money I'm probably going to want to put

555
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:40,558
a lot of space into production all right

556
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:42,980
enough back to this slide let's now zero

557
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:46,289
in on and finish this little thread

558
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:51,210
talking about radishes starting with

559
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:53,490
that common 25-cent overhead now if on

560
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,808
the previous slide i said i want to make

561
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:57,269
10,000 doll

562
00:28:54,808 --> 00:29:00,298
five thousand dollars 10,000 square feet

563
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:02,339
it contributes a nickel that nickel of

564
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:05,158
overhead per square foot per week will

565
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:07,499
translate into thirty cents per tray

566
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,269
right and i know this dangerous right

567
00:29:07,499 --> 00:29:13,499
before lunch going going through this

568
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:16,048
i'm glad the lights are up shift gears

569
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:18,538
now I went into the grocery store this

570
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:22,138
this well I took a morning this was fun

571
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:26,700
this was good research i went to walmart

572
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:36,388
i never go to walmart I Walmart is the

573
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:42,028
evil empire for me that's yeah everybody

574
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:47,908
hear that all right no spell check on

575
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:50,159
this guy so Walmart my local regional

576
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:54,179
store is called market basket and then I

577
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:56,840
went in whole foods so as expected Whole

578
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:59,820
Foods was the highest bunch of radishes

579
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:03,168
two dollars for the bunch there were

580
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:05,849
only nine radishes but it was organic

581
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:08,100
although the walmart ninety-four cents

582
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:12,269
the cheapest there were 12 radishes in

583
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:15,028
the bunch at my local chain this was the

584
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:18,210
bag of radishes without the greens that

585
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:21,269
you're familiar with 23 in there say two

586
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,720
dozen and they also had the live bunch

587
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:27,089
with greens 99 cents blah blah blah

588
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,069
alright so they need not really

589
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:31,648
interesting to you but you know I

590
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:34,829
weighed the fresh way cleaner pops off

591
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:38,579
weight / radish all that stuff but but

592
00:30:34,829 --> 00:30:41,509
the point that i want to bring out here

593
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:45,269
is is this range of retail costs and

594
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:47,999
from this range i chose a dollar forty

595
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:52,528
nine as the retail price that i'm going

596
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:54,329
to use in the analysis next step i'm

597
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:56,819
assuming that we have eighty-five

598
00:30:54,329 --> 00:31:00,599
percent yield in these various plug

599
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:03,118
trays so at a 72 tray eighty-five

600
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:07,678
percent yield will give us five bunches

601
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:08,619
of a dozen each if we're selling at a

602
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,680
dollar forty nine

603
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:15,009
the revenue 760 blah blah blah okay this

604
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:18,100
slide kind of summarizes it the overhead

605
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:21,579
costs that I was zeroing in on range

606
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:25,869
from a dollar 62 220 for variable cost

607
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:29,529
of the total production cost to 48 23 37

608
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:34,089
and again this is this big chunky cost

609
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:37,299
analysis the potential revenue 762 10 13

610
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:39,399
from the previous slide so so it is more

611
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:41,470
a proof of concept folks does it even

612
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,750
make sense to do this we know we can

613
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:47,289
grow them but is he going to make money

614
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:49,630
for us to to shift and this this first

615
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:53,829
time through with these numbers the

616
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:56,260
revenue is higher than the cost by

617
00:31:53,829 --> 00:32:00,369
enough that I want to keep pushing a

618
00:31:56,259 --> 00:32:03,490
pencil right so so i think my first year

619
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:06,639
in this project was proof of concept in

620
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,769
terms of the production of the crop once

621
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,170
we determine that it's only our

622
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:14,170
imagination we can grow anything we want

623
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:17,500
in a hydroponic environment then we

624
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:21,130
pressed on the economics a little bit in

625
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:23,589
the numbers at least right now are there

626
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:26,530
so so i think that we're going to be in

627
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:29,019
in good shape we munch mention local

628
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:30,428
adult I mean a young adults asking for

629
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:33,369
locally grown food they want to eat

630
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:35,320
what's in season this is key so far this

631
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:38,678
generation is willing to pay a premium

632
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:41,409
and I want to keep them away from

633
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:46,059
walmart and not poison them with this

634
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:48,220
cheap is best they're saying that my

635
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:50,879
earlier question would we be healthier

636
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:55,269
eating less but higher quality food

637
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,520
they're saying yes yes we want that here

638
00:32:55,269 --> 00:33:00,730
is that Boulder farmers market showing

639
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:03,579
the diversity and tomatoes this slide

640
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:06,190
really intrigued me because the cut

641
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:09,279
flowers in the lower right are showing

642
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:12,279
us this diversified horticulture where

643
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:16,420
we've got flora culture in with the food

644
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:19,299
production and the what struck me is the

645
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,880
interaction the intimacy of the farmer

646
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:24,069
to consumer relationship

647
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,250
and that's something that we don't have

648
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:30,839
in a supermarket or grocery store any of

649
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:34,359
us in garden centering we've always held

650
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:38,470
hung our hats on quality and service the

651
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:41,859
service part being that that intimacy

652
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:45,519
with our with our customer Alan kudos

653
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:48,639
for the app and bringing more education

654
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,609
to this whole table so that we can all

655
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,970
do a better job as with flowers folks

656
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:58,589
anchor in specialty items particularly

657
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:01,029
local populations ethnic preferences

658
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:04,539
breeding is going to bring all kinds of

659
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:07,960
opportunities when bright lights Swiss

660
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:10,809
chard was released years ago it blurred

661
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:14,440
the line between the flower garden and

662
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:17,969
the vegetable garden we've talked today

663
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,918
about the deck becoming the garden and

664
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:24,579
it's going to be blurred lines between

665
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:27,940
food crops and ornamentals we have

666
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:30,610
carrots shaped like radish beats shaped

667
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,490
like carrots it's like whatever we ask

668
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:36,610
plant breeders to give us they will and

669
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:41,939
I find that very exciting here is par

670
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:46,179
koi in in an ebb and flood environment

671
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:48,909
the deep nursery tray at harvest this

672
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:51,250
slide if in particular illustrates the

673
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:54,760
cultivar selection part of this process

674
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:57,960
so in a in a high density planting we

675
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:02,140
want to go more for the smaller compact

676
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:05,199
miniature cultivars so that we can avoid

677
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:08,589
the diseases and avoid the missteps in

678
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:10,960
production we can also force these into

679
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:13,510
a this a 50 sell trade grown more as a

680
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,559
baby green and you've seen that product

681
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:20,650
in the grocery store this is a pristine

682
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:23,320
glacial lake in Colorado unfortunately I

683
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:26,139
use it to to make a couple of comments

684
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,269
about fresh water and I think in our

685
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:30,369
lifetimes we're going to see that Wars

686
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:33,119
will not be fought over a few fossil

687
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:35,599
fuels Wars will be fought over water I

688
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,699
think we're already witnessing

689
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,579
this in the state of California where

690
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:43,309
the battle is between municipalities and

691
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:45,440
agriculture and if i were to put my

692
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:48,829
money on who's going to win i think it's

693
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,200
going to be municipalities so we need to

694
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:55,880
figure this out and we need to do it

695
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:59,089
quickly i think i'm going to skip

696
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,210
through final question can we return all

697
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:05,150
of our agriculture to the local level my

698
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:07,369
opinion no we can't we can't completely

699
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:09,440
displace industrialized agriculture

700
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:12,230
there's I don't think there's enough

701
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,480
room to do all of this but I do see a

702
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:17,269
significant portion of agriculture being

703
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,670
returned to its local roots and with

704
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:22,429
this field of celery that I stood at in

705
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,680
Southern California I brought that

706
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:28,250
feeling home and did some work with

707
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:34,730
celery this past season looking at in

708
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:37,400
1801 sell a 37 and a 72 and what was

709
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:41,360
really cool about this 80 days after

710
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:44,210
plant these three planets look very

711
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,760
similar in that hydroponic environment

712
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:49,429
where you can you can see where we don't

713
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,800
need all that growing medium anymore if

714
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:56,739
we are delivering the nutrients in that

715
00:36:51,800 --> 00:37:01,550
irrigation stream anymore more frequent

716
00:36:56,739 --> 00:37:03,409
cycling and then that harvest brought

717
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:06,370
those home on the under breadboard and

718
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:11,059
again the imagination squinting our eyes

719
00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:15,049
can we can we adapt and not have to have

720
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:16,489
a huge stock or plant of celery that

721
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:20,210
we're currently buying in the

722
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:23,029
supermarket can we buy smaller stocks of

723
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:25,880
celery that will allow me to grow it in

724
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:29,769
a shorter crop cycle so that I can make

725
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:34,690
a living growing celery for the local

726
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:38,679
market I'll close with this in my

727
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:41,470
experience if I talk carrots and celery

728
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:45,769
when I'm buying them in my local grocery

729
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:49,639
store I've learned the hard way less

730
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:54,528
than half the time when I come home that

731
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:56,868
celery is tender and sweet less than

732
00:37:54,528 --> 00:38:01,579
half the time the other times it's

733
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:05,028
bitter rubbery same for carrots sweet

734
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:07,910
tender week we can do all that we can

735
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:10,190
control all of that in the systems that

736
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:12,469
we're discussing today so I think the

737
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:15,380
quality part of it and if if our

738
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:17,838
youngsters continue to say i'll give you

739
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:20,210
an extra nickel for that so that i can

740
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,460
make a living doing it then I think

741
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:24,409
everything becomes more fair everything

742
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,869
is going to work out I think that's

743
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:29,298
going to be it I ended with tomato so

744
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:35,510
many of us talked to made us today thank

745
00:38:29,298 --> 00:38:37,548
you very much for the invitation this

746
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:42,430
has been a production of Cornell

747
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:42,429
