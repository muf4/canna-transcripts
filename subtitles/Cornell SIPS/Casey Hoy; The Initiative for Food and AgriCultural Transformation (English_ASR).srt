1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,859
well first of all thanks to Anu and

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,480
Cathy and and many others for the

5
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:15,759
invitation the opportunity to come here

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,189
it's pretty special visit for me I don't

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,259
get back here often enough both of my

8
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:22,509
degrees are from Cornell so I'm here

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,759
visiting very special people and very

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,340
special places some of them are in the

11
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:29,230
audience my sister is one of the staff

12
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:31,559
members here at Cornell University who

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:35,230
continues to make it a great institution

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,869
my wife the maid of honor at our wedding

15
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:40,328
I think this is the first seminar my

16
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:43,448
wife has ever seen me gift we got

17
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:45,518
married at the ad Dixon White House just

18
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:48,339
down the road so it's an incredibly

19
00:00:45,518 --> 00:00:52,600
romantic time - it's great to be here I

20
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:54,370
really appreciate it and and I do have

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,780
two full-time jobs there at the bottom

22
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:57,338
of the screen so one is the faculty

23
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,679
director for in fact and the other is

24
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:01,899
the Kellogg chair and I'm going to tell

25
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,429
you a little bit about Agrico systems

26
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:04,930
management program first and how we

27
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:07,090
think about agro-ecosystem

28
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,400
and agro-ecosystem health because that

29
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,770
had a lot to do with the way we shaped

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,390
our proposal for what became and is

31
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:16,209
becoming the initiative for food and

32
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:19,180
agricultural transformation so this is

33
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:22,809
me a few years ago when I was here this

34
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:25,420
is how I got my start as a scout for the

35
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,280
New York IPM programs scouting cabbage

36
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,379
and vegetables across western New York

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,230
first for the IPM programs and then as a

38
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:34,089
private consultant and I would count

39
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,820
bugs and help farmers try to figure out

40
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,070
what to do about these insect pests and

41
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:40,299
I kept asking you know what isn't there

42
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:41,859
a better way that we could be going

43
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:43,209
about this whole thing and if you start

44
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:44,739
asking those kind of questions pretty

45
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:47,229
soon you're in a career in research and

46
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:49,390
that's what happened and so I continued

47
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,579
to work on some of these pests in the

48
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,170
earlier part of my career at Ohio State

49
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:54,039
so this is one of them this is the

50
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,829
diamondback moth

51
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,870
that's a pupa it's in a broccoli floret

52
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:00,519
and they're a big problem in broccoli

53
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,969
florets because you can't wash him out

54
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:05,349
of there

55
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:07,239
back in the 80s and 90s at least most of

56
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:07,869
your frozen broccoli was coming from

57
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,840
Central

58
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:13,870
Mexico the Baguio region and it led to

59
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,520
work with researchers down there where

60
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,710
they were setting out pheromone traps

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,590
for these mods and checking them three

62
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,939
times a week every single week from 1987

63
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,420
to 2005

64
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:27,759
so as entomologist we don't get datasets

65
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:29,859
like this very often and this led to

66
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,929
some questions about what is going on in

67
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,420
this system that would lead to this kind

68
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,510
of pattern what we showed is three kind

69
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:40,209
of distinct periods here where the

70
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:41,620
pattern was changing so one where there

71
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,210
was this kind of regular cyclical

72
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,710
pattern this is using time series

73
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,680
analysis and then a period where the

74
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,360
populations increased and the

75
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,400
fluctuations got really wild and then a

76
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,560
period where they drop down again but

77
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,080
the same pattern of how increases

78
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,539
follows decreases has been maintained

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,160
since this this drop-off and this had a

80
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:02,590
little bit more to do with weather than

81
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,780
anything else well what we were finding

82
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,090
is in looking at what was going on in

83
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,800
this agro-ecosystem that would it best

84
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,349
explain what was going on with this

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,880
particular pest it was really a lot

86
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:15,159
about the amount of broccoli that they

87
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,400
were growing so they went from 8,000

88
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,530
hectares to 40,000 hectares of broccoli

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,840
during this period that's a heck of a

90
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,300
lot of broccoli and what it does is

91
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,849
create an enormous carrying capacity for

92
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,469
pests like this but the pest wasn't the

93
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:31,989
only issue they were starting to have

94
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:34,659
problems with groundwater with

95
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:37,300
salinization of the soil with markets

96
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:39,849
with labor availability the extent that

97
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,650
the processing company down there that

98
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:43,239
were part of this industry we're already

99
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,969
looking at other parts of the world to

100
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,489
move and get out of this region of

101
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:51,009
central Mexico so if you keep focusing

102
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:53,379
on just one problem then usually you

103
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:55,899
miss what's going on in the system we

104
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:57,819
have a grand tradition in entomology of

105
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,980
solving one problem and creating three

106
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:02,349
more in the process and that's great for

107
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:04,179
job security but after a while it starts

108
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:05,919
to feel like a game of whack-a-mole you

109
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,000
just keep going from one problem to the

110
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:13,399
next and fixing that and then

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,020
to the next one we like to step back and

112
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,840
take a look at the system instead of

113
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,189
looking at one problem after the next

114
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,719
like I say we have a tradition in

115
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:22,069
entomology of this we also have a

116
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,390
tradition of this in the land grant

117
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:28,040
system in general and in our food policy

118
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,500
in the United States so that's kind of

119
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,510
wrapped up in this Byzantine proverb but

120
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,730
you notice who brings you this proverb

121
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:37,039
but he who has bread has many problems

122
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,860
he who has no bread has only one problem

123
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,780
and that's quite true and we we were

124
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,370
experiencing that right after the Great

125
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:45,859
Depression so I was just reading the

126
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,110
other night something like 70% of the

127
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,770
young men who joined the Civilian

128
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,650
Conservation Corps were malnourished and

129
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:55,969
poorly clothed alike when World War two

130
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:57,829
came along there were a lot of people

131
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,210
that were just not fit to serve in the

132
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:01,759
military because they were malnourished

133
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:04,939
now you start having trouble raising an

134
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,089
army and governments get attentive to

135
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:10,160
that very quickly so this was kind of

136
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:14,418
the resolve coming out of that period in

137
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,280
our history where there was a decision

138
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:17,569
across government level we are not going

139
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,159
through those kind of shortages again

140
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:22,759
we're going to make sure that there's

141
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,939
enough and in the process we've created

142
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,800
a few other issues so this is the bind

143
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:30,529
that we tend to put farmers in these

144
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,530
days this whole kind of cartoon version

145
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:35,569
of it but the amount that we all spend

146
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:38,299
on food that the farmer gets to keep

147
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:40,370
over the years keeps shrinking because

148
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,410
our food prices are not going way up but

149
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,329
all the costs of what farmers have to

150
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,790
deal with in order to be really

151
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:48,829
productive keep going up the cost of

152
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,840
inputs the value added beyond the farm

153
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:52,459
gate so there's a couple ways out of

154
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:54,500
this squeeze you can get really good at

155
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:56,509
operating in the middle of it and what

156
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,660
people tend to do there is get

157
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:01,969
specialized expand get bigger get really

158
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,800
good at using technology so that you can

159
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,050
produce a whole lot because you're not

160
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,850
making much on each unit the other

161
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,160
approach would be to try to recapture

162
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,400
some of the cost of these inputs or some

163
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,030
of the value that's added beyond the

164
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:18,879
either way it's a very difficult task to

165
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:20,739
be a farmer these days so in the agro

166
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,930
ecosystems management program this is a

167
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,788
group of faculty at Ohio State

168
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,949
University who were willing to step back

169
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:30,339
and work with partners outside of the

170
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:33,250
university on looking for balance and

171
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:35,318
that's balance between environmental and

172
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,360
the economic and social dimensions of

173
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,460
Agriculture and considering it as a

174
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,669
system it's not just farms it's also

175
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:45,129
neighboring communities we had a

176
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:47,740
tradition very early on of working with

177
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:49,629
people outside the university because we

178
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,610
found if this was a group of academics

179
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:53,529
talking about big systems kind of stuff

180
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,870
it would get very ethereal very quickly

181
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:57,250
and so we were interested in making sure

182
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,019
this was grounded in something that

183
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,970
would actually help and one of the

184
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,799
things that we were asked for very early

185
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,900
on was we're talking about this very

186
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,030
complex system it's an environment its

187
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:09,279
economy its social out of you how do you

188
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:11,019
get your arms around this can you give

189
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,799
us a way of understanding how we're

190
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:17,228
doing as an agricultural ecosystem so we

191
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,478
set out to construct an index of agro

192
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:21,788
ecosystem health and if you're gonna do

193
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:23,889
that you have to define health first so

194
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:25,899
we chose this definition that was

195
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,210
proposed quite a while ago by Gordon

196
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:30,098
Conway he was president of Rockefeller

197
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:32,079
Foundation at the time he described

198
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:36,490
agro-ecosystem health in terms of these

199
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,930
four properties and we further fleshed

200
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,759
out what we mean by each of those

201
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,709
properties but if you look at those you

202
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,598
could probably see already that they're

203
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:45,399
not necessarily things that are moving

204
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,829
in lockstep there's trade-offs within

205
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:51,429
that list so it's challenging anyway to

206
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:54,098
talk about agro-ecosystem health in

207
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:58,990
terms of those four properties we came

208
00:07:54,098 --> 00:08:02,348
up with six key variables that to us

209
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:04,810
describe the processes that best led to

210
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:07,629
a definition of those properties over

211
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,598
time and those key variables were kind

212
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:13,680
of in these six broad character Gauri's

213
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:15,389
soils and soil health topography

214
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,370
biodiversity and

215
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:22,919
and the next three are social economic

216
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,959
properties and the idea behind the index

217
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,000
that we came up with is that you have a

218
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,219
pattern on a landscape and you have

219
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,670
things flowing across the landscape some

220
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,410
of its good money going to farmers

221
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,690
beneficial organisms some of it's bad so

222
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,579
pests and diseases flowing between farm

223
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,610
fields some of it just flowing but it's

224
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,740
the pattern of sources and sinks on the

225
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:47,250
landscape that leads to those flows and

226
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,139
it's the flows that define the processes

227
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,659
that lead to those properties of

228
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:54,840
productivity and sustainability

229
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:57,419
stability and equitability over time so

230
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,920
long story short we combine those six

231
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:01,049
variables and actually there were quite

232
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:03,689
a few indicators that led to those six

233
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:06,479
variables using analytical hierarchy

234
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:09,030
process combine that into an index of

235
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,210
agro-ecosystem health that the men and

236
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:14,519
get an idea of how you were doing and

237
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:17,040
compare one place to another and even

238
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,449
more importantly where a Grieco system

239
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,549
health was a bit lower you can drill

240
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,350
down and figure out why so what are the

241
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:25,139
underlying variables that you could work

242
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,330
on to improve the health of that part of

243
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:31,049
the agro-ecosystem the most quickly and

244
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,879
that's a little bit background on how we

245
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:34,289
think about agro ecosystems and

246
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,019
agro-ecosystem health it's this

247
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:40,709
combination of social and biophysical

248
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:43,590
dimension find that lead to this pattern

249
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,360
on the landscape healthy agro ecosystems

250
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,519
are becoming very important there are

251
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,590
some predictions that suggest that

252
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,529
agriculture is going to get harder to do

253
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,389
over time so these are the climate

254
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:56,939
change predictions for our part of the

255
00:09:54,389 --> 00:10:00,899
world that's the Upper Midwest I live

256
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:04,380
right about there in Worcester Ohio and

257
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:07,649
in this map on the Left darker blue

258
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:10,019
means more predicted heavy rainfall

259
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,569
events so we're in a part where we're

260
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,360
expecting more heavy rainfall events

261
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:18,600
this one on the right is prediction for

262
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,370
increase in consecutive dry days and

263
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,259
once again we're there where it's a

264
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,539
little bit darker so we're expecting

265
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:25,809
more heavy rainfall events and more

266
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:28,299
consecutive dry

267
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:32,649
is wetter when it's wet drier when it's

268
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:34,479
dry and no predictability so far about

269
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:36,039
what the pattern is are we talking about

270
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,019
three years of drought and then three

271
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:40,179
years of rain or one month the drought

272
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:41,949
one month or rain and until you can

273
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:44,049
figure that out you really don't have a

274
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,300
good way of adapting to that or knowing

275
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:50,019
what you have to do to adapt to that new

276
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:52,479
pattern so for me the element that best

277
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:55,899
describes these predictions of climate

278
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,240
change is in this row in the periodic

279
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:00,159
table of elements that you usually don't

280
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,720
spend a much time on in chemistry class

281
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:06,490
and there's a gap in the middle of them

282
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:12,009
they all start with you you uh the

283
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:13,419
element of surprise and I think that

284
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:15,069
describes pretty well what we're up

285
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:16,709
against with climate change just a lot

286
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,570
of surprises and a lot of them not

287
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:23,019
necessarily real pleasant surprises so

288
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,580
how you adapt agriculture I'm not sure

289
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:26,470
how many of you have seen this diagram

290
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,720
this is from the resilience Alliance and

291
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,580
it's kind of an early version of the the

292
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,759
figures that they use to describe how

293
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:36,430
systems change over time and you

294
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,490
probably recognize this contribu from R

295
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:42,159
to K which is kind of the classic

296
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:45,430
disturb to more conserve kind of climax

297
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,259
vegetation so the eco systems and social

298
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:51,459
systems tend to go back and forth

299
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:53,259
between these two poles in sustainable

300
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,660
agriculture a lot of what we do is when

301
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:58,088
we plow a field we're pushing it back

302
00:11:55,659 --> 00:12:00,399
towards this exploitation area because

303
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:01,960
we want to exploit it for food and of

304
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,819
course we create an environment that

305
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,650
pests and diseases and the light can

306
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,240
exploit very well so a lot of

307
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:08,559
sustainable agriculture is trying to

308
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,959
strike that balance and getting the

309
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,389
system to act more like these conserve

310
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:16,208
systems where we get we need out of it

311
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:18,159
but it's not so exploitable by other

312
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:21,819
organisms so that you have these wild

313
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,799
outbreaks of diseases and that's alright

314
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,170
but what happens occasionally is the

315
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,729
environment changes to the point where

316
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:30,009
everything that was conserved and

317
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,528
working real well here just doesn't work

318
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:33,468
anymore

319
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:37,269
and it all gets released and then in

320
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:38,689
that release is that working out there

321
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:40,908
there it is

322
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:42,769
yeah so in that release there's a chance

323
00:12:40,908 --> 00:12:45,499
for all of that that have been conserved

324
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:47,509
up here to get reorganized and then go

325
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:49,249
back into this cycle again and in that

326
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:52,129
reorganization you can actually lose

327
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:53,839
some capacity so they desert of vacation

328
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:56,509
or something like that loss of a seed

329
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,059
bank so you no longer have some of that

330
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:01,308
capacity to reorganize so when we talk

331
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:03,978
about resilience we're talking about

332
00:13:01,308 --> 00:13:04,968
what happens when there's a big change

333
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:06,649
in the environment well these

334
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:08,719
predictions of climate change would be a

335
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:12,288
big change in the environment in which

336
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:14,749
we're currently producing food so that

337
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:16,489
that list of challenges is one that Fred

338
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:18,619
Kirschenmann throws at us all the time

339
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:20,509
he's part of this network of catalog

340
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:22,219
chairs and other scholars you want to

341
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:23,869
talk sustainable agriculture tell me how

342
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,669
you're going to farm with higher

343
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:28,219
temperatures more extreme weather half

344
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:30,708
the water and oil at $300 a barrel and

345
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:32,719
that would be very difficult to do

346
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:35,408
agriculture the way we do it now under

347
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:37,249
those conditions so that's an

348
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:39,828
environmental change that will cause a

349
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:42,918
big shift part of the definition of

350
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:44,598
resilience is about how much change the

351
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:46,308
system can go through and still bounce

352
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:49,220
back to where it was so there's this

353
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:52,068
kind of stability part of the definition

354
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,418
can they take a shock and go back what's

355
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:55,938
more important is when the environment

356
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:57,918
really changes how can the system adapt

357
00:13:55,938 --> 00:13:59,688
and get through that what what they call

358
00:13:57,918 --> 00:14:02,720
in the resilience alliance the back loop

359
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:04,969
of release and reorganization and adapt

360
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,129
and regain the functions that were

361
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,798
really concerned about like everybody

362
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:11,869
having enough to eat so the kind of

363
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:14,658
qualities of a system that make it

364
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:17,019
better able to go through that back loop

365
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:19,818
of release and reorganization or

366
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:22,639
self-organization the capacity to learn

367
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:24,889
and adapt which typically requires some

368
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,120
diversity that you can then select from

369
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:31,259
in that adaptation

370
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,089
and what kind of qualities would we look

371
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:34,740
for in agro ecosystems then well there's

372
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:37,709
diversity in terms of what we produce

373
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,600
and if you go to markets in other part

374
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:41,458
of the world you'll tend to find a whole

375
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,769
lot more things that people are eating

376
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,088
than what you'd find at Wegmans there

377
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:47,159
were probably a whole lot of things that

378
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,709
people were eating in this area that

379
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,328
we're not consuming anymore that people

380
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,008
were eating before European settlers

381
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:54,269
arrived so there's a whole lot of things

382
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:56,370
out there that we don't necessarily

383
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,899
consume that we could we could be

384
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,328
thinking about that you can be thinking

385
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:03,589
about the diversity within the things

386
00:15:00,328 --> 00:15:05,549
that we do eat so there's the phenotypic

387
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:08,579
genotypic and gene by environment

388
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:13,078
interaction kind of diversity that you

389
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:14,609
have within crops of given crop and then

390
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,489
there's diversity in terms of who's

391
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,709
doing agriculture right now it's down to

392
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,959
about 1% of our population that are on

393
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:23,909
big farms but a lot of people getting

394
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,539
interested in getting reengaged with

395
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:28,948
agriculture so that would give you some

396
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:31,159
diversity once again and if you think

397
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:33,208
about it those qualities especially with

398
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:35,999
self-organization and innovation as some

399
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:37,859
of the things that link these dimensions

400
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:39,959
of agro-ecosystem health it's very

401
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,079
consistent this idea of agro-ecosystem

402
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:45,058
health leading to resilience so there's

403
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:48,438
some ideas about that published in a

404
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:51,808
paper in Jess if you're interested in in

405
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:53,759
those kind of questions so this is kind

406
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:55,230
of given us a lot of guidance on the

407
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,928
kind of work that we're doing in the

408
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,149
agro ecosystems management program this

409
00:15:57,928 --> 00:16:02,220
is an example of a small and mid-sized

410
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:04,980
farms grant that we have is a small farm

411
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,559
just to the west of Worcester that was

412
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,558
donated to a RDC we have a grant to look

413
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:12,469
at the very early stages of diversifying

414
00:16:10,558 --> 00:16:15,120
a farm that's been in corn and soybeans

415
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,920
not big enough to really make a living

416
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,928
doing corn and soybeans so if you're not

417
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:20,719
going to do that and do economy of scale

418
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:22,639
then what are you going to do

419
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,370
and economists are calling this economy

420
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,460
of scope the idea that you diversify and

421
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,649
then use the diversification as a way of

422
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,120
recapturing some of those input costs

423
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:34,039
that you would otherwise be spending if

424
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,929
you were going the other route into

425
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:38,629
economies of scale so we've got oil seed

426
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:40,699
crops forage vegetables pasture poultry

427
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:42,620
all kinds of things going on there and

428
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,080
what we're looking at in this project is

429
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,330
how quickly are the new benefits in

430
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,710
terms of soil quality access to markets

431
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,250
and things like that as well as new

432
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:54,560
costs cropping up this is a project that

433
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,480
we've had for some time if the idea of

434
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,759
this social networking site is

435
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,710
connecting entrepreneurs along supply

436
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:02,569
chains so that they're launching entire

437
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,880
supply chains instead of just one

438
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,279
business in the middle of a non-existent

439
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,530
local or regional supply chain which is

440
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,059
kind of tough to hang on while you're

441
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,309
doing battle with Walmart waiting for

442
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:14,599
everybody else to show up so the idea is

443
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,179
well let's get the planning going more

444
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,509
in cahoots and launch the entire chain

445
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,560
and it has features on there for

446
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:23,809
entrepreneurs to connect with each other

447
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:25,759
along supply chains collaborate on their

448
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,990
business plans there's a sneak peek at

449
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,319
the next version of it so we're just

450
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,420
about to launch this and this has

451
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,980
sections for both the bloggers who want

452
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,140
to share deep thoughts about food which

453
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,519
is great they could be investors at some

454
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,080
point but then you have the

455
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,879
entrepreneurs and they're the ones that

456
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:43,129
are really what the site is about is

457
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,440
helping them develop plans that lead to

458
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,330
entire supply chains as well as a

459
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,940
section that's for economic developers

460
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:51,829
so it becomes their tool that they can

461
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,960
use to support that entrepreneurship

462
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:55,960
which really is their job but

463
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,220
agriculture is a tough place for

464
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,720
economic developers to work as you're

465
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,430
talking about lots and lots of

466
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,980
businesses and they're spread out all

467
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,480
over the place so here's one example of

468
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,210
one of the supply chains that was

469
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,610
evolving as part of this project this is

470
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:15,170
a very large dairy farm up in Ashtabula

471
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:16,909
Ohio that little silvery thing down at

472
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:20,060
the bottom is not the swimming pool

473
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:22,130
that's called the lagoon it's not

474
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:25,909
something you want to get into

475
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:28,880
so this dairy farmer needed a way of

476
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:31,279
dealing with the stuff in the lagoon and

477
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,049
his choice he got involved with talking

478
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,149
about a bio digester with a company

479
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:38,150
called quasar and this is a bio digester

480
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:40,490
they have on our campus at O ard C and

481
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,798
that would give them a place to put the

482
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,440
cow manure that would generate heat and

483
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,329
methane so he's got a lot of cows he's

484
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,279
already got heat and methane he doesn't

485
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:50,599
care about those products he just wants

486
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,879
to get rid of the manure because he

487
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:55,099
needs that to get his sighting permit

488
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,020
but there was a small vegetable grower

489
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:59,178
down the road who wanted to say to green

490
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:01,038
house next to the bio digester used the

491
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,110
heat and methane to grow vegetables all

492
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,819
winter he already had a contract with

493
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:06,259
the local school system and they were

494
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:08,000
willing to collect their food waste and

495
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:09,679
send it back to the bio digester and you

496
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,599
need to combine food waste and manure

497
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,548
actually to make the bio digester work

498
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,189
really well so that's a good example

499
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:18,829
kind of classic industrial ecology where

500
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,659
that output from one business becomes

501
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:23,149
the input for the next business and it

502
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,830
all cycles very efficiently on a

503
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,230
landscape and those are the kinds of

504
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:29,599
flows that we had envisioned many years

505
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,950
ago as being the kind of flows that

506
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:35,178
would lead to healthy agro-ecosystem

507
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:40,009
full disclosure this never actually

508
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:41,900
happened the the negotiations broke down

509
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:45,529
between the dairy farmer and the bio

510
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:47,298
digester builder so it they never could

511
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:49,129
quite get it together to put all this in

512
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:51,079
place but it's a great idea it's waiting

513
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,880
out there so if any of you have a bio

514
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,839
digester and know any vegetable growers

515
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,480
it's still waiting to happen

516
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,339
so to really understand what we've got

517
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,890
on the Ohio landscape you have to go

518
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:03,079
back in time like well before we develop

519
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:06,049
the agro-ecosystem hip health index

520
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:08,808
about 1.8 million years that takes you

521
00:20:06,048 --> 00:20:11,240
to the end of the Pleistocene which is

522
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:13,668
the last time Ohio was extensively

523
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:18,470
glaciated so that dark area at the top

524
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:21,710
is the glaciated area of Ohio that River

525
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:25,579
the tazed River was where that mouse

526
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:28,308
just doesn't want to do it this here was

527
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:31,730
what paleo geologists say was the

528
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:33,200
drainage before that ice age came up

529
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,220
from the southern Appalachians arced

530
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,480
through Ohio and then down the

531
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,620
Mississippi

532
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,460
but the glaciers did is kind of

533
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:42,799
bulldozed all of this rich gray shal

534
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,809
glacial till into those deep river

535
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,759
valleys and created really productive

536
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:51,019
fertile soils and also rearranged the

537
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,000
drainage so it's now what you'd

538
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:56,210
recognize the Ohio River going down to

539
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,740
the Mississippi I have to sheepishly

540
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,690
admit I don't remember this from the

541
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,549
geology course that I took here but I

542
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,990
didn't think that was at the same time

543
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:06,079
that the Finger Lakes

544
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,309
and kind of glacial geology so show me

545
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:11,750
you've taken the course more recently

546
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:13,429
heaven okay but I so we took a walk in

547
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,380
robert riemann yesterday and I do

548
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,640
remember taking the walk and Robert

549
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,650
Riemann with the professor in that

550
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,450
course and you hearing all about this in

551
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,890
terms of gorges and I think you're like

552
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,569
so anyway this is what was happening

553
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:29,780
just to the west and what had led to is

554
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:32,210
a real opportunity for people in this

555
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:34,129
state so that's the Glacial divide just

556
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:37,309
keep your eye on the line between the

557
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:43,880
glaciated and unglaciated and that is

558
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:46,579
median household income in 2000 in 2000

559
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,130
yeah we do that one more time so keep

560
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:50,720
your eye on the line again so if there's

561
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,580
any question that our wealth is coming

562
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,539
from our soils that helps me get to ask

563
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:59,960
that question these are very fertile

564
00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:01,789
productive soils also leads to a state

565
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,980
with a lot of diversity so that's a

566
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:05,599
Gordon vegetation index map but I don't

567
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,370
expect you to read the legend but the

568
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,349
point is there's a lot of different

569
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:13,429
kinds of plant communities in Ohio we

570
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:14,839
straddle for EPA ecological zones so

571
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:18,820
there's a tremendous amount of diversity

572
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:22,159
so fast forward a few million years to

573
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:25,819
about 1800 and this is what European

574
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:28,700
settlers are finding so Columbus is

575
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:30,379
right there the Ohio rivers down here

576
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:34,190
this was kind of prairie and this was

577
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:36,290
all woods the early settlers figured the

578
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,779
Prairie was kind of useless because you

579
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:40,339
couldn't even grow trees there but what

580
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:42,470
they figured out very quickly is these

581
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:45,319
river valleys we're really good for

582
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,389
growing corn so this is the Scioto River

583
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:50,598
this little finger coming down

584
00:22:47,388 --> 00:22:52,189
here to the Ohio and they figured out

585
00:22:50,598 --> 00:22:55,249
real quickly you could grow a lot of

586
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:57,440
corn in those river bellies so it's 1804

587
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:59,719
1810 you got a lot of corn what are you

588
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,788
gonna do with it there's nobody around

589
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:03,979
it's the Ohio frontier there's maybe two

590
00:23:01,788 --> 00:23:06,440
military Gareth Garrison's along the

591
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:08,659
Ohio River where you could sell it what

592
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:13,159
are you gonna do with corn anybody got

593
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:15,469
an idea give it legs yeah feed it to

594
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:17,479
cows so a guy named William Renwick in

595
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:20,719
1813 figured out that you could make a

596
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:22,848
tidy profit by producing corn-fed beef

597
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:24,528
and sending it over the mountains and

598
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:26,838
selling the beef on the international

599
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:29,509
market out of Baltimore and we had a

600
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:33,200
1,500 head CAFO confined animal feeding

601
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:34,719
operation in Coshocton in 1850 in ohio

602
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,528
so what else can you do with corn I

603
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:41,599
think yes for a minute so there were

604
00:23:39,528 --> 00:23:43,848
stills all over the Ohio frontier not

605
00:23:41,598 --> 00:23:46,398
because it was perpetual Spring Break it

606
00:23:43,848 --> 00:23:48,468
was because that's something you could

607
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:50,268
do with corn dad value so you could turn

608
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:52,459
it into whiskey you put the whiskey on

609
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:54,558
flatboats and float those down the Ohio

610
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:56,389
River to New Orleans and sell it on the

611
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,519
international market and then you could

612
00:23:56,388 --> 00:24:01,098
also take the brewing grains and feed

613
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,778
that to animals pigs and alike so there

614
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:06,398
were two distilleries and about nine

615
00:24:02,778 --> 00:24:09,019
breweries in Cincinnati producing

616
00:24:06,398 --> 00:24:10,518
turning the corn into ethanol and then

617
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:11,959
taking all those bird grains and feeding

618
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:13,578
them to pigs which you could also chop

619
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:15,709
up and put in barrels with a lot of salt

620
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:17,778
and sell that on the international

621
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:20,179
market out of New Orleans

622
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:22,069
I love these quotes about what life was

623
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:25,579
like in Cincinnati back in those days it

624
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:27,739
was called porkopolis and that bottom

625
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:29,479
quote is perfect Cincinnati originated

626
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:31,249
perfected the system that packs 15

627
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:32,719
bushels of corn into a pig and packs the

628
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:33,979
pig into a barrel and sends them over

629
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:37,999
the mountain isn't over the ocean to

630
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:41,838
feed mankind all right so that's 18 20

631
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:45,108
and we fast forward to about now well

632
00:24:41,838 --> 00:24:47,229
first that's a statue of a flying pig

633
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:49,879
there are those statues all over

634
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:52,279
Cincinnati this is

635
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,440
College of Biological Sciences we can't

636
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:57,619
let that go without addressing it so

637
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,720
this is the Lord Brabazon of Tara the

638
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:02,299
First Lord Brabazon of Tara who

639
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,430
demonstrated in 1909 by strapping a

640
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:06,589
basket on to the wing of his biplane and

641
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,930
then putting a pig in the basket and

642
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:12,589
then taking off into the sky the pigs do

643
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:14,779
indeed fly this is back when the ruling

644
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:16,819
class not only approved of science they

645
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:19,569
actually got involved in it testing

646
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:21,649
hypotheses like this the BI tenders

647
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:23,000
bystanders tended to say that the pig

648
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,840
didn't seem to have a lot of choice but

649
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,630
the pig did fly so this is what you see

650
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:32,269
these days if you look at Ohio from

651
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,250
space so remember the Gordon vegetation

652
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:36,529
index map we can grow all kinds of stuff

653
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:39,859
we grow all of the things on this long

654
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:42,410
legend somewhere but you see five things

655
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:45,500
and you can see that line of where the

656
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:47,750
glaciers were again and all that stuff

657
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,910
on the lower right is grass and trees

658
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,309
and on the upper left it's corn and

659
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:55,850
we've added soybeans so that's what we

660
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:57,679
accomplished in about 200 years we've

661
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:59,869
added soybeans we're still growing a lot

662
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,990
of corn we still feed it to animals in

663
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:04,309
Capo's and we produced meat and we sell

664
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,880
that on the international market and we

665
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:09,200
produce ethanol for transportation fuel

666
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,730
there is one other thing that's changing

667
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,730
in this picture though all those gray

668
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,710
spots that's where people live so we're

669
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,839
not what we're not in the situation the

670
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,120
settlers we're faced with in the early

671
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,859
1800s there actually are some people

672
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,229
around that you could sell stuff to and

673
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:26,179
people are starting to figure that out

674
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,950
but if you go out why why does it look

675
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,620
like this then you know if you have all

676
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,539
these local markets right there and

677
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:34,399
you're still producing corn and soy

678
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:36,139
beans everywhere what's the deal here

679
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,720
and if you talk in the farm community

680
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,190
there's a lot of focus on we feed the

681
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,440
world this is what we have to do because

682
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,330
we feed the world and I have a lot of

683
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,360
respect and admiration for people that

684
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:49,129
are driven by that goal we want to feed

685
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,289
somebody we want to feed the world and

686
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:53,750
that's a great thing but the data isn't

687
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:56,839
necessarily lining up with that

688
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:58,180
statement so if you look worldwide it's

689
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:00,059
approximately one in nine people

690
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:03,390
chronically malnourished

691
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:05,669
with all the disease and a lack of human

692
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:08,700
potential or decrease in potential that

693
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:10,590
comes along with that it's not because

694
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,319
farmers aren't producing enough so if

695
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:15,119
you look at these are FAO statistics by

696
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,730
the way you look at per capita food

697
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:21,329
availability about twenty seven ninety

698
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:24,420
kilocalories per person per day so I

699
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:26,039
think its calories actually so what how

700
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,000
many calories does it take to sustain a

701
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,000
person for a day

702
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,439
2,500

703
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:33,440
two thousand

704
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:40,470
and who yeah how so if you're Michael

705
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:43,019
Phelps it's a lot more don't try to do

706
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,930
what he does but its bottom line is

707
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:47,400
that's more than what it takes to really

708
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:49,830
maintain each person in terms of caloric

709
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,240
requirements so it's not because there

710
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:52,799
isn't enough it's because obviously it's

711
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,779
not getting to people who need it and

712
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,849
another interesting statistic is that

713
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:58,379
people think that this all comes from

714
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:59,909
these really large farms because they're

715
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,730
really efficient they have really high

716
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:05,430
yields it turns out 70% of the supply is

717
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,930
still coming from small farms and even

718
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,240
though large farms have a lot of the

719
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,789
land area it's not the majority of the

720
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,420
food that's being produced so these are

721
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:18,119
kind of global figures the one a9 we own

722
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,550
it in Ohio so this is the most recent

723
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:23,969
census it just came out several weeks

724
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:25,919
ago we've now been joined by Maine and

725
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,299
Oregon as northern states with higher

726
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,450
than the national average food and

727
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:32,430
household food insecurity rates but the

728
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,650
census before that we were the only one

729
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:36,480
out of the south that had higher the

730
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,300
national average food insecurity rates

731
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,539
in Ohio so it's about 16% of households

732
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:45,149
that's one in six of our neighbors

733
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:46,950
experiencing low food security six point

734
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,720
six percent very low we'll get to that

735
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,890
in a minute but it goes way up for

736
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,190
households with children

737
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:57,170
single mothers people of color the same

738
00:28:53,190 --> 00:29:00,240
kind of categories that are affected by

739
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:03,120
kind of class issues and poverty so this

740
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,630
is not the picture of a system that's

741
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:10,589
sustainable or resilient this is what's

742
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:14,030
be that where those low and very low

743
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:17,159
food security figures come from so the

744
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:19,559
darker the middle shade of blue is low

745
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,500
food security its those top three

746
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:24,240
categories so worried kind of this all

747
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,089
the stress of not knowing where your

748
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,950
next meal is coming from plus a change

749
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:31,769
in the diet so don't feel like you can't

750
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,150
afford a balanced meal very low food

751
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:36,029
security you started getting into

752
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:37,980
actually going hungry but even for low

753
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:39,779
food security that's one in six of our

754
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:43,120
neighbors there's an impact on what

755
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:46,299
people are eating and it's not just

756
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:49,209
hunger and lack of food that's a food

757
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:51,819
system issue so that obesity type 2

758
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:54,400
diabetes diet related disease is a huge

759
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:56,769
food security issue we know that a lot

760
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:00,430
of what's marketed for children is not

761
00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:02,259
great nutritionally so that there's

762
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:05,380
actually more people that are

763
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:08,410
experienced obesity than chronic hunger

764
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:12,330
and malnutrition these days and that is

765
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:15,700
a food system issue the the current

766
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:17,139
statistics are that a lot of volunteers

767
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,960
for the military are being rejected

768
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,820
because they're obese so once again

769
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,940
we're back to having trouble raising an

770
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:26,439
army so the US government is starting to

771
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,210
pay attention to this pretty seriously

772
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,590
and then you have these predictions of

773
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:34,179
serious food shortages across the planet

774
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:36,669
by 2050 so it's questionable whether

775
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:39,519
we've even solved that one problem but

776
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:42,400
we've certainly that that one problem of

777
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,889
he who has no food has only one problem

778
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,450
you as food has many problems we have

779
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:51,130
enough calories we still got some issues

780
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:53,440
so these are some of the issues that the

781
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:56,320
Ohio State discovery themes are meant to

782
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,000
have an impact on so the three discovery

783
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,409
themes are energy and environment health

784
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,990
and wellness food production and

785
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:03,340
security if you look at sometimes

786
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,650
they're called Grand Challenges

787
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:08,259
challenge themes they come by different

788
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,360
names in different universities these

789
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:13,359
are not unique to Ohio State you'll find

790
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:16,269
those themes elsewhere but these are the

791
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:19,240
three that are trustees back in about

792
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:21,579
2010 several years ago figured were

793
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:26,650
themes that Ohio State would have

794
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:29,470
strengths to resolve so they were

795
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,509
willing to put some resources into those

796
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,460
strengths and a new tipped you off on

797
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:35,710
the amount that's being invested there

798
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,000
is this new source of revenue at Ohio

799
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,640
State miss because someone in the

800
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,259
business office figured out that we're

801
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,410
university so why are we screwing around

802
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:46,329
with managing parking lots and there are

803
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,820
a lot of parking places on the Cologne

804
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:51,278
campus about 35,000 of them so running

805
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:53,139
the parking lots is kind of a big effort

806
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,669
I figured well let's lease that to

807
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,230
somebody else let them do the parking

808
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:58,419
lots won't focus on research and

809
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,980
education so they leased it to a company

810
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:01,778
from Australia for four hundred and

811
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,409
eighty five million dollars over the

812
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:07,960
next 50 years which is a big slug of new

813
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:09,278
resources and someone else in the

814
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,460
Provost office said you know you should

815
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:14,409
tie that to faculty salaries so there

816
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:17,440
was a decision because faculty are

817
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:20,110
revenue generators so that's the route

818
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,360
that we go and then we had a Provost who

819
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:24,908
is also very willing to make this very

820
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:27,129
bottom up so from the very beginning

821
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:29,980
it's been you know faculty you tell us

822
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:32,080
how you want this to work started with

823
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,120
faculty advisory boards and laying out

824
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:37,418
what are the sub themes within those big

825
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:39,668
three that we might actually be able to

826
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:41,350
address the Ohio State and then we did

827
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:44,440
the cluster analysis and they kind of

828
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:47,949
clustered into data analytics food for

829
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,500
health materials and energy and then

830
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:52,750
infectious diseases so there were calls

831
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:56,769
for proposals in each of those and I'd

832
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:59,019
let a group around climate in the

833
00:32:56,769 --> 00:33:01,720
environment on developing a framework

834
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:03,819
for data analytics and then the next

835
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,009
round of proposals came out on these

836
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:08,769
other three themes and together with

837
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:11,879
about 50 faculty across the university

838
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:16,659
we came up with a proposal for food

839
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,399
security just going into some of the

840
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:20,528
questions on who was asking this was a

841
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:22,689
result of about 20 years of reaching out

842
00:33:20,528 --> 00:33:24,250
across the university through the agro

843
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,019
ecosystems management program and

844
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:28,179
developing relationships with people in

845
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:29,440
other colleges so when we put out the

846
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:31,028
call for the email is they may want to

847
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,130
get together and talk about this

848
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:35,319
we had people showing up from many

849
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:37,090
different colleges that we already were

850
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:38,288
working with so people in the Department

851
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:39,819
of art the Knowlton School of

852
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:42,730
Architecture Glenn School of Public

853
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:45,069
Affairs public our College of Social

854
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:46,750
Work so it was a very diverse group that

855
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:49,450
showed up on the table and developed

856
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:52,690
this proposal that became in fact

857
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:55,650
and this is the vision and approach that

858
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:58,150
we become a worldwide leader in

859
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:01,000
conceptual models but also practical

860
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:04,540
examples of a transform food and

861
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,320
agriculture that leads to secure

862
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:10,509
equitable food security for all that we

863
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,850
start with the food system that we own

864
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:16,510
at Ohio State University because we own

865
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:18,099
about a depending on who you talk to and

866
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,020
which day somewhere between thirty and

867
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:22,659
thirty nine million dollar annual food

868
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:26,800
bill between student dining the medical

869
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:28,779
school all the ways that we procure food

870
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,730
at Ohio State it's going to take

871
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,730
collaboration across the sciences

872
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:35,530
engineering and humanities as well as

873
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:38,199
outside of the university with many

874
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:40,300
partners outside it takes a holistic and

875
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,369
transformative approach this is not

876
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,679
tinkering and solving one problem after

877
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:47,079
the next the whack-a-mole game this

878
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,690
really is taking a transformative

879
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:52,000
approach and it does start with the

880
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:56,679
thirty new hires now another interesting

881
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:00,159
little sidelight is when we were given

882
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:03,519
the go-ahead to proceed with in fact it

883
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,960
was a go ahead on these thirty hires so

884
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,519
we had proposed that we're gonna start

885
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,050
with our own food system and we're gonna

886
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:09,969
change our campus landscape

887
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:13,720
nobody was putting us in charge like

888
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:16,149
campus dining or the campus landscapes

889
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:18,609
and the like so since then just last

890
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,920
year there was a set of sustainability

891
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:24,849
goals set by the university one of which

892
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,220
was increase the production and purchase

893
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:31,900
of locally and sustainably sourced food

894
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:33,279
to forty percent by 2025 and the provost

895
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,230
and vice president for student life

896
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,940
commissioned a panel that's now being

897
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:39,219
chaired by myself our executive director

898
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,619
the head of Dining Services and a

899
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:44,289
student to figure out the action plan so

900
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:46,809
we actually do have our hands on the

901
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:48,960
Ohio State food system now and can make

902
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:51,779
that part of this initiative

903
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,190
as well as the kind of research and

904
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,970
teaching and outreach that these new

905
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:59,130
faculty colleagues will be pursuing so

906
00:35:56,969 --> 00:36:02,719
five main areas where we're doing this

907
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:05,519
hiring of the thirty hires one is in

908
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:07,559
climate-resilient food production and

909
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,480
it's it's actually not just production

910
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:11,989
it's also the processing the

911
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:15,780
preservation the distribution logistics

912
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:19,979
so it's that entire food system from the

913
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:23,070
the soil to the plate and it's not just

914
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:25,139
about changing a particular system it's

915
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:27,300
thinking about diversifying that entire

916
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:29,699
approach so here's a good example this

917
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,500
is Coachella ba Bo the guy in the center

918
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:33,299
there and he's one of several people

919
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,679
I've met who just decided you know this

920
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,240
food system doesn't work for our

921
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:38,608
neighborhood so they heck with it I just

922
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:40,649
do in my own and so he started clearing

923
00:36:38,608 --> 00:36:42,769
off vacant lots getting the Somali youth

924
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:47,338
in the neighborhood to help with it

925
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:49,349
producing collards African basil selling

926
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:51,539
and preparing it and selling it in the

927
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:54,390
new harvest cafe which is behind that

928
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:56,039
mural and these are some of my students

929
00:36:54,389 --> 00:37:00,809
trying to keep up with them it's a very

930
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:02,909
energetic guy and so it's it's about you

931
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:05,279
know how do we diversify any given

932
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:09,618
system and across systems of production

933
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:13,019
and and and the rest of the food chain

934
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:15,180
there's a medic medical and nutritional

935
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:17,130
and health dimension to this so the

936
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:19,319
medical community is embracing this idea

937
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,588
that food is health I don't know where

938
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:26,369
they heard that but there's this is a

939
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:27,838
garden that's being developed by one of

940
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,650
my colleagues in the medical school the

941
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,500
school of health and rehabilitation

942
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:34,190
science for cancer survivors and what

943
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,929
she's doing is checking the biometric

944
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:38,730
stats on the cancer survivors that are

945
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:40,348
out there working in the garden putting

946
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:42,838
numbers behind this idea that this

947
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:44,309
actually is really good for you to get

948
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:48,559
involved in this kind of thing and ship

949
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:52,949
your diet and to be working outdoors

950
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:54,329
producing food and sharing it so there's

951
00:37:52,949 --> 00:37:57,509
the nutrition and health

952
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:59,848
there's the policy dimension because

953
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,550
policy does shape our school system or

954
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:04,269
our

955
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:06,010
food system works so this is a site

956
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:07,838
maintained at the Glenn College of

957
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,790
Public Affairs a colleague Jill Clark

958
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:11,679
who's done a great job of holding local

959
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:14,829
food policy councils together in Ohio

960
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,289
since we had a state food policy council

961
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:19,810
haven't had it since the last

962
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:22,719
administration came into into power but

963
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:25,269
we've been pulling together this group

964
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:27,879
of many local councils into a statewide

965
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:30,400
coalition there's an entrepreneurship

966
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,079
and business opportunity to all this if

967
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,730
you're going to develop new local and

968
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,800
regional supply chain there's an

969
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,690
opportunity for new businesses and this

970
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,859
was a study done by the bush consulting

971
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,338
group for the fund for our economic

972
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:44,380
future in Northeast Ohio where they

973
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:46,838
identified that both in terms of jobs on

974
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,730
the left and revenues on the right what

975
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:51,489
you could get out of the agricultural

976
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:55,838
Biosciences so it's agriculture RIT very

977
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:57,519
broadly it is much greater than some of

978
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,949
these other areas like Advanced Energy

979
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:01,509
industrial water flexible electronics

980
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:04,328
that people were kind of gaga over

981
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:07,359
because they're high tech and that top

982
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:10,869
part of the bar after the big thick bar

983
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:12,880
here that is import substitution so it's

984
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:14,588
basically producing in Ohio what

985
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,599
otherwise we would be imported

986
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:20,380
it's an enormous economic opportunity so

987
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,849
entrepreneurship and business are part

988
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,858
of it and then finally culture and

989
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:28,210
that's why it's a capital C in

990
00:39:23,858 --> 00:39:29,920
agriculture because this food is very

991
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:31,568
basic to our culture I've done this

992
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,230
exercise of asking students you know

993
00:39:31,568 --> 00:39:37,269
reflect on your experience with food and

994
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:40,059
invariably it very quickly gravitates to

995
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:43,869
special occasions with family often

996
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:46,509
religious holidays so that is culture

997
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:49,450
there's a cultural dimension to this the

998
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:52,540
top left picture is worldwide there are

999
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:54,848
many different approaches to food in

1000
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:56,739
different cultures the bottom picture is

1001
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:58,480
actually Columbus Columbus public health

1002
00:39:56,739 --> 00:40:01,509
market so we have a very diverse

1003
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,000
community in Columbus Ohio as well as in

1004
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:05,410
a lot of the United States and at the

1005
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,480
end of the day it's one of these kids

1006
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:07,589
experiencing

1007
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,280
and how are they going to grow up

1008
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:13,829
thinking about food and food systems so

1009
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,980
those are the five broad areas these are

1010
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:18,569
the the position descriptions or the

1011
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,809
position titles wherever there's a

1012
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:24,180
Buckeye there's somebody already hired

1013
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:26,880
six of those are already on campus so

1014
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:30,509
everybody but this one sheet she arrives

1015
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,480
Ingrid Adams arrives from Kentucky on

1016
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,609
December 1st all of the green circles

1017
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,820
are searches that are underway the

1018
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:40,079
yellow ones are search or positions that

1019
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,539
are kind of Chum during through the

1020
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,829
approval process and the white ones are

1021
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:45,389
the ones that we've still got a little

1022
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:47,789
bit of work to do and the deal here is

1023
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:50,400
the office of academic affairs is

1024
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:51,960
providing half of a salary for each of

1025
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,690
these positions the other half has to

1026
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,460
come from the department of college that

1027
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:59,070
that person is gonna be in a lot of new

1028
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,199
partnerships being built here so this

1029
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,180
food health and human behaviors College

1030
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,059
of Medicine but the person's actually

1031
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:08,849
tenured in extension it's never happened

1032
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:10,170
before this agro ecosystems management

1033
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:11,849
is going to be shared between the

1034
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,670
Department of horticulture and crop

1035
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:16,469
sciences and animal sciences we've never

1036
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,750
had a position shared between those two

1037
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:20,429
units before so we are pushing the

1038
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,989
culture within the university and to me

1039
00:41:20,429 --> 00:41:24,690
that's one of the most important things

1040
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:26,608
here we got together as a group of

1041
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,099
faculty across 10 different colleges and

1042
00:41:26,608 --> 00:41:31,049
came up with these ideas and now we're

1043
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:33,029
going to departments that's completely

1044
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,800
different from the way it has worked for

1045
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,480
my entire career at Ohio State it's

1046
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,630
always been strictly within a department

1047
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,670
and I checked with our administrators we

1048
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,070
think this is right that's the last time

1049
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:46,320
we got together and talked about who we

1050
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:48,119
were gonna hire and why as a faculty

1051
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,920
across the universe actually these are

1052
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,869
not faculty those are students this is

1053
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,990
actually the first graduating class at

1054
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:56,608
Ohio State and that's a very famous

1055
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:58,079
stereoscope photo so it's the deal where

1056
00:41:56,608 --> 00:42:00,449
you put the thing in there and to look

1057
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,279
at it one on each eye that comes to 3d

1058
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:05,099
so anyway but it was a long time ago

1059
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,600
that was about 1870 and this is just the

1060
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:09,269
first step the hiring the people in the

1061
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,670
next step is weaving the network so

1062
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:12,559
we've actually envisioned

1063
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,990
the network that we would expect between

1064
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,820
departments interdisciplinary programs

1065
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:18,979
external partners for all 30 of these

1066
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:21,110
people so that inner ring is the 30 new

1067
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:24,230
hires and all those lines if you can

1068
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:26,480
possibly follow them is the network that

1069
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,769
we would expect initially and it'll be

1070
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,719
interesting to see how the network

1071
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:32,210
actually developed but that's the next

1072
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:33,679
real chore for me that's faculty

1073
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,019
director so that's the handbook that's

1074
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:38,000
on my desk these days the network weaver

1075
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:41,030
June Hawley is right down in Athens and

1076
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,429
this a real innovator in network weaving

1077
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:46,790
I'll just give you a real quick sample

1078
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:48,619
of one of the projects that's emerging

1079
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:50,269
because I'm involved in this one but we

1080
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:52,159
have a linkage and leverage Grants

1081
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:54,440
Program so linkages how many people can

1082
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:58,099
unique connect leverages how well can

1083
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:01,220
you use it as a seed for new resources

1084
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:05,750
coming in and those are on our website

1085
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:09,199
which you'll see them in yeah so here's

1086
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:11,239
the food mapping team we did a study in

1087
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,460
the Gulf Coast counties of Mississippi

1088
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:16,099
where we looked at what's the cost of a

1089
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:18,769
representative low cost balanced diet

1090
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:20,929
the USDA thrifty food plan as a function

1091
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:23,570
of where you live so it's the cost of

1092
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:25,369
all the items in the USDA plan as well

1093
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:28,010
as the cost of getting around to round

1094
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:29,929
it all up and that changes as a function

1095
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:31,760
of where you live that's the map it's

1096
00:43:29,929 --> 00:43:33,199
about a two-fold difference if you don't

1097
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,420
have a car it's about a four fold

1098
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:36,949
difference and we did this because I've

1099
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,659
never really liked this idea of food

1100
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:39,980
deserts that there's a line here and

1101
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:42,139
it's a food desert there and it's not

1102
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,300
over here you have these places where

1103
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:48,949
it's a very gradual transition in the

1104
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:50,870
increasing cost and the point is that we

1105
00:43:48,949 --> 00:43:52,219
say very blithely food is cheap in

1106
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:54,380
America well it depends on where you

1107
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:56,539
live and who you are and the real

1108
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,240
interesting part that we're gonna repeat

1109
00:43:56,539 --> 00:44:01,489
the study in Columbus to get at this is

1110
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:03,919
what's the median income for people in

1111
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:06,259
those areas that are in red and how big

1112
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,030
a percentage of their income is it the

1113
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,240
other project that we're working on in

1114
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:14,960
addition to doing that food scape in

1115
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:17,089
Columbus is new faculty hire in the data

1116
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,769
analytics initiative who's doing an

1117
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:21,010
agent-based model of people how people

1118
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:23,050
actually respond to that Lance

1119
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:25,480
and of course they cut corners it

1120
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:27,130
affects the diet and we have colleagues

1121
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,380
in the medical school who can get from

1122
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:31,030
diet to what are the health outcomes so

1123
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,579
if you're talking about the answer is a

1124
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:35,470
new grocery store somewhere or a new bus

1125
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:37,719
line somewhere you have a way of

1126
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:39,549
predicting who is that gonna help and

1127
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:42,069
how much and what's the health outcome

1128
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:43,420
could it be so that's a flavor of the

1129
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:46,559
kind of research that we're pulling

1130
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:48,940
people together to do that's the website

1131
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,858
we've hired Bryan Snyder as our

1132
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,929
executive director he's just starting

1133
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:54,250
and I better stop there and take some

1134
00:44:52,929 --> 00:44:56,019
questions if there are any but I'm

1135
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,820
around tomorrow as well so I'd be glad

1136
00:44:56,019 --> 00:45:00,840
to get together with you and pursue this

1137
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,840
further thanks again

1138
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:23,690
would encourage the establishment arts

1139
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:26,519
especially under resource your program

1140
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:29,880
any relationship with that growing

1141
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:31,980
we already do bring to green or the

1142
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,230
middle have a food bank and children's

1143
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:37,440
hunger Alliance Columbus public health

1144
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:39,690
there are quite a few partners and

1145
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,909
they're really the ones that can help

1146
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:44,220
one of the things that were we have a

1147
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:46,230
pending proposal that would allow us to

1148
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:49,348
take this new purchasing that Ohio State

1149
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:52,050
is willing to do and directed at the

1150
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:54,720
community and people who get people help

1151
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:57,330
in getting instant reduction if that

1152
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:59,159
would help their situation I'm not

1153
00:45:57,329 --> 00:46:00,869
worried about whether it's full-time or

1154
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:05,429
part-time I think hard times actually it

1155
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:06,660
was mine but to do that those folks are

1156
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,940
going to need a lot of support of the

1157
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:09,289
training

1158
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,570
things like that we have a tremendous

1159
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:13,099
number of community partners have any

1160
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:15,320
hope for that sort of thing so yeah

1161
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:17,179
absolutely and then you know we talk

1162
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:20,720
about agricultural transformation

1163
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:22,759
transformation we can help it urgent

1164
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,069
from the university research and

1165
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,170
education the transformation that

1166
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:32,559
happens outside with the exception of

1167
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:32,559
the food system that's why

1168
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:38,028
question we have questions up in Geneva

1169
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:41,618
sorry we have a tradition to do it this

1170
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:45,699
way listener you recognize those case

1171
00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:45,700
done necessarily is amazing

1172
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,539
was there a question

1173
00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:53,529
yeah

1174
00:46:56,150 --> 00:47:01,930
State 22 deer down the line

1175
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:11,690
okay that was my to graduate school in

1176
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:11,690
February and we're right back to this

1177
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:19,588
Antonio asked what's my vision for the

1178
00:47:15,509 --> 00:47:21,719
food system programs at Ohio State 20 30

1179
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:23,130
years down the line I'd like to see this

1180
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:25,108
initiative grow I think there's an

1181
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:27,059
expectation that it becomes part of the

1182
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:30,239
formal structure at Ohio State

1183
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:31,470
University what's more important to me

1184
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,568
is that it becomes part of the culture

1185
00:47:31,469 --> 00:47:35,909
at Ohio State that we continue this

1186
00:47:33,568 --> 00:47:38,849
tradition of getting together across the

1187
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:41,038
colleges to talk about Louie hire why

1188
00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:43,680
and how we can progress on some of these

1189
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:45,660
really big challenges and also how we

1190
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:47,818
partner with the people outside the

1191
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:50,248
university who are really the agents of

1192
00:47:47,818 --> 00:47:52,978
change out there so that would be my

1193
00:47:50,248 --> 00:47:55,738
vision is that this leads to a

1194
00:47:52,978 --> 00:47:58,139
transformation in the way we operate and

1195
00:47:55,739 --> 00:48:00,679
a transformation having food and

1196
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:00,679
agriculture

1197
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:08,719
whether they're hurdles both

1198
00:48:05,769 --> 00:48:11,030
domestically and internationally yeah I

1199
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,429
would I would say in the hurdles are

1200
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:16,640
many and they would be in each of those

1201
00:48:13,429 --> 00:48:20,440
five dimensions I mentioned so there are

1202
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:23,539
hurdles that have to do with how do you

1203
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,250
gain new economies in production not

1204
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:28,610
just economy of scale but kind of your

1205
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:31,579
scope how do you things like we have a

1206
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:34,940
strong group in precision agriculture so

1207
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:36,920
how do you take that technology and make

1208
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:40,940
it scale independent so that's helping

1209
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:43,280
farmers across any different scale you

1210
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,710
know one example of the kind of research

1211
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,860
that would be needed to to get to that

1212
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:51,250
vision so there's I think hurdles

1213
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:55,220
they're hurdles in the health fields

1214
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:58,309
policy the business and entrepreneurship

1215
00:48:55,219 --> 00:49:00,649
and you know how the private sector

1216
00:48:58,309 --> 00:49:03,469
engages with this and then finally

1217
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:06,440
culture you know how is it that we have

1218
00:49:03,469 --> 00:49:08,659
16% the low household and food security

1219
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,220
in Ohio and nobody knows about it and

1220
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:12,319
nobody is out screaming and

1221
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:14,359
demonstrating in the street so there's a

1222
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:17,200
cultural dimension and a cultural hurdle

1223
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:20,200
to overcome on this both here in

1224
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:20,199
innovation

1225
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:43,839
however changing the radiance

1226
00:49:40,298 --> 00:49:45,608
yeah great question because I've been

1227
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:48,099
working folks in landscape architecture

1228
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:49,778
for two years before we're and well I

1229
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:53,559
haven't city and regional planning which

1230
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:55,298
is also in school of architecture and

1231
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:56,798
those folks are you know very interested

1232
00:49:55,298 --> 00:50:05,559
in this question that's how do you plan

1233
00:49:56,798 --> 00:50:06,849
or Landscape Architecture designers tend

1234
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:08,979
to look at these things in a very

1235
00:50:06,849 --> 00:50:11,859
holistic way but a completely different

1236
00:50:08,978 --> 00:50:13,838
way that I work so I already gained

1237
00:50:11,858 --> 00:50:16,028
something from talking to landscape

1238
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:18,338
architecture there live landscape

1239
00:50:16,028 --> 00:50:22,268
architects and how they're designing but

1240
00:50:18,338 --> 00:50:24,578
they design a very similar principle to

1241
00:50:22,268 --> 00:50:26,198
what we're designing agricultural

1242
00:50:24,579 --> 00:50:28,359
production practices and things like

1243
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:30,729
that where they're they're building in

1244
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:33,338
ecological and economic and social

1245
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:34,858
dimensions of the design and you need to

1246
00:50:33,338 --> 00:50:36,159
understand that I was in a design

1247
00:50:34,858 --> 00:50:38,318
charrette

1248
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:41,318
last week in landscape architecture on

1249
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:45,009
adaptive agro ecology and this is one of

1250
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:47,498
our supporters Lipchitz she came from

1251
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:49,748
Helles to you she's featured this month

1252
00:50:47,498 --> 00:50:52,058
on the cover of landscape architecture

1253
00:50:49,748 --> 00:50:54,968
magazine but where she was doing in the

1254
00:50:52,059 --> 00:50:58,809
catfish run and she works at these very

1255
00:50:54,969 --> 00:51:01,119
broad agro-ecosystem scales and and is

1256
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:02,589
interested in visualizing what who knew

1257
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,749
who had laid those systems might look

1258
00:51:02,588 --> 00:51:06,009
like and you know what do they look like

1259
00:51:04,748 --> 00:51:08,498
now how are you where are the

1260
00:51:06,009 --> 00:51:10,269
opportunities to search anything so this

1261
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:13,748
design charrette I asked in the middle

1262
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:15,818
of it had a common key it's you're

1263
00:51:13,748 --> 00:51:17,618
really doing a good job you know

1264
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:20,438
bringing those principles and most of

1265
00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:22,419
them actually have not had a course in

1266
00:51:20,438 --> 00:51:25,618
the ecology and it becomes the reading

1267
00:51:22,418 --> 00:51:27,659
that they have to catch up

1268
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:29,430
so I think you know that's that's an

1269
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:31,318
example where we have something to

1270
00:51:29,429 --> 00:51:33,000
contribute to what they're doing in

1271
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:34,558
landscape architecture they're very

1272
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,019
quick to reach out to us to help

1273
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:51,809
especially with that part of it but then

1274
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:53,849
they also come up with these ideas this

1275
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:59,630
has been a production of Cornell

1276
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:59,630
University on the web at Cornell edu
