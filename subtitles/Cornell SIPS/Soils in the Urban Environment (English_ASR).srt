1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,039
thank you nina and good afternoon

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,638
everybody thank you for joining today me

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,719
today for the seminar

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,679
um so to give you a little overview of

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,640
what we're going to be talking about

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,600
today

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,439
we're going to i'm going to talk a

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
little bit about just very briefly

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,800
research in botanic gardens in general

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
i'm getting the master's in public

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,000
garden leadership so i want to kind of

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,599
give a perspective on that and then i'm

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,359
going to jump into some research i

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,359
helped out with at the morton arboretum

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,559
in chicago last summer

18
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,000
and i'm going to finish up by talking

19
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,558
about some of the research i've been

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,558
involved with while here at cornell

21
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,839
so in botanic gardens there's been a

22
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:48,558
history of research that's dated back

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,760
about 500 years now with the earliest

24
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,079
iterations of what we'd actually

25
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,079
consider a botanic garden

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,920
there was a research focus at these

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,719
institutions the first kind of botanic

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
gardens that we really considered seeing

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,679
in the in the

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,199
world were what was known as the physics

31
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,920
gardens and these were gardens that were

32
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,319
associated with universities and usually

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,719
primary and primarily were focused

34
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,399
on teaching students about medicinal

35
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,039
plants and

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,520
for for doctors who were studying so the

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,118
first gardens to be established were in

38
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:23,359
italy at the university of pisa

39
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,560
and even from back in this date

40
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,478
we see that research has been an

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
important part of what they do

42
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,319
stepping into the more modern day

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,840
some of the research that we see

44
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,919
that has kind of traditionally happened

45
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,960
at botanic gardens has really been work

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,400
mostly around systematics so looking at

47
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,478
phylogenetic relationships of plants and

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,240
classification particularly with plant

49
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,159
or exploration

50
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,519
and the work that was going on of

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,759
bringing plants from other parts of the

52
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,879
world and classifying them as well as

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,879
floristics floristics being looking at

54
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,118
plants from the perspective of

55
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,798
biogeography

56
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,680
and the distribution of the different

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,680
species and what affects speciation

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,159
in this way and this work has of course

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,080
been supported by herbarium work the

60
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,000
drying of physical plants to do this

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,840
kind of taxonomic description but then

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,318
also increasingly with living

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
collections so bringing seed back or

64
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,479
living plants and growing the modern

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,959
collections and using them for this type

66
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,719
of study

67
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,080
kind of more some more modern focuses

68
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,840
that we're starting to see

69
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
more gardens putting emphasis on is

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,280
definitely conservation biology and the

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,598
disciplines that go on within that

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,680
chicago botanic garden and missouri

73
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,439
botanic garden being two examples of

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,599
gardens that have a strong focus on

75
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,000
plant conservation and the associated

76
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,000
fields

77
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,759
and of course horticultural research has

78
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,280
also been an important topic that

79
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,799
botanic gardens have played a very

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,318
active role in

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,000
like i mentioned particularly with plant

82
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,399
exploration going to new parts of the

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,680
world bringing plants back and then with

84
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,120
that subsequent plant introduction

85
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,280
and when we grow these plants on in our

86
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,599
living collections we start we also give

87
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,280
us an opportunity for plant evaluation

88
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,518
such as disease screening or pest

89
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,318
screening and this is in many ways tied

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,599
into plant breeding programs and

91
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,518
really gardens have started to become

92
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,719
more of just a place nice place to go

93
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,239
visit and see plants from around the

94
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,840
world but we're starting more and more

95
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,080
to consider them as what we would

96
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,840
consider a germplasm repository where

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,840
these wild collected plants are

98
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,759
representations of their wild

99
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,239
populations which can then be used for

100
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,840
study conservation or plant breeding as

101
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,759
i mentioned

102
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
so that's a very brief overview overview

103
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,359
of research in botanic gardens and with

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
that i'm going to transition in to talk

105
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,000
a little bit about the work i did at the

106
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,279
morton arboretum

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
for people who aren't familiar with the

108
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
public garden leadership program between

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,560
your first and the second year all the

110
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,399
fellows in the program go to

111
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,959
somewhere in the united states

112
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,280
and participate in an internship

113
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,959
i found myself at the morton arboretum

114
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,158
for a number of reasons they've got an

115
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,519
excellent plant collection that i was

116
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,798
very interested in interacting with

117
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,599
but the more in arboretum to give a

118
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,840
general overview is 1700 acres so quite

119
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,280
a large garden and it's more than just

120
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,519
the arboretum they focus on more than

121
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,680
plants they have natural areas as well

122
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,599
as prairies a number of formal gardens

123
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,200
too such as a children's garden which is

124
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,798
a great way to diversify your gardens to

125
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,959
get different types of audiences to come

126
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,918
and visit

127
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,000
and they also have some other

128
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,599
specialized gardens like a hedge garden

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,600
fragrance garden

130
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,479
they have a 27 million dollar annual

131
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,439
budget

132
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,199
employ over 350 employees including

133
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,439
part-time and seasonals

134
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,639
and this garden was established in 1922

135
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,319
by joy morton and people will typically

136
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,199
know the morton name

137
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,040
as the as the salt empire and people

138
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,560
that

139
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
in that industry

140
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,240
and at the morton arboretum they've got

141
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,519
many thousands living plants but they

142
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,918
have four uh

143
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,839
4 100 different specific taxa so

144
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,359
different species or subspecies growing

145
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,478
on the ground

146
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,160
and the warren arboretum was an

147
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,519
interesting place to go because of their

148
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,479
living collections and because it is

149
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,159
such a widely visited garden

150
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,879
but they also have a very well developed

151
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,960
research program at the morton arboretum

152
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,478
and they focus on a broad number of

153
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,879
disciplines

154
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,478
from plant systematics some of our more

155
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,038
traditional research we'd find in

156
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,279
gardens to forest ecology

157
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,360
actually robert fahey bob fahey who's

158
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,719
the son of tim fey he's who some folks

159
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,960
might be familiar with and natural

160
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,840
resources works there they also focus on

161
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,959
plant conservation arboriculture root

162
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,638
biology

163
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,079
and the lab i was most interested in

164
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,038
working with was the urban soils lab

165
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,439
so dr bryant sharon brock heads up the

166
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,120
mass soil science laboratory and what

167
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,240
makes their lab a little bit interesting

168
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,600
is they have a number of different

169
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,319
areas of research interest but they

170
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,039
really focus on urban soils and urban

171
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,839
ecosystems as their central focus

172
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,038
such as in urban ecology and

173
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,359
biochemistry and assessment and

174
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,519
remediation of urban soils they also do

175
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,240
some focus on forest management as well

176
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,839
as prairie studies and these two kind of

177
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,079
last two areas the prairie ecology and

178
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,359
forest management

179
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,038
are is actually a lot of the research

180
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,240
that gets done physically on the grounds

181
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:09,439
of the morton arboretum so that's

182
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,879
something has something that makes them

183
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,319
a little different as well is that they

184
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,120
use their landscape and view their

185
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,039
landscape as a living laboratory

186
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,720
and to give a kind of overview of of

187
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:19,918
what bryant's lab looks like because it

188
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,960
is a little different than what we tend

189
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,599
to see

190
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,519
in the academic setting is that bryant

191
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
has been there for five years

192
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,000
he's done he's published 12 publications

193
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,080
and done 53 presentations at this point

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,439
but one of the major differences is that

195
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,839
there's only two employees in the lab

196
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,519
his lab manager and himself

197
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,679
and he's works with graduate students

198
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,599
but not specifically as chairs for

199
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,360
committees more kind of tangentially

200
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,280
like the way he's worked with me

201
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,038
and he does sit on some committees but

202
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,038
where he kind of makes up the difference

203
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,680
in productivity that graduate students

204
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,079
will bring to a lab is in his use of

205
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,840
volunteers so in five years he's used

206
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,159
his hat ended up having over 150

207
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:01,439
volunteers in his lab as well as 41

208
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,880
interns it appears

209
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,639
yeah and he'll enlist he'll enlist

210
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,680
anyone that he can including his

211
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,120
children um to do lab work

212
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,959
um

213
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,319
and this is something that is you know

214
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,959
volunteers are something that botanic

215
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,639
gardens heavily used to to help fulfill

216
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,079
their work and their missions and this

217
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,918
is just one example because it's an

218
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,079
interesting one of how his lab can still

219
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,439
be very productive but in a slightly

220
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,079
different context than what we may be

221
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,079
familiar with

222
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,639
so jumping into urban soils which is

223
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,959
going to be what we talked about for the

224
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,000
remainder of this talk i'm going to read

225
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,959
this definition because i think it

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,598
really sums up what urban soils are

227
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,000
urban soils are non-agricultural

228
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,598
man-made surface layer more than 50

229
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,839
centimeters thick that have been

230
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,199
produced by a mixing filling or

231
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,000
contamination

232
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,439
of land in urban or suburban areas so

233
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,800
really what we're talking about here is

234
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,800
we're talking about soils that aren't

235
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,720
agricultural aren't found in a natural

236
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,400
ecosystem and typically in one way or

237
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,440
another are adversely or are impacted by

238
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,719
human use or human presence

239
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,759
and why is this an important area of

240
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
study

241
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,759
it's important in area study

242
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,199
particularly in the united states

243
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,439
because in the next 40 years we're

244
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,879
projected to have five percent more

245
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:17,279
urban areas in the united states alone

246
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,599
and humans have unique impacts

247
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,519
that alter the soil's biogeochemical

248
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,918
processes and really make them a

249
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,598
distinct and unique system

250
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,878
so in surveys of urban soils that have

251
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:28,240
been done

252
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,720
we tend to see a suite of

253
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,799
characteristics that we will find such

254
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,440
as high bulk densities decreases in

255
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,120
organic matter poor structure

256
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,039
high ph

257
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,599
low water holding capacity

258
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,838
decrease in aggregate stability

259
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,000
inadequate soil depth for root growth

260
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,000
and a decrease in microbial biomass

261
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
so when i was at the morton arboretum i

262
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,120
specifically helped out with the chicago

263
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,120
urban forestry study

264
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,800
and the chicago urban forestry study

265
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,399
was a joint study between the morton

266
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,240
arboretum and the u.s department of

267
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,320
agriculture

268
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
and there was two main pis on it it was

269
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,080
bryant sharon brock in the urban soil

270
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,159
science lab as well as bob fahey in

271
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,000
forest ecology i'm primarily going to be

272
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,559
talking about this first area

273
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,480
the second area

274
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,799
robert fahey was mostly looking using

275
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,600
dendrochronology techniques to look at

276
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:26,639
how the urban forest was responding to

277
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,399
uh different differences in

278
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,759
different climatic events so

279
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,639
particularly drought he wanted to see

280
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,319
how the forest is responding to that

281
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,600
and the justification for the study is

282
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,680
that there had been no comprehensive

283
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,399
study of carbon storage that had been

284
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,399
conducted in an urban system based on

285
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,000
different land use types

286
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,320
and then looking at the soils both in a

287
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,320
shallow 20 centimeters as well as deep

288
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,839
up to a meter in depth in some places

289
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,839
deeper than that even

290
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,159
and this is important because in the

291
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,680
urban environment

292
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,600
soils themselves make up the single

293
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,039
largest terrestrial sink of carbon with

294
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,879
up to 64

295
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,799
followed by vegetation which are two

296
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,559
factors that we considered in the study

297
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,000
so looking at about eighty four percent

298
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,639
of all the carbon that cycles in the

299
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,639
urban system

300
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,559
and the study that was conducted in two

301
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,079
thousand by jogobi and jackson they

302
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,278
looked at uh three different natural

303
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,319
land

304
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,240
ecosystems land types and looked at how

305
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,120
carbon was distributed within the top

306
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,959
centimeter of soil based on these three

307
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,480
three land types and what they found

308
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,759
from this initial study was that in

309
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,360
troubling

310
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,958
you had a larger percentage of carbon

311
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
distributed in the deeper part of your

312
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,078
soils

313
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,159
on one end of the spectrum while in

314
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,399
forest and forest lands you ended up

315
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,078
with carbon primarily in your top 20

316
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,759
centimeters of soil

317
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,359
and this was mostly explained in the

318
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:49,278
shrubland systems as by how deep the

319
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,278
roots were going and turning over in the

320
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,039
soil and with the forest like in

321
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,600
deciduous forests with leaves or coarse

322
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,838
woody debris accumulating you find a

323
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,360
higher carbon in the in the top 20

324
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,279
centimeters so

325
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,720
brian kind of looked at this idea

326
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,879
and and thought about where he could

327
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,399
where he could move forward with it and

328
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,078
the two types of carbon that we wanted

329
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,839
to look at in these systems were organic

330
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,679
carbon as most people will be familiar

331
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,079
with or carbon that's derived from a

332
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,159
living source either plant or animal and

333
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,159
living in dead microorganisms

334
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:23,360
but he also wanted to look at inorganic

335
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:26,000
carbon which in soils typically reforms

336
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,320
to carbon found in a carbonate form

337
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,480
which is derived from mineral parent

338
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,560
material and

339
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,159
in urban systems in particular organic

340
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,239
inorganic carbon is is more of a

341
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,919
question of protection than is about

342
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,440
sequestration

343
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,559
with all the disturbances that go on

344
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,800
urban ecosystems by

345
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,799
exposing these inorganic carbon

346
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,799
deposits you can actually create a

347
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,559
source for carbon into the atmosphere

348
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,519
versus a sink as we may think about with

349
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,518
our organic carbon

350
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,958
so there's a number of factors in

351
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,560
particular that affect carbon cycling

352
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,759
within these soils and what i want to

353
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,879
point out here is that all the ones that

354
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,200
i put stars next to so from here on down

355
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,399
are different factors that can be

356
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,639
affected by land management or by

357
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,958
just how we we use our land our presence

358
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,959
on it

359
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,399
and so carbon cycling within the shallow

360
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,879
part of our soil is primarily derived

361
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,320
from organic carbon we see high rates of

362
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,600
turnover here

363
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,200
and these are sensitive to human

364
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,800
management and typically found in your

365
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,800
organic or your a horizons

366
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,879
we're deeper beyond 20 centimeters it's

367
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,200
a slower turnover rate you find more of

368
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,200
your inorganic carbon sources

369
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,399
and you can also find organic sources

370
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,120
and this is where you start to find your

371
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,839
a horizons your e horizons

372
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,839
and your b horizons as well

373
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,519
so to understand the framework of how

374
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,120
the moon arboretum wanted to construct

375
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,278
the study looking at carbon based on

376
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,360
land use they they went back to a study

377
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,600
that was conducted in 2010 also

378
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,360
supported by the morton arboretum

379
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,759
in 2010 the morning arboretum conducted

380
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,519
a tree census of the chicagoland region

381
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,278
and what the tree census was is they

382
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,600
selected the seven counties around

383
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:11,679
chicago as well as the city itself

384
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,680
and they generated 2076 random plots

385
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,519
they went out to each of these plots and

386
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,359
they looked at

387
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,959
the characterized plots based on two

388
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,039
sets of criteria they looked at the plot

389
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,319
formation so what was the land being

390
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,319
used for

391
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,000
as well as percent tree cover shrub

392
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,000
cover

393
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,600
and the shrub species and then also when

394
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,519
they found trees they would look at the

395
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,360
trees specifically they would

396
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,039
characterize the species the stem

397
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,680
diameter

398
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:40,078
tree height crown height and its general

399
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,958
health how much missing foliage or

400
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,958
dieback had occurred

401
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,879
crown light exposure and as well as

402
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,719
distance to infrastructure or other

403
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,799
buildings and they took all this

404
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,480
information

405
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,078
and they put it they used it in the i

406
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,560
tree model which for people who aren't

407
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,439
familiar with this is a model created by

408
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:03,439
the usda and used by urban foresters or

409
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,600
city planners to quantify the structure

410
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,639
of urban forests within a municipality

411
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,320
town

412
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,079
and what this model does is one it gives

413
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,959
us a breakdown of all the different

414
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,319
species and and how much

415
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,239
canopy cover perhaps you're finding

416
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,760
within within your city but it also puts

417
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
terms

418
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,240
it puts the in terms of ecosystem

419
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,560
services derived in a monetary value as

420
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,320
it can be a way to justify having an

421
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,559
urban forest and maintaining it and

422
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,800
diversifying it

423
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,719
so they use this model and created all

424
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,198
this data and so bryant took this

425
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,680
information and they decided to

426
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:41,599
for this carbon study to take a subset

427
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,399
of these different land use types

428
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
so

429
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,600
these are all the different land use

430
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,440
types that we looked at

431
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,000
in the greater chicagoland region that

432
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,800
we wanted to assess for carbon cycling

433
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,799
in those systems

434
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,958
so we took a number of different types

435
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,278
of samples we took deep samples using

436
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,838
this it's hard to see in this picture

437
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,000
a large soil sampler that takes samples

438
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,000
down to a meter in depth we took shallow

439
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
samples down to 20 centimeters

440
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,720
as well as our litter layer whatever was

441
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,879
primarily on the top of the soil

442
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,720
and we brought these back to the lab and

443
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,198
based on we look at each of the deep

444
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,160
soil profiles based on horizons and

445
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,519
characterize them based on color

446
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,639
ph

447
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,159
texture

448
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,159
bulk density soil moisture

449
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,720
we would also take our litter extracted

450
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,159
and we would set them up and extract any

451
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,399
of the invertebrates

452
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:41,360
as maybe an additional part of the study

453
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,440
that they'll be looking at in the future

454
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,560
so we looked at carbon in three

455
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
different ways

456
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,319
we looked at our inorganic and organic

457
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,159
carbon with elemental analysis and gas

458
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
chromatography and we looked at our

459
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,679
organic carbon particularly in two ways

460
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,559
one is particular organic matter and the

461
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,000
other one is using active carbon i'm

462
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,879
going to talk about these these two

463
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,879
tests

464
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,399
so particular organic matter

465
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,799
is a way of quantifying and looking at

466
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,958
organic matter based on size so what you

467
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,879
do is you you take your organic matter

468
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,799
and divide it from your your sand silts

469
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,278
and your clays and you fraction them

470
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,559
into different size classes

471
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:17,838
each of these signs there's four

472
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,559
different size classes three are

473
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,079
represented here the other one being

474
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,479
smallest organic matter that's

475
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,879
associated with your salt your silts and

476
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,800
your clays your organomineral complex

477
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,120
organic matter and the theory goes is

478
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,479
that the the

479
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,159
the depending on the different size

480
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,560
classes each size class has a different

481
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,319
residency time in the soil

482
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,078
with anywhere from our litter soil

483
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,278
organic matter for being yes less than a

484
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,239
year

485
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,240
or or to our organomineral complexed

486
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,320
organic matter being anywhere from 400

487
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,600
to a thousand years

488
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,560
bryant had done our previous study in

489
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,199
the past where he where he looked at

490
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,439
time since disturbance of sites so how

491
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,359
long it had been since a site had been

492
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,680
in an urban ecosystem had been kind of

493
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,839
created or established and looked at a

494
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,198
particular organic matter and found that

495
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,558
this course

496
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,480
particular organic matter particularly

497
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,078
on the one to two years was a very good

498
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,318
indicator for

499
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,159
microbial biomass microbial biomass

500
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,879
carbon as well as nitrogen

501
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,240
mineralization so this information

502
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,880
if you

503
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,558
could be helped to use and figure out

504
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,959
nitrogen

505
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,879
calculations for street trees is the

506
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,600
three one so this is one way of looking

507
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,919
at or organic matter that the sharon

508
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,839
brock lab is very very fond of and the

509
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,679
other technique that we used was the

510
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,959
active carbon test

511
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,038
so for folks who are familiar with the

512
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,200
soil health test here at cornell this is

513
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,200
the preferred method that they use it's

514
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,120
a potassium permanganate oxidation

515
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,000
process and this has really started to

516
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,319
become in favor for looking at our

517
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,599
uh our labile organic matter our organic

518
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,079
matter that turns over quickly in the

519
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,079
soil because it's really easy to conduct

520
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,918
it's on a colorimetric scale

521
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,798
and they've known that it's sensitive to

522
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,480
changes in management techniques

523
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,160
so

524
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,919
we see that it correlates well with

525
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,160
basal respiration

526
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,160
aggregation and microbial biomass

527
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,798
and so all this information that the

528
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,400
sharon brock work lab is working on is

529
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,119
going to be

530
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:23,200
cycled into the i-tree model itself and

531
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:25,599
used to build a carbon model for soils

532
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,440
based on land use type

533
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,480
just like the i-tree model had been used

534
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,038
to create ecosystem services

535
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,558
for above-ground biomass

536
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,240
so that about sums up the work that i

537
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,918
did at the morton arboretum or was

538
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,599
involved with and i'm going to

539
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,799
transition now

540
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,199
to talk

541
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,960
about the research i've been doing while

542
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,240
i've been at cornell

543
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,160
so for folks

544
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,440
that saw me spoke earlier this year what

545
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,360
i've been working on while i've been

546
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,440
here i've been working in neenah basic

547
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,279
and don rakow and harold van ness on the

548
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,960
scoop and dump technique of soil

549
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,798
remediation

550
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,640
and this technique is

551
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,200
pretty much just what it sounds

552
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,679
we we come in we take compost we put it

553
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,840
on impacted soils or compacted soils at

554
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,360
a rate of six to eight inches and then

555
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,480
we come in with a backhoe physically

556
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,759
lift it up

557
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,279
and drop it

558
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,000
and what this creates is a heterogeneous

559
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,798
soil mixture that landscape plants can

560
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,798
be directly planted into

561
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,798
and then after that after the planting

562
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,400
mulch is added every year as you would

563
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,519
find in most

564
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,519
landscaping contexts

565
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,400
and this technique was developed based

566
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:31,918
on

567
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,038
two kind of studies the first one being

568
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,799
a study done in 1991 by kai rolfe who

569
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,319
came in without adding organic matter

570
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,639
just using a backhoe to physically

571
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,319
fracture soils and what he found when he

572
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,679
did this looking at soil quality he

573
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:48,399
found that soil bulk density decreased

574
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,000
that poor volume increase and soil

575
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,120
resistance so using a pentrometer in

576
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,880
that soil also decreased

577
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,359
secondly a study done finished up in

578
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,960
2007 by nina basic and angela

579
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,038
rivenshield looked at using different

580
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,120
types of organic amendments and seeing

581
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,160
how those affected

582
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,599
soil bulk densities and soil porosities

583
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,360
and that's how we came up with using

584
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,959
this uh 33 organic matter as an ideal

585
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,798
amendment

586
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,319
so the scoop and dump technique has had

587
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,400
a legacy of practice on the cornell

588
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,759
campus for we're going on to year 14 now

589
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,280
at this point

590
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,038
every year in neenah basics creating the

591
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,359
urban eating class the this is a

592
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,279
year-long course and site establishment

593
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,079
of plants and woody plant id

594
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,240
the the class will design create and

595
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,119
install a new garden

596
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,440
and

597
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,678
we had been doing this technique for

598
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,600
more than 12 years when i started for 12

599
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,919
years when i started and it has been

600
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,439
used to restore sites such as some

601
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,880
people will recognize this this is

602
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,720
outside of mann library when it was

603
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,640
under construction

604
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,640
and severely impacted soils

605
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,000
were

606
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,079
occurred during this process

607
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,839
and here's a picture taken even a couple

608
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,678
years ago of what the landscape looks

609
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,839
like now

610
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,600
and another one so we we had seen that

611
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,839
anecdotally we knew it was working we

612
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,678
had some some research to back it up but

613
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,359
we wanted to take it another step

614
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,759
further and really see what the changes

615
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,959
in soil quality had occurred

616
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:17,919
based on using this technique

617
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,038
so in the first part of our study

618
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,880
we selected six sites representing 12

619
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,798
years

620
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,880
to be studied for our in our scoop and

621
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,319
dump soils and we selected four sites

622
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,000
that were in close proximity to our

623
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,480
study sites that had gone through

624
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,119
similar disturbance regimes

625
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,759
and could be used as a control or as a

626
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,759
contrast

627
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,038
and we used the soil health test to look

628
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,600
at physical biological

629
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:48,319
and chemical aspects of the soil in our

630
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,319
initial study

631
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,519
and the way we sampled is we would we

632
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,279
would dig into our scoop and dump soil

633
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,679
and we would sample that and then we'd

634
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,279
go below our scoop and dump layer

635
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,120
into our subsoil

636
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,000
and we'd also sample that and then for

637
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:06,319
our controls at we would take samples at

638
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,359
equal depths to our scoop and dump as

639
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,359
well as our subsoils

640
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,880
so looking at

641
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,720
soil resistance so coming in with a with

642
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,799
a calibrated penetrometer and doing it

643
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,360
all shortly after rainfall so very close

644
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,759
to field capacity for soil moisture

645
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,798
we saw that in our scoop and dump soils

646
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:29,279
that we started to see root limiting psi

647
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,839
or root limiting resistance i should say

648
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,399
in our scoop and dump soil right around

649
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,959
25 centimeters in depth

650
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,960
compared to our unamended soils we found

651
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,840
them right around nine centimeters in

652
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,519
depth so about a three-fold increase in

653
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,399
available root

654
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,879
depth

655
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,559
that we are finding in our remediated

656
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,919
sites

657
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,319
as i mentioned we look at this study in

658
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,759
two ways we looked at it in a

659
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,439
compare and contrast with our

660
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,960
unremediated to our immediate sites we

661
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,519
also looked at it over time since we've

662
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,440
been doing this practice for years

663
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,639
and over time we saw that

664
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,159
bulk density decreased over time

665
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,240
with your zero being over here

666
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,679
we also noticed that our or we found

667
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,038
that our potentially mineralizable

668
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,640
nitrogen

669
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,640
had increased over time

670
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,120
as well as our active carbon

671
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,879
and this was exciting to see and

672
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,319
certainly make sense with the

673
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,080
potentially mineralizable nitrogen

674
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,720
active carbon active carbon being a food

675
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:29,519
source for soil microorganisms

676
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,440
and

677
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,798
organisms that are involved in nitrogen

678
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,038
mineralization with the potentially

679
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:39,679
mineralizable nitrogen increases we see

680
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,279
and the the aggregate or sorry the bulk

681
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,519
density increase was also exciting to

682
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,519
see particularly with our increase in

683
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,558
aggregate stability we were saying that

684
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,879
we were

685
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,639
creating lower bulk density soils but

686
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,480
they were also being maintained by this

687
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,960
improvement in structure improvement in

688
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,480
pore space

689
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,400
so to summarize the other findings we

690
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,640
found from this initial study

691
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,000
we found also increased aggregate

692
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,000
stability

693
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,759
we found increased available water

694
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,480
holding capacity

695
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,919
increased total organic matter

696
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,278
increased potentially mineralizable

697
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,720
nitrogen

698
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,480
bulk densities

699
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,000
as well as active carbon

700
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,839
and this is kind of a common scene of

701
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
what we would find in many of our sites

702
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,158
this site had only been installed one

703
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,759
year when we looked at it but this is a

704
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,240
profile difference between our scoop and

705
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,599
dump soils compared to the subsoil and

706
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,359
you can see you know we found this all

707
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,119
across the site that once we get down to

708
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,199
that subsoil which had higher bulk

709
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,879
densities typically we would see the

710
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,000
roots just start to move sideways

711
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,840
instead of continuing to move down

712
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,880
so we took all this information and we

713
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:42,399
wanted to

714
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,000
think about how plants were grown in

715
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,919
this type of environment and do a study

716
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
to follow up what we learned in our

717
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,000
first section

718
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,200
so with that we came up with a soil

719
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,919
container study we wanted to conduct

720
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,679
to look at how the plants

721
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,799
how plants themselves would respond to

722
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,600
these different soil mediums

723
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,319
so

724
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,240
we

725
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,759
hypothesize that plants grown in the

726
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,319
scoop and dump soil

727
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,879
will have increased biomass and this

728
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,038
increased biomass will be correlated

729
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,799
with our reduced bulk density our

730
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,158
improved bulk density

731
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:17,679
and then we also hypothesized that

732
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,760
because of our increased water holding

733
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,480
capacity the plants growing in our scoop

734
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:25,599
and dump soil would have a

735
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,798
better capability of of dealing with

736
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,719
drought

737
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:32,000
particularly in stone model conductance

738
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,120
as well as photosynthesis

739
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,038
compared to our unamended soils

740
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,719
so we took a subset

741
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,400
of the sites we used before we selected

742
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,000
three sites

743
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,080
and we selected three controls that went

744
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,679
along with them and we went out into the

745
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,240
landscape

746
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,278
and we took large pvc cores

747
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,519
and

748
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,359
and in in this case we used a how to use

749
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,879
a backhoe to drive these into the ground

750
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,719
and pull them up

751
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,799
and this is the best available technique

752
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,759
we have getting as close to undisturbed

753
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,679
soil samples as as possible

754
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,119
perhaps a slight over estimate but it's

755
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,720
the best we work with

756
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,399
we didn't have to use a backhoe in our

757
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,759
scoop and dump sites because the bulk

758
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,600
density was decreased so it's a little

759
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:15,119
easier to sample

760
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:18,319
and so we selected a woody plant to

761
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,000
grow in them we selected ficus benjamina

762
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,918
and we wanted to use we ended up using

763
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,839
ficus bender mono one because it's known

764
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,000
in tropical regions of the world for

765
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:29,519
being a street tree

766
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,278
as we can see in this picture here

767
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,119
and we also want to use it to get around

768
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,359
the winter dormancy issue if we had

769
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,278
selected a north american temperate

770
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,278
species which would have been ideal but

771
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,759
we were working over the winter so

772
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:44,319
so we selected ficus benjamin evergreen

773
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,000
and had tissue cultured plants donated

774
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,399
to us from

775
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,159
sunshine horticulture in florida

776
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,440
all very pretty consistent size when we

777
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,080
got them

778
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,360
so we collected these soils outside we

779
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,720
brought them into the greenhouse for a

780
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,719
short period

781
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,200
and planted the ficus directly into the

782
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,720
different types of soils

783
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,600
and shortly after that we moved them

784
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,200
into growth chambers

785
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,918
and allowed them to grow for three and a

786
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,080
half months before we decided to conduct

787
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,240
our drought study

788
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,720
in the end we ended up using 15 soils

789
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,839
that had been remediated and 15 soils

790
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,880
that

791
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,278
had been remediated of the scoop and

792
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,679
dump in 15 that had not been remediated

793
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:27,759
for our study and we subjected them to a

794
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,759
period of 26 days of drought

795
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,359
and before we started the study what we

796
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,480
did is we got the plants up to field

797
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:36,879
capacity so we brought them up to a high

798
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,759
point of water holding and then let them

799
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,520
drain and then wrap them in bags so that

800
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,599
really all the only water that would be

801
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,400
lost is through transpiration and not

802
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,399
evaporation

803
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,000
so our measurements that we wanted to

804
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,360
look at in the study were root and shoot

805
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,119
biomass

806
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,079
total leaf area

807
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,239
and leaf water potential at pre-dawn

808
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,319
and the the soils characteristics that

809
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,359
we wanted to look at were gravimetric

810
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,398
water content volumetric water content

811
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,678
and texture water holding capacity total

812
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,000
organic matter

813
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,399
and bulk density

814
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,839
in terms of gas exchange we looked at

815
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:17,759
photosynthesis

816
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:19,839
as well as stone model conductance

817
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,798
so what we ended up finding from our

818
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,038
study

819
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:25,918
was that our leaf area in our scoop and

820
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,919
dump soils over here was was greatly

821
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,520
increased now almost

822
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:34,880
two-fold compared to our unamended soils

823
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,879
so much more leaf area

824
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,398
we found that our root dry weight was

825
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,480
significantly increased in our scoop and

826
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:45,479
dump soils compared to our unamended

827
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,480
soils

828
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,919
as well as our shoot dry weight was

829
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,919
significantly higher in our scoop and

830
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,320
dump soils compared to our unamended

831
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,320
soils

832
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,559
we also looked at bulk density

833
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,599
since this has been a major question of

834
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:01,278
our study

835
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,398
and we found that in our scoop and dump

836
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:04,000
soils

837
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:05,439
they were significantly lower than our

838
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,960
unamended

839
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,278
and for folks that aren't familiar bulk

840
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,759
density bulk density is a measurement of

841
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,519
weight over volume so grams per

842
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,640
centimeter cubed

843
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,240
and

844
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,919
a study done by data on warrington had

845
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,759
established a relationship between

846
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,919
different textural classes and root

847
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,759
limiting bulk densities and what they

848
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,038
found is that for your sands you can get

849
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:31,359
up to bulk density is around 1.75 grams

850
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,278
per centimeters cubed before you end up

851
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,240
finding reduced bulk densities and for

852
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,519
silts and clays it's around 1.4

853
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,079
so considering

854
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,480
again that our scoop and dump soils were

855
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:45,678
well below this 1.4 threshold was very

856
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,440
good to see and then our unamended soils

857
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,600
are definitely getting into the range of

858
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,120
root limiting bulk densities and we

859
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,158
don't have the textures back from our

860
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,519
study yet

861
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,480
but we'll be able to look at those

862
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:59,519
compared to these once those final tests

863
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,519
are completed

864
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,360
so we did our linear regression looking

865
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,038
at our dry weight shoots with our bulk

866
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,439
densities and we see a clear

867
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:11,679
relationship here

868
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,600
and if we overlay this with our

869
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,159
different types of treatments our scoop

870
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,240
and dump soils on the left here

871
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,480
and our are unamended we see a clear

872
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,278
relationship between the bulk density

873
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,200
and

874
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,038
this improved scoop and dump creating

875
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,798
allowing for more shoots to be grown and

876
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:28,079
this line here represents root limiting

877
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,079
bulk density

878
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,439
really strikingly

879
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,918
kind of cutting them right down the

880
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,240
middle there

881
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,559
so we saw this relationship as well with

882
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,278
our roots

883
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:43,678
here's with the overlay again

884
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,200
and we also saw this relationship

885
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,840
with our

886
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,840
leaf area

887
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:53,038
and again with this overlay

888
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,519
and so when we destructively harvested

889
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,359
these we obviously noticed certainly a

890
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,519
much larger volume of roots in our scoop

891
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,959
and dump comparatively to our unamended

892
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,720
soils

893
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,319
but one pattern that was very consistent

894
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,720
here are pictures from our unamended

895
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,879
sites was you can see from how i'm

896
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,440
holding up these roots right here

897
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,799
is that in our unamended soils

898
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,399
right here is kind of where we we

899
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,398
planted where the plug was that we

900
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:17,839
planted into the soils themselves and a

901
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,079
very consistent pattern where the roots

902
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,918
growing up across the top and then

903
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,918
escaping down the sides of the

904
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,840
containers right down here in an area

905
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,080
that had perhaps a little extra space in

906
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,240
it or did not have the same type of bulk

907
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,798
density as we found in the soil so this

908
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,200
was a very very consistent pattern and

909
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:38,079
um one that's interesting to think about

910
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,960
as we you know if we since we did this

911
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:42,240
in containers in the landscape roots

912
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,919
probably wouldn't have this they

913
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,519
certainly wouldn't have this container a

914
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,519
reduced area where they'd be able to go

915
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,839
down so we actually think that our roots

916
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:54,319
are a bit of an overestimate compared to

917
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,639
our scoop and dump

918
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,240
it was also very interesting to look at

919
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,559
the root exploration in our scoop and

920
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,960
dump soils we really saw that our roots

921
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,480
were really exploring and taking

922
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,558
advantage of this increased structure

923
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,120
with our aggregate stability

924
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,639
and able to find those poor spaces and

925
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,239
really work their way through and it was

926
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,600
interesting pulling them apart because

927
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,599
it would take a lot more work to break

928
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,519
up the aggregates and actually

929
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,079
free the roots from the system

930
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,278
compared to in our unamended soils where

931
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,038
pretty much you'd start to break it

932
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:24,720
apart and the soils would just all fall

933
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:25,919
away the plant was not holding very much

934
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,839
onto them

935
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,919
because of this decrease in structure

936
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,398
and root exploration throughout the

937
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,399
soils

938
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,639
so looking at our leaf water potentials

939
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,679
this is days of drought on the bottom

940
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,360
here

941
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,919
we see that

942
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:46,079
as in both the unamended and the scoop

943
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,679
and dump soils that that really there

944
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,000
wasn't much different in how these

945
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,080
plants were responding to drought in

946
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,319
terms of leaf water potentials and we

947
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,519
certainly saw a strong spike after day

948
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:57,519
16

949
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,759
of our potential starting to get really

950
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,839
negative at this point

951
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,079
and this was a fairly consistent pattern

952
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,678
that we saw with our photosynthetic rate

953
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,558
and our gas exchange measurements as

954
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,320
well

955
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,720
where both the plants there was no

956
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,639
significant differences in over the

957
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,640
course of the dry down experiment

958
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,880
showing a difference in photosynthetic

959
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,880
rate

960
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,518
as well as

961
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,720
stone model conductance

962
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,480
was also

963
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,720
had no significant differences between

964
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,240
the two

965
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,440
and

966
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,120
we started to think about this and look

967
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,278
at this we also looked at like i said

968
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,319
water loss of the soils themselves over

969
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,398
time

970
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,480
and the red up here is scoop and dump

971
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:41,199
soils and the blue is unamended and this

972
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,038
is a cumulative water loss over time

973
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,038
and with this what we see is that uh the

974
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,278
scuba dump soils

975
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,960
did in fact hold and lose more water

976
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,440
compared to or unamended which was

977
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,360
cooperated with our available increase

978
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,960
in available water holding capacity

979
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:57,599
where we lost uh

980
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,840
0.098 kilograms of water over the course

981
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,599
of 26 days well about a little more than

982
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:05,038
half of that

983
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:08,319
in our unamended soils just 0.65

984
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:08,320
kilograms of water loss

985
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:16,159
and looking at our

986
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,838
water loss between days we also saw that

987
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:23,679
as there were significant differences

988
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:25,440
between days 1 and day 6 16 in terms of

989
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,440
amount of water loss between days with

990
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,760
our scoop and dump soils losing more

991
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,878
water compared to our unamended and then

992
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,520
that

993
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:36,878
that difference no longer occurs after

994
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:38,878
day 21 and day 26.

995
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,719
and so looking at all this it it starts

996
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,519
to make more sense that even though our

997
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,918
scoop and dump soils held more water and

998
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:48,320
we did see an increase in both root

999
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,960
growth as well as total leaf area that

1000
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,639
there was a increase in stomatal

1001
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,280
conductance and increasing in

1002
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,480
transpiration which really seemed to

1003
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,839
explain driving this pattern between our

1004
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,960
different soil amendments

1005
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,679
and

1006
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,358
with that i'd like to thank my committee

1007
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,960
and everyone else who's been a part of

1008
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:13,119
my research progress here as well as the

1009
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,280
morton arboretum and i'm happy to answer

1010
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,280
any questions

1011
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,960
i just wanted to make sure i was

1012
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,280
understanding i said it seemed to me

1013
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,679
like you had two types of comparisons in

1014
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,880
your um study of the scoop and up so so

1015
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,559
one was the

1016
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,400
unamended versus the scoop and done but

1017
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,559
then also the scoop and dumps against

1018
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,079
each other over time

1019
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:41,519
so so okay

1020
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,039
it was so quick that i didn't quite

1021
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,800
catch it so you saw

1022
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,320
increasing potentially mineralizable

1023
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,720
nitrogen and active carbon and

1024
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,359
decreasing bulk density the longer over

1025
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:54,399
time oh that's so interesting so

1026
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,759
um so what what do you make of that

1027
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,440
well i think the

1028
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,920
the bulk density certainly makes sense

1029
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,200
with with you know the previous work

1030
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,599
that kind of all had done in terms of

1031
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,279
loosening the soil and maintaining

1032
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,119
that that loose as well creating more

1033
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,960
pore space and

1034
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,039
it also you know thinking about the

1035
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,280
increased in aggregate stability

1036
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,279
once the soil had been loosened and

1037
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,200
aggregates are starting to form that

1038
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,640
increase in structure

1039
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,078
certainly makes sense in terms of

1040
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,239
holding more horse space between the

1041
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,280
different aggregates and creating a less

1042
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,559
bulk

1043
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,839
environment in terms of the

1044
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,039
active carbon

1045
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:30,880
i think that was trying to make sense

1046
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,199
with the huge amount of organic matter

1047
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,200
that we input initially as well as the

1048
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,199
continuum

1049
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,400
or more

1050
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,920
preferential for microbes to live so

1051
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,720
over time as we continue to add more

1052
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,720
organic matter

1053
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,240
so it kind of seems like that initial

1054
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,599
remediation like sets of motion kind of

1055
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,199
a virtuous cycle like once you have

1056
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,680
better aggregation it can

1057
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,279
sequester more carbon

1058
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,118
yeah oh cause i mean i would expect the

1059
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,720
immediate difference between the two

1060
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,079
treatments but that increase over time

1061
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,759
is very interesting well that's

1062
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,400
something that you do tend to see also

1063
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,320
in

1064
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,400
like i mentioned the study that brian

1065
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,920
and chairman before we looked at time

1066
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,280
since disturbance

1067
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,559
that um

1068
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,680
after

1069
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,960
uh

1070
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:24,879
around 25 years you start to see

1071
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,599
soils start to cycle back and have a

1072
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,838
natural adaptive cycle so even without

1073
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,599
doing too much to your landscape you end

1074
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,239
up with

1075
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,240
soils without having to you know drink

1076
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:37,239
something

1077
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,519
um i have a question about the

1078
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,679
that same part of your study so

1079
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,440
did you have the same species in all

1080
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,519
these landscapes so clearly your plant

1081
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,440
material would affect your soil

1082
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,119
characteristics as well particularly if

1083
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,639
that landscape has been established for

1084
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,720
some period of time so were you always

1085
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,960
sampling near the same species or in an

1086
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,759
area with no plants or how did that work

1087
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,559
we totally

1088
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,720
we ran transects through our plots and

1089
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,639
then went at certain intervals to reach

1090
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:14,239
one so we weren't as conscious of

1091
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,239
looking at individual species

1092
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,359
this first study was more of just a

1093
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,358
survey to look at what you know really

1094
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,358
what the changes in storm quality have

1095
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,199
been and so looking at it in a more

1096
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:28,480
efficient comment you know

1097
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,879
13 14 years ago retrospectively

1098
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,599
every year

1099
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,320
one single species and all of that

1100
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,160
but

1101
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,519
we we didn't do that so we didn't quite

1102
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,118
have enough and that was something that

1103
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:40,320
we didn't think about trying to look at

1104
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,838
in terms of

1105
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,599
looking at some of the plant responses

1106
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:45,440
since they all received received very

1107
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,280
similar management over the years but we

1108
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,519
couldn't find any selections that were

1109
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,200
the same because part of the reason we

1110
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:53,599
create these last tips is to create

1111
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,598
diverse

1112
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,639
learning opportunities for students in

1113
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,838
the class

1114
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,759
so

1115
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,440
you know and maybe a more traditional

1116
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,880
context of what we have on the point we

1117
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,559
could be better same species that we

1118
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,119
find in our

1119
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,199
in our kind of normal landscapes outside

1120
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,200
of

1121
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:18,239
uh the things in the dump soil had

1122
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:21,679
higher transpiration rates and larger

1123
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:23,358
leaves why wasn't the water potential

1124
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:27,118
lower

1125
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:29,598
and why wasn't photosynthesis low

1126
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,160
you're drawing more water on tan yeah i

1127
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,160
mean for

1128
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,039
you know well i think it makes sense if

1129
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,559
we think about the total beef area

1130
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,639
in terms of stomatal conductance at

1131
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:43,039
least we had greater leaf area in our

1132
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:46,000
scuba dub soils almost twice as much so

1133
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,599
that was driving transpiration

1134
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,599
what should have blown off more water

1135
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,400
and make the soil drier

1136
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,800
right

1137
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,079
but okay so our oil but our soils had

1138
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,160
more

1139
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,480
even so even though they had more meat

1140
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:01,279
area um we had higher water holding

1141
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,119
capacities in our dumb soils

1142
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,119
so

1143
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,119
yeah

1144
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,200
so i had a question on a totally

1145
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,039
different topic that you also touched on

1146
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,838
so you talked about the importance of

1147
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:20,000
volunteers in the botanical gardens

1148
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,320
research and i'm really interested to

1149
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,119
know what you think about um

1150
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,039
if and how um the principal

1151
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,440
investigators in context like that can

1152
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,639
create a valuable kind of educational

1153
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,000
and or professional development

1154
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,838
experience for those volunteers for

1155
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,719
those volunteers i mean i can see how it

1156
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:36,480
could be

1157
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:37,279
you know very much a kind of front work

1158
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,639
thing

1159
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,160
where you don't get much out of it but i

1160
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,559
can also see how you could shape it to

1161
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,159
be something really transformative yeah

1162
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:45,440
and that was interesting about brian's

1163
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,199
lab in particular because of all the

1164
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,440
labs at the morning routine he took

1165
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,358
advantage of volunteers like everybody

1166
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,358
else and the type of people that

1167
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:54,239
volunteered were really across the board

1168
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,559
from

1169
00:40:54,239 --> 00:41:00,399
um you know like he got his kids in

1170
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,400
there maybe they didn't volunteer

1171
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,519
from from people who are in you know

1172
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:11,598
college looking to gain experience too

1173
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:13,039
you know he had retired chemists in this

1174
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,559
lab

1175
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,239
and just wanted to do you know do

1176
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,599
something with their time and take their

1177
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,759
skill and put it to put it to use and so

1178
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:25,119
for him it's become a very effective

1179
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,720
tool and also he's

1180
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,960
he's been able to tap into a lot of

1181
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,078
resources and because of having these

1182
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,800
people with

1183
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,800
such depth of knowledge

1184
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,559
yeah i don't know exactly but it's it

1185
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,000
isn't it's a it's a you know at botanic

1186
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,639
gardens there's this kind of nutrition

1187
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,639
in the history of the fact

1188
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:55,440
you know i've tried to think about how

1189
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,280
to how to apply it into other contexts

1190
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,358
because potential articles are mission

1191
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,240
based organizations that people are used

1192
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:02,559
to

1193
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:04,479
and visiting and having a kind of

1194
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,519
experience that and it's a little

1195
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,440
different than what we see in the

1196
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,440
academics so it'd be great to see the

1197
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,440
campaign

1198
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:17,039
