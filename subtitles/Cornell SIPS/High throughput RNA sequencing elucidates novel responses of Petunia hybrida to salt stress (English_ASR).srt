1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,320
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:11,480
University uh so I'll be talking about

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,679
transcript analysis in between under

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,079
CEST stress today which is a big part of

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,000
my PhD and um I want to start off this

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,358
talk by introducing the problem with Sol

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,960
stress uh talking briefly about a

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,039
particular mechanism that plants uh use

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,800
to cope with uh with salinity

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,679
introducing you a great new model to

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
study Sal stress which is petunia

12
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,879
briefly talk about genomic in different

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,640
species uh and then briefly mention

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,480
about uh advantages of using RN

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,119
technology uh then I want to walk you

16
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:40,599
through the experimental design and I

17
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,359
want to spend most of the time talking

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,239
about the result which I broke down into

19
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,359
um RC without reference genome and

20
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,919
expanding results with a reference

21
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,479
genome so uh solid stress it is a big

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,359
problem worldwide there's no surprise

23
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,558
about that you can see in this map all

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,960
these red color uh that are pretty WID

25
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:02,358
spread throughout the world uh represent

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,280
5 gram of sodium chloride per per liter

27
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,920
which is equivalent to 90 Mill of sodium

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,759
chloride it's a pretty pretty big amount

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,159
of salt uh pretty wi Express wi spread

30
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,438
in the world um we also see that 20% of

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,479
the irrigation water is affected by

32
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,359
solid stress so uh why is this a problem

33
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,478
well salinity and drw stress are the

34
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,159
primary causes of crop loss worldwide

35
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,319
and sodium chloride actually it is what

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,359
disrupt the normal plant growth and

37
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,399
development this is a simple experiment

38
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,799
in which uh sodium chloride plant

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,079
treated with sodum chloride I can um

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,240
show this uh really phenotype

41
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,519
compared to the

42
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:40,078
control now um the longly there's a

43
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,879
really long list of detrimental

44
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,399
consequences of sodium chloride I'm just

45
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,438
mentioning a couple here uh there's a

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,519
big disrup in Mineral nutrition

47
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,279
specifically with potassium and there's

48
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:54,158
also a more in a cytosolic level uh

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,799
strong inhibition in in enzymes so when

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,640
I talk about sodium chloride at a

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,799
cellular level I basically mean uh when

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,799
in the cytool you find more than 100

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,039
Mill sodium chloride as opposed to uh

54
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,920
less than 10 Mill in the cytool but

55
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,080
luckily for us plant have developed

56
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,119
different mechanism to cope with cell

57
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,599
stress and um and there's again a really

58
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,360
long list of uh coping mechanism I'm

59
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:21,759
just showing you here five which is

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,480
restriction of Sal uptake Extrusion and

61
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:28,159
compatibilization uh controlling the

62
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:30,318
long distance of sodium um um for

63
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:34,239
stabilizing membranes and increase

64
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:36,280
osmotic potential just as a long list

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,200
now um so I brought this up because it's

66
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,560
an interesting uh cycle that uses uh one

67
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,719
or more of this coping mechanism so

68
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,158
sodium chloride in high concentrations

69
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,840
can be perceived by unknown receptors

70
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:51,280
which trigger the elevation of a

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,360
cytosolic calcium a secondary messenger

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,959
that activates this protein receptor S3

73
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,239
which activates this kinas s to which is

74
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,319
pretty much uh the kinas that does a lot

75
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,200
of the work work in this mechanism by

76
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,958
phosphor this plasma uh this transpor

77
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,439
here in the plasma membrane which

78
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,719
actually extrude calcium pump sodium out

79
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:15,439
of the cytosol uh this kindness so to as

80
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:18,759
well um um can control the expression of

81
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,759
NAX which is a tonoplast uh transported

82
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,639
the pump sodium into the vacle which

83
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,679
will correspond to compar

84
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,719
mization um one of the ways in which

85
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,920
sodium gets in the cytool in the first

86
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,400
place is by utilizing low affinity

87
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,318
potassium transported that you guys can

88
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,158
see uh down here and uh there's a big

89
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,560
unknown and there's a lot of research

90
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:42,239
going on as um to figure out how this

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,120
complex SO2 SO3 um can downregulate and

92
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,400
stop the stop this uh low Affinity

93
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,080
potassium transporter uh and again

94
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,239
there's a lot of unknowns we don't know

95
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,840
how this uh complex interacts with the

96
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,519
high Affinity potassium transporter um

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,719
so this of course pathway has been

98
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,319
figured out in

99
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,400
arabidopsis most of the study that we we

100
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:03,399
not today in solid stress as comfor

101
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,120
opsis which is a great model for a lot

102
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,879
of things but not really for solid

103
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,799
stress so we are actually suggesting

104
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:12,639
that uh we should shift a little bit the

105
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,719
pattern uh with the AR abdes to petunia

106
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,798
and why do we say this because petunia

107
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,279
under Sol stress uh it really deals

108
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,239
pretty well with Sal stress um 1% of of

109
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,319
sodium ions by dry weight it is um it

110
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,160
can accumulates 1% of its weight in

111
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:31,680
sodium um now we did this uh experiment

112
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,160
in 2011 where we screen the ability of

113
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,600
of 14 species to withstand sodium

114
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
chloride and we group them in four in

115
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,199
four Big groups the most tolerant

116
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,160
species are somewhat tolerant sensitive

117
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,800
and extremely sensitive and you can see

118
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,000
that petunia actually ranked in the most

119
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,000
tolerant um in the most tolerant um

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
upper level now um when you grow

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,639
petunias um under 60 40 20 Mill sodium

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,038
chloride the really the growth um and

123
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,240
the phenotype is not really affected um

124
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,918
you see some detrimental consequences at

125
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,360
80 MIM not really affected in flowering

126
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,758
but just returing the growth so we think

127
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,080
that petunia uh can offer a really good

128
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,120
U can be a really good model to further

129
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:19,519
study uh sodium the effect of sodium

130
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,720
chloride so petunia it is uh is one of

131
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,478
the member of the solania family which

132
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,560
is a pretty many of these Solon species

133
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,758
are great for genetics and biochemical

134
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,319
uh studies this is a these are the par

135
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,600
of petunia hyria axillaris and inflata

136
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,840
and I'm going to talk about this later

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,400
on later today and then we have the

138
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,599
distance related

139
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:41,599
tomato now when we think about petunia

140
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
as a model species uh the first thing

141
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,720
that we actually think about is that it

142
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,840
is a really good model for transposons

143
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,680
almost as good model as maze for

144
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,959
transpose of elements uh there's a lot

145
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,160
of cogenetic analysis it is a great

146
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:58,318
model for uh pigmentation of floral sand

147
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,800
and for vs but um but we're pushing now

148
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,199
petunia as a model as well for solid

149
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,598
stress now what has been done in terms

150
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,240
of solid stress in this family well uh

151
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:11,560
unfortunately there hasn't been a lot of

152
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,598
research conducted uh with the solania

153
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,280
family the most thorough study that uh

154
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:19,560
was published in 2007 was a microway in

155
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,439
tomato where uh they screamed two

156
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,439
accession of tomato this one up here uh

157
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:28,959
they stress the plant with 150 M sodium

158
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,719
chloride and they uh all uh sample Roots

159
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,680
they mic

160
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,000
using the micro rates they uh they were

161
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,840
able to identify roughly 100 ests that

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,160
were uh differentially expressed at 30

163
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:44,879
minutes of sodium chloride exposure uh

164
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,599
700 ests at 2 hours and 1,000 ests uh at

165
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,719
6 hours uh they were able to group all

166
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:52,639
these ests into different group using

167
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,000
genology uh such as energy metabolism

168
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,120
Etc now this was a great approach

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,839
because it really changed uh the way

170
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,000
that we approach the study of soral

171
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,439
chloride look single Gene single Pathway

172
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,598
to a more Global holistic uh point of

173
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,680
view so um so we're doing something

174
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:11,038
similar in fact uh the only difference

175
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,560
is that we're not we're not using uh

176
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,439
we're not using these chips anymore

177
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,240
we're actually using an RNC approach and

178
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,399
the reason that we decided to do it this

179
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,079
way is because um micro Ray were great

180
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,198
Technologies in the early 2000s uh

181
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,439
however they are relatively low throw

182
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,520
put they really depend on sequencing of

183
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:33,160
cdna and est's libraries um they can be

184
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:35,038
expensive and not quanti quantitative

185
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,080
they uh they do have a false positive

186
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,839
through cross hybridization and they

187
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,878
have a really small dynamic range that

188
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:43,119
is to say transcript that are uh low low

189
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,158
transcript transcript that are

190
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,720
transcribed really low and really high

191
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:49,478
um they're not going to be uh picked by

192
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,199
the micro so instead we decided to use a

193
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:54,360
more novel technique RNA which is a

194
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,560
really high throughput uh approach where

195
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,400
you can sequence millions of nucleotides

196
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,759
of DNA in a single run uh it is cheaper

197
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,158
compared to a microway it has a really

198
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,879
good dynamic range you you don't it has

199
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:08,759
more Sensi sensitivity than the microway

200
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,560
and it has a bar coverage so this is the

201
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,158
flow the flow as to how we we actually

202
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,280
do the library preparation but I'm not

203
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:17,439
going to go over that um and this is a

204
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,198
protocol developed by James janoni the

205
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,598
bti which I'll talk about in a few

206
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,360
minutes okay so what are the goals of

207
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,279
this uh project we um wanted to

208
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,080
characterize a transcriptional profile

209
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:33,120
of P hybrid and Sol stress 150 M and

210
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,918
control we wanted to develop a

211
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,560
transcriptional profile through a Time

212
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,478
course of gene expression and we aim as

213
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,359
well to understand how biological

214
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,919
processes changeed withell stress um for

215
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,639
the specific goals which I'm going to

216
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:50,720
get later today um we wanted to compare

217
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:52,278
using our NC platform um how hene

218
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,440
expression changes with and without

219
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:55,838
reference

220
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,640
genome um so how did we set up the

221
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,160
experiment we uh had 18 plants growing

222
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,799
hydroponic Al in a growth chamber which

223
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:05,399
were randomly divided into two groups uh

224
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:07,679
these are nine plants corresponding to

225
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,919
control which I color coded with dark

226
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,439
green and nine plants uh corresponding

227
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,159
to the the treated plants with 150

228
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,680
millimolar now uh when you do R and when

229
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,719
you do basically any type of science it

230
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,559
is really good to do biorbs um and

231
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,440
that's what we did we uh pull one leaf

232
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:26,159
from three plants will become one bior

233
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,240
replicate U so we have rep one rep two

234
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:31,958
rep three and we will do this uh this

235
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,680
time Point 06 and 24 hours after solid

236
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:37,199
stress uh and we would do it at both uh

237
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:40,078
at both control and treatment to control

238
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,480
for circadian genes or genes that are uh

239
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:43,399
mechanically induced that we're not

240
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,399
really interested in looking so we did

241
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,039
this for roots uh for roots for leaves

242
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,759
and this as it is it is a pretty big

243
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:53,360
experiment a lot of RNA to extract from

244
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,639
different tissues so we decided to focus

245
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,759
uh on leaves to begin with and we left

246
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:01,199
uh roots for later on so uh we did all

247
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:04,600
the leaves at the beginning and uh at

248
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,320
these three time points 60 and 24 and as

249
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,759
I said at the beginning we use this

250
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,040
protocol developed by bti by janonis

251
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,679
group where we struct total RNA with the

252
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:16,719
trial method we capture messenger RNA

253
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:19,278
with Magnetic bits which we reverse

254
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,000
transcribe to cdna and then at this

255
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,559
stage of the cdna stage we index the

256
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,360
library with a six uh with a barcode six

257
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:30,000
nucleotide barcode with hplc primers

258
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,519
which would give us an indexed Li

259
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,440
so uh so this is the way that the

260
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,679
protocol works this is an already

261
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,360
optimized protocol now as we were doing

262
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:41,599
this we realized that ordering o hlc

263
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,000
primers it was quite expensive so we

264
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,600
said well what happens if we indexes

265
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,440
libraries with non hplc primers so um so

266
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,399
in this case for example we have these

267
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,360
two indexed libraries one of them uh

268
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,360
with this set of primer one of this with

269
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,519
this set of primer all of them coming

270
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,079
from the same pool of r&amp; name right so

271
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,519
they would be virually the same except

272
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,759
for the code the six nucleotide code and

273
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,278
we did this little side experiment with

274
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:11,679
all the leaves to optimize this protocol

275
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:14,120
um by assessing if hlc versus no hlc

276
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,679
would have an effect in uh Library

277
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,440
preparation why do we bother to do that

278
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,278
well because if if they actually the

279
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,120
same we can treat these libraries as

280
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:24,320
technical replicate increasing the depth

281
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,000
of our experiment and of course if we

282
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,120
prove that this doesn't really affect

283
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,958
the data uh it's a big Advantage for

284
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,679
future RN experiment um so we uh we did

285
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,799
this for all the libraries all the Le

286
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,159
libraries from the three time points uh

287
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,799
generating 30 libraries corresponding to

288
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:43,919
both uh Technical and uh biological

289
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:47,078
replicates we pair in sequence in a

290
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:49,919
single Lane to uh rule out any Lan

291
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:52,879
primary effect in a high 2000 and we

292
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:56,599
generated 196 million

293
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:59,720
reads so um so how do we how do we go

294
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,480
about to uh how do we go about to do r

295
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,680
with all this 196 million r that we just

296
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,159
generated with the illumin high so the

297
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:10,239
first question that we asked was uh

298
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:12,879
regarding to the hlc or hlc primers was

299
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,799
okay are those sample the same uh if

300
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,679
they were not then we would just discard

301
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,838
n h PLC samples and we will proceed the

302
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,359
without them now in our case and I'll

303
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,800
show you that actually doesn't really

304
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,120
matter we uh they were the same so we

305
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,879
proceed to Dem Multiplex uh and we

306
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,198
process we got rid of the illumin

307
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:33,480
adapters we increased the Q value of the

308
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:36,319
RS Etc and then we work with this uh

309
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,920
clean basically clean rits now the

310
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,120
second question that we had to ask is

311
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,639
well do we have a reference genome that

312
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,519
we can align all the short reads against

313
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,320
so uh if you have a reference genome

314
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,959
that great you just can proceed to map

315
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,079
and then look for Gen expression if you

316
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,159
don't have you need to assemble generate

317
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,838
a consensus and then you go back to

318
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:57,159
mapping uh once you map you generate a

319
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,040
bom file and then you can uh count

320
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,000
basically reads which is the basics of

321
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,679
RNA cic and gene expression and I'm

322
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,839
going to get to this part later on um so

323
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,519
going back to this first question uh are

324
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,040
these samples the same or

325
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,240
not so it turns out that it doesn't

326
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,879
really matter whether you use hlc or non

327
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,839
hlc primers uh so this is a hit map of

328
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,240
differentially expressed genes in which

329
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,880
we're looking at how the sample claster

330
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,919
together so we're basically comparing

331
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:27,399
the biological replicates R1 R2 R3

332
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:31,000
versus the technical replicates NH and

333
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:33,240
hlc and you see that all the distance

334
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,679
between the distance between the

335
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,600
technical replicates HP and N NH it is

336
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,958
uh smaller than biological reps so I'm

337
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,278
just going to assume I'm just going to

338
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,479
assume into uh this heat map to show you

339
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,480
that unfortunately this is uh so this

340
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:53,159
says R2 so all the technical replicates

341
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,159
HP NH H NH h HP are more closely related

342
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,078
uh than the biological replicates so

343
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:59,679
this and you see this across all the

344
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:01,198
samples so this was a great indic a that

345
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,159
really uh it doesn't really matter

346
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:07,599
whether you use hplc no hplc now the

347
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:09,958
final uh and most strong evidence uh to

348
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,240
argue that you can use non H PLC primer

349
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:14,518
it came from the statistical analysis

350
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,680
where we run a multiple analysis of

351
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,600
variance between these two uh data set

352
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,958
um and in our in our statistical model

353
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,000
we include primary type hlc on hlc time

354
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:28,239
points 0 6 and 24 and interaction of

355
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,078
those and we looked at the cut off of

356
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,320
the most Express transcript at 10

357
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:38,319
100,000 10,000 and 100,000

358
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,720
rpkm um and here I'm just showing you U

359
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,120
the output for uh the expression profile

360
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,519
of the top 10 most expressed transcript

361
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,039
and you can see that both treatment and

362
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,879
time points are significant as well as

363
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,240
the interaction of treatment and time

364
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,278
point but primary themselves they

365
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,959
actually they're not significant so with

366
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,600
this data we were able to conclude um

367
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,799
that um we can and we should treat our

368
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,120
libraries our non hlc and hlc as

369
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,679
technical replicates and it has the

370
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,120
great impact uh that can uh by

371
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:10,278
decreasing the cost of Library

372
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,278
preparation for future ironistic

373
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:14,519
experiment um so great that was a but

374
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,879
that wasn't my research that was a

375
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,959
little site project that we had going on

376
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,360
the real research it was to do RN with

377
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,198
petunia under cess and the question then

378
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,600
becomes how do we um how do we attract

379
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:29,519
biological information from these

380
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,839
reads and uh the first problem that I

381
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,639
had is that there's already 60 PL

382
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,480
genomes sequence and available uh these

383
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:39,680
are just some of them arabidopsis L Pana

384
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,800
of course models we have maze over here

385
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:45,799
there's a couple of solanas uh tomato

386
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:48,078
and potato but there's no petunia so in

387
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:49,758
the era of next generational sequencing

388
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,239
you have to have a reference to align

389
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,600
your RIS so how do you how do you go

390
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,360
about if you don't have a reference um

391
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,120
so it turns out that there is a way

392
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,800
there is a way to do this

393
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,399
which is by generating a transcripton by

394
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:05,838
the noo assembling all the millions of

395
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,159
uh rits that you generated with the

396
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,959
Luminous sequencing into one final

397
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,439
transcriptor this is of course a very

398
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:16,599
simplified uh example but um and then we

399
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,759
would we would basically treat this um

400
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,079
we will basically treat this

401
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,079
transcripton as if it was a genome right

402
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,919
it is not a genome but we will use it in

403
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:27,519
in the same way uh to map so how do we

404
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,278
do this step there's different type of

405
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,759
assemblers nowaday that can allow you to

406
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:34,919
do this uh the first three assembler

407
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,680
Myra GS assembler and I assembler they

408
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:40,318
uh they basically rely on overlapping

409
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,239
DNA sequences and looking for consensus

410
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:44,879
and they are actually more suitable when

411
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,399
you have long reads um for my experiment

412
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,480
I had short rates of DNA um I so then we

413
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,759
would look at these four assemblers down

414
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,199
here trans Adis soap belet and Trinity

415
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,440
which they don't really rely in this

416
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,559
overlapping consensus sequences they

417
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,839
rely on really complete Le mathematical

418
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:04,759
algorithm based on the Brin graph um to

419
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,600
to generate a

420
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:10,679
transcriptor so um the way we did this

421
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,119
is that we chose the three of the uh

422
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,919
most the newest assembler Trinity soap

423
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,519
and trans abis and we generated three

424
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,480
independent transcripts and we would

425
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:23,240
evaluate which of these transcripton

426
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,199
would give us uh would be the best and

427
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,079
and use that transcriptor for Downstream

428
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:31,360
analysis so um so here we're looking at

429
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:34,079
the comparison of the messenger RNA

430
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,719
length distribution of uh the different

431
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,399
transcript the different assemblers we

432
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,519
use compared with tomato so we didn't

433
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,480
plot transcript longer than 5,000 base

434
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,839
paars because otherwise this uh box body

435
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,079
would have been huge um and so here we

436
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:49,599
have the Tomato transcripton which uh we

437
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:52,000
know the medium size is roughly 1,000

438
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,678
base pairs for all for all the the

439
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,038
transcript and uh when using trim with

440
00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:01,360
Thea KR 25 we obtain a really close

441
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:04,440
distrib ution to Tomato which was closer

442
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:07,158
uh than uh any of these other three now

443
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,720
uh soap with KR 47 it was good it was

444
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,799
the second best uh getting close to

445
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,919
Tomato but it wasn't as good as Trinity

446
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,558
and uh soap with the default it wasn't

447
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,080
really it wasn't really good and trans

448
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:21,480
AIS uh was the worst uh it didn't really

449
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:24,558
recover most of the transcript so um so

450
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,200
it was great um and this allow us to uh

451
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,558
to see that Trinity it was the V the noo

452
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,400
assembler now we also looked at B

453
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,839
informatic parameters to make sure that

454
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,360
Trinity was indeed the best assembler um

455
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,158
and when we look at con Min size of all

456
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,439
the assemblers Trinity was by far the

457
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,679
best it was almost twice the countes

458
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,159
were almost twice as big as any others

459
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:49,080
of the assemblers we had a pretty big

460
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:50,880
l50 and uh we have a really low n50

461
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,480
which is basically an indication as to

462
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,919
how fraction have to uh how cut off the

463
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,400
transcription can be so the lower the

464
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:01,679
M50 the better um the only uh really uh

465
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,400
bizarre thing that we observed it was we

466
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,559
that we found we identified over 100,000

467
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,159
uniin uh with this denovo assembly and

468
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:10,720
that was really passina because we know

469
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,600
well at this stage we don't know how

470
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,720
many jeans petunia has but we know that

471
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:19,079
um tomato has roughly 35,000 so Pia

472
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,360
there's no way that pia has more more

473
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:24,240
than uh more twice as that unless there

474
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:26,599
crazy duplication Gene events which is

475
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,880
really unlikely um so this was

476
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:31,279
interesting and I'm going to get to that

477
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,880
in a in a couple of minutes but um

478
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,918
anyway we went ahead and we annotated

479
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,120
this transcripton that we developed

480
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,759
using blast to go um and blast to go

481
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,519
actually uses uh the ncbi database to do

482
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,440
all the blast and the notation it wasn't

483
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:48,038
really good and I spent a lot of time

484
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,600
trying to figure out why the notation

485
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:51,400
wasn't wasn't really good and then I

486
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,558
realized that well the Tomato genome is

487
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,280
actually not on ncbi so I was doing the

488
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:58,079
blast against all the other species

489
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,158
except tomato uh so then we reannotated

490
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,000
the the same transcripton against the

491
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:05,080
this is the sgn database is a database

492
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,798
exclusively for solanas that is run at

493
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:10,720
bti um so I reannotated using a blast X

494
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:13,639
against the sgn database and The

495
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,839
annotation was actually way better um so

496
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:20,840
we were able to annotate roughly 33,000

497
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:23,439
uni and uh this 32,000 map directly to

498
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:26,678
the coding region of tomato with an

499
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,840
average average size of roughly 1 KB we

500
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,038
identify a ribosomal approach a few uh

501
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,678
bacterial genes and the large majority

502
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:36,919
of the genes were unannotated uh we

503
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,759
think that they correspond to variable

504
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,480
five Prime and three prime UT regions uh

505
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,839
that are unique to petunia that are not

506
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,558
really conserved with tomato and um as

507
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,599
you might recall from the beginning u p

508
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,079
is a great model for transposons uh and

509
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:52,839
we think that we're actually uh

510
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,599
capturing a lot of that here now um we

511
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:58,158
need to keep in mind as well that um we

512
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,918
have this big number of unin and that's

513
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,080
because uh multiple un genes can

514
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,880
correspond to one gene so this is a

515
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,359
simple example in which we have a gene

516
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,200
with four exons and assuming that this

517
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:11,798
Gene um doesn't have any any isopor this

518
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,880
is the only isopor um we would see that

519
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:16,319
uh the same correlation of the exons in

520
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,840
the transcript and uh when we map we see

521
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:23,480
enough coverage uh of RS to that align

522
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:26,720
to xon one and two but we do not see uh

523
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,558
enough coverage from xon 2 to xon 3 uh

524
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,480
in the same from xon 3 xon 4 so

525
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:33,720
basically the software uh which is

526
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,599
pretty smart but it's not smart enough

527
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,960
um it is thinking that these are

528
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:41,158
actually three independent uh genes so

529
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,079
this also explain why we get a big

530
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:47,799
numbers now this big number uh it is um

531
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:50,158
it's been uh reported other people that

532
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:52,440
have done other denovo assembl in other

533
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,278
species in Chinese cabbage for example

534
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,880
find a similar number of unun which was

535
00:21:55,278 --> 00:22:01,359
surprising um so anyway we decided to

536
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,278
use use genology uh to assign function

537
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,639
to all these denovo assembly uh

538
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:08,079
transcript that we were able to annotate

539
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,799
and uh 50% when you look at the UN genes

540
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:13,639
distribution 50% of those um are related

541
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:17,119
with both metabolic and cellular

542
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,880
processes uh in 10 20% of the the

543
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,959
overall distribution correspond to

544
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,400
response to stimulus and biological

545
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,360
regulation now we uploaded this

546
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,440
transcripton this transcripton can be a

547
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:30,599
great tool for bi formatic purposes so

548
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,720
we decided to share this uh we uploaded

549
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:37,119
as a FTP file in the in the soul genomic

550
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,038
database and um after a few weeks that

551
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,158
we published this work we actually got a

552
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:43,319
lot of emails from people asking if we

553
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,240
could make this bastable so whatever

554
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:47,359
favorite gen that were working with they

555
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,000
could uh blast it again the transcripton

556
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,599
so we uh contact people at the sgn and

557
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,119
requested if they could do a blast B uh

558
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:57,399
so that was pretty cool um so this is uh

559
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,839
you can go now to the sgn to uh

560
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,759
transcript project uh this is our work

561
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,038
and you can uh type whatever uh partial

562
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,400
sequence that you have for your favorite

563
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,919
gen and see if you can uh retrieve more

564
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,159
of the gene itself or The annotation for

565
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,720
it um so this was pretty cool and but

566
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,960
again that wasn't the whole purpose of

567
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,079
the project the project it was to do R

568
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,400
to study Sal stress but we needed to go

569
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:25,119
through this denovo assembly to find or

570
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,400
to have all the players to do RN so now

571
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,558
we have we have a reference and we can

572
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,640
map

573
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:34,038
um we can map using this software B High

574
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,080
uh to um to look for gene expression

575
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:40,278
when you do this you generate a bomb

576
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:43,240
file um and then using RM You Can Count

577
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:46,839
normalize and uh look for RS per

578
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,599
kilobase of Exon of rib Maps which is uh

579
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:50,798
which is a measure basically of gene

580
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:53,439
expression uh and then using this

581
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,839
package in this bioconductor DC you can

582
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,360
look for differential expressed genes um

583
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:01,278
so in between these two things the rpkm

584
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,558
and the Dex you spend a lot of time

585
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:06,919
doing the data mining now why do we need

586
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:09,440
to data mine um so this is uh what you

587
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:11,799
get from using RM bioconductor it is a

588
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,960
pretty complex Matrix of numbers and

589
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:15,278
it's really hard to to make sense of it

590
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,798
you can see this is for example

591
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,440
corresponds to Leaf uh when there were

592
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:24,720
treated with salt under 24 hours you see

593
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,880
all the RPM values uh uh RCM is bound

594
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,839
with Trinity so you can identify genes

595
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,320
and different I I forms of the gene but

596
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,398
still this is not really intuitive uh

597
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:36,278
you can make you can make absolutely no

598
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:39,839
sense of this and this is what your data

599
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:41,880
mine now what type of uh data mine uh

600
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,798
method do you use well that really

601
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,600
depends on uh on the type of research

602
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:49,720
you're doing um for for our case making

603
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:53,000
sense of these 100,000 uni gen um we

604
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,558
decided to do look for anomaly detection

605
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,480
uh perform a geneontology analysis

606
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:00,639
cluster analysis and compar in compare

607
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,599
basically our data with uh with other

608
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,278
transcript analysis I'm just going to

609
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:07,199
talk briefly about these three today and

610
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,880
so when we look at anomaly detection you

611
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,919
have to remember that uh all these

612
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,960
sequences were coming from leaves right

613
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,919
we left the roots at the minus 80 at

614
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,360
this point um and this is uh when you do

615
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,880
leave leaves uh you basically would

616
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,519
expect that rubisco it uh it is the most

617
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,640
abundant enzyme in the world uh you

618
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,398
would expect that the expression of

619
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,440
rubisco is uh the highest in both Sal

620
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:30,639
treated and controlled leaves um and

621
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,640
this is and this is what we saw we

622
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,520
observed that the top 10 most expressed

623
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,360
genes in terms of RPM were all related

624
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,038
with the

625
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:41,918
photosynthesis uh in in fact rubisco it

626
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,720
was the highest now this data of course

627
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,200
uh is not really interesting it just

628
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,278
sort of to validate the RNA data you

629
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,519
don't do anything with this uh but it

630
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:51,000
let us know that we're on the right

631
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,679
track with the

632
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,359
analysis uh so with the genology

633
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,679
analysis we just aim to better

634
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,678
understand how biological process

635
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,880
processes are affected with solid stress

636
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:07,240
and um so as as I said before we U we

637
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,240
use genology to uh to assign function to

638
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,278
this transcript but the real question

639
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,159
that we were looking for it was how do

640
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,440
these biological processes change it

641
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:17,960
with sodium chloride so we perform a

642
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,440
statistical analys analysis Fisher test

643
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,319
of genology term differences where we

644
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,679
would look for the dexs uh of let's of

645
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:27,678
two time points control six cell six and

646
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,440
we will we will compare those against

647
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,679
our universe which is the transcripton

648
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,240
now there are different ways to uh talk

649
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:37,038
about and represent uh geneontology I

650
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,558
think that the work cloud is one of the

651
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,359
most uh simple ones to understand uh so

652
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:43,440
just keep in mind that all of these are

653
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,798
over represented go terms that have a

654
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,480
significant FDR that I'm not showing but

655
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,119
when we look at these two time points

656
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,919
control six and sell six we see that we

657
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:56,678
have abscisic acid and ethylin are one

658
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,440
of the most over represented go terms um

659
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:01,679
we also find kineses and G protein cople

660
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,960
receptors as the most over represented

661
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,519
good terms so all of this actually it

662
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,278
makes sense um we know that kyes we know

663
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:10,679
that ABA and ethylene are the stress

664
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,960
hormones so we should of course uh see

665
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,440
an over over representation of those we

666
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,278
know that kis and gpcrs are crucial for

667
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,759
signaling transduction Pathways and

668
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:22,000
we're actually seeing those um finding

669
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,879
salicylic acid it was really interesting

670
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,359
because this is been reported uh with

671
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,278
more plant pathogen interaction so this

672
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:32,678
is an interesting cross talk between the

673
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:35,000
biotic and abiotic type of a stress now

674
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,559
um the most interesting and uh part of

675
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,359
the go ter analysis it wasn't this it

676
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:44,319
was that we found 72 unique go terms

677
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:47,479
Associated exclusively with 24 hours

678
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:49,519
after Sol stress so all these 72 uh

679
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,679
unique go terms were not found uh

680
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,440
control six and uh when we think about

681
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,080
it actually makes sense because at this

682
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,038
at this stage uh cells have been exposed

683
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,480
to uh 24 hours of sodium chloride so

684
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,278
you're actually seeing a lot of cellular

685
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,000
damage and the cells and cells are

686
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:07,440
trying to cope up with it how do they do

687
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,519
that um one way is that they produce uh

688
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,080
lipid biosynthesis uh they you can you

689
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,038
can also see that there's a lot of

690
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:18,119
glycerol uh transport and you can also

691
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:20,398
observe from uh this uh go analysis that

692
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,959
uh cellular biological process such as

693
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,639
DNA replication DNA binding are highly

694
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,038
affected um so I just want to uh bring

695
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,120
this uh slide from the very beginning to

696
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:32,640
show that even in this really short list

697
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:35,639
of uh consequences we were able with

698
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,120
this uh with this analysis to

699
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,399
identifying uh how um membrane

700
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:44,038
stabilization and osmotic potential are

701
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:46,079
represented here now um so this this

702
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:48,158
analysis is what's really useful for us

703
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,720
to better understand the biology of the

704
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,519
cell stress um and this of course is a

705
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,558
really Bri brief summary so the last

706
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,120
thing I want to talk about um with this

707
00:28:55,558 --> 00:29:01,119
uh first part is the cluster

708
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:03,639
analysis and U so this is a heat map

709
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,558
where um using with the rsen package

710
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,840
again where we look at the differential

711
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:09,918
expressed transcript isoforms across the

712
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,558
different time points and in green you

713
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,519
see uppr regulated genes and red down

714
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,119
regulated genes and um one of the

715
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,319
interesting things about the hit Maps is

716
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:20,398
that uh or clustering for that matter is

717
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,359
that it allows you to identify uh

718
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,639
patterns of biological interest so Ren

719
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,599
actually gives a uh it gave us 12

720
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,600
cluster here and you can see how they

721
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,398
are related with this sideway dendrogram

722
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:35,759
and um and in the heat map you see that

723
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,759
this is a s six s 24 and the three

724
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,759
control which of course it makes sense

725
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,919
that the Sal cluster more closely than

726
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,798
the controls um and when we look at

727
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,559
these clusters uh there were four

728
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:49,119
clusters that were highly interesting

729
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:50,678
for me um uh two subclusters 7 and 12

730
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,239
were at the very bottom where you can

731
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,798
see that under salt there's a lot of

732
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,120
green colors and under control red color

733
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:02,319
then we have um the largest cluster to

734
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:04,158
and u a small cluster up here where you

735
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:06,918
actually see red colors under the result

736
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,519
and green colors under the control um so

737
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:09,600
the interest so this can be confusing

738
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,200
but the interesting thing about

739
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,119
clustering is that we can now go and

740
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,360
zoom into this clusters and look at the

741
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:20,239
profile of these genes that are behind

742
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:23,199
this so when we look at this uh for uh

743
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,399
subcluster of interest um by looking at

744
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,600
soucer 12 and seven the one that we at

745
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:29,719
the very bottom of the heat map we see

746
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,519
that um so each one of these Gray Line

747
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,240
correspond to a single transcript and

748
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,399
the the blue one correspond to a

749
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,519
consensus of the cluster we see that

750
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:40,000
under the control the expression of all

751
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:43,720
these genes is pretty low but when when

752
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,839
salt hits the expression in subter 7 and

753
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,000
12 it goes dramatically up uh in fact we

754
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:50,480
identify that these three AB regul

755
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,679
transcript were

756
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,880
chaperons uh over uh that were induced

757
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,679
over 90 folds uh and then this uh this

758
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,360
was the largest subcluster which wasn't

759
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:03,320
really interesting um it does show an

760
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,319
increase in their in their expression

761
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:08,038
upon solid stress but it's not nearly as

762
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:10,879
dramatic as these two cluster and uh

763
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:13,839
finally this was a interesting that we

764
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,320
only find in this whole LEF experiment

765
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,918
49 uh transcript that were highly

766
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,879
expressed under the control but upon s

767
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:24,038
treatment their expression would uh

768
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,919
would down dramatically now um for our

769
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:30,720
purpose purposes of uh narrowing down to

770
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:32,200
kind the genes we looked at this this uh

771
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,440
cluster which was the most interesting

772
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:38,759
for us and um we had 88 transcript that

773
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,919
had a really interesting pattern that we

774
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,879
that we were interested in following um

775
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,440
and there were interesting transcription

776
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,120
Factor like this one uh but

777
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,600
unfortunately some of this Gene had

778
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:52,278
already been described in literature U

779
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,199
so when we decided to select a few

780
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:55,919
candidate genes we of course we we

781
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,720
narrow it down to those ones that were

782
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,880
not previously described

783
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:03,679
and um so that led us this uh

784
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,080
discrimination of this uh of this Gene

785
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,960
led us to narrow it down to basically

786
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:10,000
eight candidate genes eight Noel

787
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,919
candidate genes that were not that have

788
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,638
never been uh have never been uh

789
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,480
described in literature for solid stress

790
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:18,599
um and we group these candidate genes

791
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,558
into two groups basically those that

792
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:24,359
were induced at both time points Sal 6

793
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:27,158
and Sal 24 they were induced by several

794
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:29,240
folds actually and uh the rest of the

795
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:32,799
candidate genes they were induced only

796
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,200
at 24 hours after cestr so when we look

797
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,079
at the profiles of these candidate genes

798
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,200
I just want to draw your attention right

799
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,798
right away to this one so um so the

800
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,319
expression of this Gene is amazing it

801
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:47,158
just it is virally zero under the

802
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:50,960
control but at 6 hours of Sol stress it

803
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:53,399
is induced by 17 folds and at 24 hours

804
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,399
of Sal stress it is induced by almost 60

805
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:58,518
fold so this makes this Gene really a

806
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,038
really interesting candidate and uh the

807
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:01,880
fact that it makes it also really

808
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:03,798
interesting is not that has a high

809
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,440
expression and induction but also is

810
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:08,918
unknown so uh we know that this Gene

811
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,480
Maps directly to chromosome 3 in tomato

812
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:12,278
but we weren't able we were not able to

813
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,120
retrieve any information about it we

814
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:16,200
know that it's not a chap room because

815
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:17,719
we wouldn't able to retrieve that uh so

816
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,519
following up this Gene would be really

817
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,480
really interesting um so these other

818
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,079
genes are also highly Express and

819
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,480
induced but not nearly as dramatic as

820
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,759
this unknown one and lastly to uh the

821
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,240
the last four candidate genes that uh

822
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,798
that we selected they were only highly

823
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,038
induced and highly expressed at 24 hours

824
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:40,319
so these genes uh are there are self

825
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:44,079
sensitive genes that are uh that are

826
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:48,119
late in the induction process um

827
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:50,759
so lastly uh I want to say that U doing

828
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:53,119
AR Sig is great it allow us to identify

829
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:55,679
uh cluster genes understand a little bit

830
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:58,079
of the biology of he stress but uh in

831
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,880
order to make this kind of gen official

832
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:03,638
quote unquote you need to do the

833
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,679
characterization of them um so so what

834
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:07,798
we did is that we ordered a few of these

835
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,599
mutants one of the eight candidate genes

836
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:13,679
that I just show you and um and by we

837
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:16,359
genotype um trying to find uh the

838
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,760
homozygotes that has the tdna insertion

839
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:21,159
in both alals um and we were able this

840
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,000
is only one one mutant we were able to

841
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:28,838
identify uh roughly like five lines of

842
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,280
homoy line for this uh for this genotype

843
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:33,599
now

844
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,639
um uh following up with this uh part of

845
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,838
the research it really takes time it is

846
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:41,119
a long process and I was running out of

847
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:43,878
time so I'm going to S suggest that uh

848
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,838
the next uh PhD student in Nils lab uh

849
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:47,279
maybe have a really interesting task to

850
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,960
follow up this Gene especially the

851
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,879
unknown one that's uh the unknown one

852
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,039
you can definitely leave you to a plan

853
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:56,559
cell type of publication um and I also I

854
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,599
also would like to say that the next uh

855
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,599
PD a student uh follow up with these

856
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:02,838
reverse uh genetic approaches screening

857
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,680
the mutants doing vixs as I said between

858
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:06,199
is a great model for vixs uh

859
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:09,319
complementation imp planta

860
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:11,759
overexpression with 35s and uh inducible

861
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,200
promoter and also like a more broad type

862
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,079
of research would be interesting just we

863
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:18,439
looked at only one uh one cultivar Mel

864
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:21,039
deploy but it would be interesting to

865
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,519
see if uh other petunia hybrid do

866
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:27,039
perform in the same way than this um

867
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:28,440
just to finish up this section um I like

868
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,159
to say that pretty much everything what

869
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,480
I just mentioned it was a publish in

870
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:36,078
pls1 the paper came out a couple of

871
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,240
weeks ago and it was a big collaboration

872
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,800
uh between of course Neil uh myself uh

873
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:43,000
people in plant biology orano who is

874
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,440
actually now a faculty member at

875
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,079
Virginia Tech uh Mike scanon and James

876
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:53,079
janoni and um also I'd like to

877
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,599
acknowledge um two of my colleagues uh

878
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:57,519
Margaret Frank who is now postling the

879
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,559
down for Center and Brian emed who

880
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:02,239
contributed with uh really thoughtful

881
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:04,880
comments uh especially Brian with a lot

882
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,439
of statistical Consulting help so

883
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,039
between all of them we were able to

884
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,440
publish this and we were really excited

885
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:13,838
about it um and so the last thing that I

886
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,920
want to talk about is uh how can we

887
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,880
expand basically these results uh now

888
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,838
with the reference genome and including

889
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,800
uh root

890
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:27,239
samples uh so the specific goal for this

891
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,519
was to compare um these using this

892
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:31,078
platform aluminum with and without

893
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,119
reference genome and I show you this

894
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,920
experimental design and I I said at the

895
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,000
beginning that we focus firstly on

896
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,318
leaves so now we're including everything

897
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,719
we already have the sequence for leaves

898
00:36:38,318 --> 00:36:42,800
so we just needed to include roots and

899
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:46,000
the only different thing that we use now

900
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,720
is that uh that we use the tuo package

901
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,920
so uh in this package basically uh you

902
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:54,039
map all the RS using top hat that runs B

903
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,480
TI two in the background to align all

904
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:59,599
the RS to the chromosomes uh and then

905
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,318
you use CF links to uh to look for all

906
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,519
the Align rats make them into transcript

907
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:07,599
and then with cfd you can look at G

908
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:09,400
expression so the question is why did I

909
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,680
bother to do all the denovo assembly in

910
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,160
the first place if you have reference

911
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:15,039
genome uh so as Neil said at the

912
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:16,799
beginning um we didn't really have a

913
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,679
reference zenome when we first started

914
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,680
but it wasn't until late September that

915
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,960
we started to collaborate with the

916
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:27,239
petuna genome Consortium which allow us

917
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:31,240
to use one of the reference genome uh so

918
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:33,318
very briefly um the pum Consortium it is

919
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:37,358
a really big effort between scientists

920
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:39,279
in both the US and Europe um basically

921
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:42,799
the probably the most important people

922
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,079
are uh in bti Lucas and or we have

923
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,519
people in Switzerland Chris ker uh

924
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:50,800
people in Italy and Tom Jareds in the

925
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:53,480
Netherland and as well as Franchesca uh

926
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,920
so this was great uh because it really

927
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,480
allow us to use the genome as a

928
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,680
reference and that expand a whole l lot

929
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,559
uh the way that we can do RNA sequencing

930
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:04,919
basically um so what are we specifically

931
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,358
doing with the pum project I can't

932
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,200
really say much because it hasn't been

933
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:10,719
published yet but uh one of the thing

934
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:12,559
that I'm looking at is um I'm looking at

935
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:15,679
molecular markers single nucleotide

936
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:18,119
polymorphism Snips uh to assess how many

937
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:22,598
transcript are inherited from each

938
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:25,200
parent to hia um for uh for the tuxedo

939
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,880
analysis what we used it was this genome

940
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,879
the eponia axillaris genome because the

941
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,760
both the functional and structural

942
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,760
annotation of the genome it was actually

943
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,160
in better shape than in flat um so you

944
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,520
can actually see that here we have

945
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:42,440
roughly 36,000 gen which is much less

946
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:45,480
than the 100,000 that I find in the the

947
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,119
no assembly uh but this using this uh

948
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:52,358
genome as a as a bioinformatic resource

949
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:54,880
it was of great help so um so we when we

950
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:57,480
run the analysis uh using tuxedo and the

951
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,519
reference genome uh we found actually

952
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,318
34,000 genes which is much much more

953
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:05,559
accurate than uh the 100,000 uni genes

954
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:10,318
that we find with the den noo uh we

955
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:13,039
found uh 37,000 isoforms with toxedo and

956
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:15,000
135,000 form with denovo so basically

957
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:18,480
there's no question that running toxedo

958
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,679
uh it is a much more accurate uh uh

959
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,800
approach to do RNA sequencing we

960
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:26,318
identify 11 roughly 11,000 differential

961
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,400
Express genes between roots and leaves

962
00:39:26,318 --> 00:39:30,599
uh over a million promoters and over a

963
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,200
million splicing sites when we look at

964
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,800
the tuxedo

965
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:36,598
output now one of the things that is

966
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,318
really interesting with tuxedo is that

967
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:39,960
you take everything into R and into R

968
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:42,279
you really can do whatever you can do

969
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,519
anything you want um and I like to uh do

970
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,240
the analogy uh with the cell cycle

971
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:47,960
because doing AR it is really like the

972
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,639
cell the cell cycle where you have a lot

973
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,199
of uh checkpoints um and if the

974
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,960
checkpoint has not been satisfied the

975
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:57,000
cell cycle stops so with the RN is

976
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,000
really the same so this is the the first

977
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,880
checkpoint for us where we see how do

978
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,800
the sample cluster together um so in

979
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,280
this case in this dendrogram we see that

980
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,280
we have two big branches one

981
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,000
corresponding to roots and one

982
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,599
corresponding to leaves so so this makes

983
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,119
sense because Roots should be more

984
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,838
closely related to each other than

985
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,318
leaves so if you don't see this sort of

986
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:17,920
pattern there is something that went

987
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:19,960
wrong and you have to stop and go back

988
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,599
and in fact uh I had to do this twice

989
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,838
because one of the script that I wrote

990
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,640
it wasn't good um so and when you look

991
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:29,480
now between this Branch you see that the

992
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:33,358
control cluster more closely together

993
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,559
than the Sal treatment so so this is

994
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,880
this is a really good sign that you're

995
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,119
on the right track uh when you look at

996
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,960
the at all the biological replicates and

997
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,760
the technical replicates here you see

998
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,480
that they also clustered together you

999
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,960
see all the leaf uh sou 24 cluster here

1000
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,240
um so this is again is a good indication

1001
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,800
that U that you're doing things well um

1002
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:57,199
when we look at differential Express

1003
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,640
genes now with tuxedo we actually can uh

1004
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:03,000
can uh can further look into leaves and

1005
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:05,400
roots and with with this toxo package we

1006
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,358
were able to identify 6,700

1007
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,200
differentially expressed genes some of

1008
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:12,279
them that were exclusively expressed in

1009
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:14,279
this early time Point some of them were

1010
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,519
exclusively expressed in this later time

1011
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,359
point and of course some of these decks

1012
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:21,960
are expressed between both time points

1013
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:24,000
um and so with the denova assembly we

1014
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,920
were able to identify 7,000 uh

1015
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,239
differential Express genes which wasn't

1016
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,079
that far off from what we actually found

1017
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,559
here so that was pretty cool um and

1018
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:36,960
again we did the same thing with the

1019
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:38,440
roots they specific genes uh induced at

1020
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,559
this time point and all at all time

1021
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,200
point now uh as I said this is uh still

1022
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:44,799
uh ongoing research I don't have all the

1023
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,000
data that I like to show but one of the

1024
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,960
thing that I'm currently working on is I

1025
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,440
see well how many genes are differential

1026
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,240
expressed that are between leaf and

1027
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,559
Roots so that's going to be interesting

1028
00:41:53,239 --> 00:42:00,358
to know um uh lastly uh so I still need

1029
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:03,199
to do uh geneontology analysis for uh

1030
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:06,559
for tuxedo uh do the clustering using

1031
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:09,598
these uh two softwares and um and talk

1032
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:11,559
about candidate genes now um I don't

1033
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,760
have all the candidate genes but uh we

1034
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:16,279
do have this one that it has a really

1035
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,880
amazing profile uh that you can actually

1036
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,440
see that the expression it remains

1037
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:24,760
pretty flat actually zero in leavs uh

1038
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,838
even in Roots but only at root Sal six

1039
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:32,319
it is expressed over 100 our fpkm

1040
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:34,960
induced 24 fs and at root 24 U it is

1041
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,199
induced by almost 80 FS so uh the

1042
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,519
expression of this kind of jeans is

1043
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:41,399
amazing um it is uh this is the

1044
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:44,838
orthologue in tomato I need to still

1045
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:48,119
look the function of it um and then uh

1046
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:51,279
lastly I just want to wrap up with some

1047
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:54,280
conclusions so uh we actually develop a

1048
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,839
really Noel transcripton of of p hia and

1049
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,519
soless where we identify over thousand

1050
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:02,000
different uh abated genes and through

1051
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:05,440
cluster analysis we were able to narrow

1052
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,920
it down to a candidate genes um however

1053
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,720
using tuo package it uh it's really a

1054
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,599
much more accurate uh B informatic tool

1055
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,318
that giv you a better representation of

1056
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:17,160
gene expression and differentially

1057
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:20,719
expressed genes um I'm still working on

1058
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:23,440
um on finishing up with this this Tu

1059
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:25,279
package you uh I need to do the ontology

1060
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,000
and the clustering and then one of the

1061
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,800
thing that I really want to do is

1062
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,719
compare uh how do the C the genes from

1063
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:36,240
the denovo compare to the uh toit

1064
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:39,358
analysis um so lastly I'd like to uh

1065
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:42,598
acknowledge uh Mike scanon from plant

1066
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:46,318
biology uh marine hansome and Debbie

1067
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:49,119
from MBG also all the collaboration with

1068
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:50,920
James janoni we really appreciate that

1069
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,240
uh orelo was the bi informatician that

1070
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,920
helped us a lot with this um he also

1071
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:56,919
taught me a lot of bionformatics so I'm

1072
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,318
really grateful to him Lucas Mueller we

1073
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:02,519
run all the all the software for free

1074
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:04,519
basically in a huge server at the bti so

1075
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:06,000
that was great also the Cornell

1076
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:09,400
sequencing facility they did a really

1077
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,920
good job and lastly I want to uh very

1078
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:15,240
specially thank uh Dr n

1079
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,920
matsum uh so as he said I came in 2008

1080
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:21,598
and nellia was young and this is in 2008

1081
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:24,440
uh so this is isic uh so I just want to

1082
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:27,119
thank Neil for uh all his patient all

1083
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,679
his mentoring has been a great advisor

1084
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,760
some went really great to work wigs and

1085
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,598
I'm basically uh mostly grateful because

1086
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,720
he really led me wander off pretty far

1087
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:38,480
away from his owner of expertise uh so

1088
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:41,078
he was willing to collaborate and learn

1089
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,760
with me which is something that sometime

1090
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:45,519
faculty members don't do and I think his

1091
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,000
his really kind approach to do that uh

1092
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:51,039
enable us to build a a stronger network

1093
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,599
connection in in Cornell um so Dyan

1094
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,480
wasn't in wasn't even in the map at this

1095
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:58,119
point uh the only weird thing about new

1096
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,679
I have to say say is that he likes to uh

1097
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:03,838
think in really strange places and uh

1098
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:09,159
this is one of

1099
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:11,519
them um so um I when I first came I

1100
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:15,000
thought maybe it was an American thing

1101
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:19,199
uh but um I realized that no it was

1102
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,400
Neil but um anyway uh he always even

1103
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:24,598
even in this places he wanted to talk

1104
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:27,160
about our research uh and I always was

1105
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:28,519
procrastinating and lastly uh I also

1106
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:31,480
want to thank my girlfriend Amanda for

1107
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:33,079
all her support and uh and of course her

1108
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,079
dog

1109
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:37,720
and and this is the last slide I also

1110
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,599
want to thank the horiculture department

1111
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:43,318
very much for this great six years uh

1112
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:46,680
also Soho for supporting six years as

1113
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:49,759
well and um all the biology different

1114
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:51,318
biotas that I've done over the the last

1115
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,760
four years that I've been here uh

1116
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:57,159
actually Professor Duron is here who

1117
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,000
runs this bio um and and thank you thank

1118
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:02,960
you for everything and if there's any

1119
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,960
question I'm happy to answer

1120
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:17,079
that is that you said 2% of your un M to

1121
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,440
bacteria do you think it's because uh

1122
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:22,200
the funas were infected with certain

1123
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,960
diseases or La contamination good

1124
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:26,558
question where do those bacterial gen

1125
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,159
come from yeah uh question there's

1126
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,400
always some little percent of

1127
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:32,519
contamination with d I don't I don't

1128
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,680
know exactly where I'm coming from we

1129
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:39,119
did grow the the lot ofter there um and

1130
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:42,318
maybe when we did the RNA instruction we

1131
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,640
capture a few bacteria as opposed

1132
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:47,558
to it

1133
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:50,838
was did you find any human gen like

1134
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:50,839
suggesting uh

1135
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,800
yeah

1136
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,720
hey um at the very beginning of your

1137
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:06,838
talk you could have a slide showing the

1138
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:12,519
general response mechanisms for um for

1139
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:17,039
soft stress um our sos1 and sodium prot

1140
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:22,039
anti those two genes are among the up

1141
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:23,199
regulated sodium prot anti okay yeah is

1142
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:27,920
a sodium

1143
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:27,919
prot both are up regulated yeah

1144
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:36,039
they did you find them in your oh find

1145
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:37,720
sorry U actually no and um and that's a

1146
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:41,199
good question and and the answer for

1147
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:43,719
that is that is is a model that you

1148
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:45,960
really with spend our stress so we think

1149
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:47,919
that under 24 hours you start seeing

1150
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,079
damage but you don't see uh you don't

1151
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,318
see the articulation of this mechanism

1152
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,079
so if you want to see for example the

1153
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:58,920
exclusion mechanism here you would have

1154
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:02,119
to expose plants to uh to 48 96 hours

1155
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,119
and then you will see these typ

1156
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:13,399
responses how long is it going to take

1157
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:18,079
to provide information to plant

1158
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:18,079
readers come up with more

1159
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:26,240
resistant that's a good question too um

1160
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,318
so I think it will take a long time uh

1161
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:30,399
because uh as I said the functional

1162
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:33,239
characterization of the G is equally as

1163
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,358
important as as the R so we just

1164
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:39,239
identify a no kind of je that may or may

1165
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:42,838
not be suitable for to use as Mar for

1166
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:42,838
breing or to use for genetic

1167
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,599
engineering thank you
