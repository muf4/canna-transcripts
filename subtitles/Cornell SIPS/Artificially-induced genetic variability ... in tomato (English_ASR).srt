1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,439
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,439
university

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,400
so

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:15,359
i've been there a long long time ago

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,359
just for a quick visit to cornell i

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:21,839
think actually it was 26 years ago i

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,880
have the pleasure to visit the cornell

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,399
and in winter it's absolutely beautiful

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,518
i really enjoy

10
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,118
being there

11
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,839
so today

12
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,839
i will

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,079
talk about some work that we are doing

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:41,119
in our group at the bordeaux and i will

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,840
talk about the use of artificially

16
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:47,599
induced genetic

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,600
variability and show you some new

18
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,159
work that we are doing it's not

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,878
unfinished

20
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:57,119
stories we are still working on that but

21
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,839
i wanted to share you

22
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,878
to share with you some results the

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,920
recent results result that we got and

24
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,239
the strategy that we are currently

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,519
using to

26
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,839
identify the genes and alleles that are

27
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,640
underlying

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,960
phenotypic trait quality traits in

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,960
tomato so as we said before i'm from

30
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,118
bordeaux bordeaux it's a

31
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,000
beautiful town

32
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,599
well known for the seaside which is a

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,280
white sea side

34
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,239
and also of course for wine

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,519
and

36
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:42,000
actually in our lab we are working on

37
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:44,798
tomato not on grape and this is

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,719
because as i will show you

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,159
later tomato is a wonderful model for

40
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,319
fleshy fruits

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,680
so this is all up we are joined up

42
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,879
between

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,159
inua and bordeaux university

44
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,280
and we will have a pleasure to welcome

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,000
you

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,040
at the end of this year to the soul

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,360
meeting in bordeaux the end of

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,480
october

49
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,680
so as i said before tomato is a model

50
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,519
food for

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,680
many fleshy fruits including grape which

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,480
is also a berry

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,920
and what you interceding is

54
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:29,119
mostly ali fruit development before

55
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:32,639
ripening and especially the

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,319
cell expansion stage where most of the

57
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,799
fruit weight is

58
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,199
gained by the the fruit we have the

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,200
largest increase in food

60
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:45,759
weight during this ages before

61
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,439
after the cell division and before the

62
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,120
ripening

63
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:54,159
and what happens is that during basilic

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,759
expansion stage you have a huge increase

65
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:01,680
in cell size a set size can go from

66
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:03,439
50 micron in some varieties to one

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,080
millimeter

68
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,719
length so you can

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,000
almost see the

70
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,759
the cell with the naked eyes

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,120
and what happens we have a large

72
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,598
increase in a cell vacuole

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,200
increase in soluble content sugars

74
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:25,518
organic acid ions and so on

75
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:28,639
you have also and this is something that

76
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,480
you don't find in grape but that you

77
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:36,158
have in in tomato you have a shift from

78
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:39,439
mitotic cycle to on the cycle which is a

79
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,199
simplified say cycle and a large

80
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,759
increase in

81
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:47,119
nucleus fluidity

82
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,639
and of course

83
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,080
you have a

84
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:55,119
storage of a starch

85
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
that disappears during ripening

86
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,039
and

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,560
membrane cell wall and cortical

88
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,000
biosynthesis

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,519
to

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,840
to cope with this large increase in in

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,360
food size

92
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,560
so what you interceding and i will

93
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,280
talk a little bit about that is the

94
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,560
mechanism that are involved in the food

95
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:24,000
development at the cell expansion phase

96
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,000
and the regulation coordination of these

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,600
processes

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,720
so i will talk about two strategies that

99
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,199
you have

100
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,919
been using in the last years

101
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,879
the first one going from candidate

102
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:42,879
identifying candidate genes and going to

103
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,959
a phenotype and this is as i said before

104
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,399
and published results we are still

105
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,399
working on that

106
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:54,159
but i will show you how we try to

107
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:57,359
to tackle uh this question so what you

108
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,320
have done this is the fruit you have a

109
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,759
capital wall here pericarp

110
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,319
and within

111
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,759
the fruit we have been interested in two

112
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,839
expanding

113
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,319
tissues between

114
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,319
after celibate

115
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
didn't work anymore

116
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,519
okay

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,240
after

118
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,959
cell division stage to be onset of

119
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,360
ripening so we have been looking at b

120
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,839
cells here in the mesocarp and you can

121
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
see that you have a large increase

122
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,439
in cell size

123
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,000
and the other tissues

124
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:43,038
we have been looking at is tissues in

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,478
the locular tissue in virgil where you

126
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:49,199
have also large increase in cell size

127
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,279
but these cells are clearly different

128
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,720
and have a different fate

129
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:58,319
so we have been looking at that

130
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,720
doing a metabolom analysis transfer

131
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,159
analysis this has been done some time

132
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,440
ago so it was with microwave and you can

133
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,919
see that the tissues broccoli tissue

134
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,680
and mesocarp tissue the cells are

135
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,879
clearly different

136
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,519
are the same trajectory but are clearly

137
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:21,759
different and for example if you look at

138
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:23,038
the sucrose here it mostly accumulates

139
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,840
in the

140
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:29,038
blocular tissues and the same for

141
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:32,159
garbanzo and so on so clearly we have

142
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:35,759
two tissues that are evolving during the

143
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,880
cell expansion but that are

144
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,000
clearly also different and we did the

145
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,639
same for

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,639
tranships

147
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,600
what

148
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:50,560
we were mostly interested in regular

149
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,759
origins and what we did is

150
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,360
correlations between for example

151
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,360
one metabolite here

152
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,479
again one metabolite here glutamine

153
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,800
tranships and so on

154
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,439
and we had a several

155
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
large number of pairwise wise

156
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,680
correlation

157
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,520
and we went for looking at this

158
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,400
correlation between metabolite gene

159
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,318
and then between genes and other genes

160
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:24,560
and metabolites

161
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:27,759
and looking for heps that are

162
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,680
in that case a genes with high number of

163
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,319
correlations

164
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,680
and what we wanted to know is whether

165
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,240
this helps

166
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,360
but show strong regulation if the two

167
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,199
tissues at first stage of development

168
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,120
could be involved in what we are

169
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,439
interested in

170
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,800
cell expansion or transition to other

171
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,839
chs

172
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,840
so

173
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,839
we draw a very basic

174
00:07:51,918 --> 00:08:00,000
correlation network and we had several

175
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:01,198
genes but were identified as herbs

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,319
among them

177
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,439
uh what we are and i think many people

178
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,160
here know them quite well much better

179
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,279
than

180
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,400
i do

181
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,478
berlin

182
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,560
and we know that this gene is very

183
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,959
important

184
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,598
for uh in the

185
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:24,239
intriguing the onset of ripening no

186
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,800
this is the same this is a mutant very

187
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,079
important for raping

188
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,280
ap2 we know that one homolog has been

189
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,158
recently

190
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,158
been shown to be

191
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,120
regulating fruit ripening

192
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,639
and these two genes with no information

193
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,360
and so we are

194
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:48,000
quite confident that these genes

195
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,879
could be important for regulating

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,278
protrapping because the other candidates

197
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:56,879
coming out were already

198
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:59,278
identified as important regulators

199
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,879
so we have been looking into that this

200
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,919
is the

201
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:08,000
two gene one is mostly expressed during

202
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,519
cell expansion and then decrease later

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,278
the other one

204
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,000
mostly

205
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,120
increasing after at the end of this cell

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,320
expansion

207
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
but what is quite interesting is that v

208
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,120
genes

209
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,720
because we were working on cell

210
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,720
expansion these genes

211
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,799
have the expression modified before the

212
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,000
mature green stage

213
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,799
so during the cell expansion so we have

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,399
been

215
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:43,759
using the tools available using

216
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,480
what we developed before a food specific

217
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,838
promoter that is

218
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
strongly

219
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,600
expressed during the cell expansion

220
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,839
stage

221
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,839
and

222
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,200
this

223
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:02,559
promoter drive expression specifically

224
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,200
in the cells that are undergoing

225
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:10,000
expansion in the food this is in

226
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:13,839
comparison 35 that's a promoter

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,720
so what we did is over expression lnri

228
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,839
no

229
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,480
resort

230
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,320
and then cressy technology which

231
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,320
basically

232
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,360
allows

233
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,399
us to have a kind of dominant negative

234
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,600
mutant for this basic

235
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,559
factor

236
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,079
and what we have is these roots are

237
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,518
whiter

238
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,559
accumulate much less starch

239
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,639
than

240
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:44,078
the

241
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,078
white type fruit

242
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,120
which may also result in reduced

243
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,278
accumulation of glucose fructose later

244
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,000
during ripening

245
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,000
marmalade

246
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:02,479
increased firmness which can be related

247
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,920
to effect on fruit ripening because what

248
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,399
we saw is that these transgenic lights

249
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:12,958
with different transients that we had a

250
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,039
strong effect on fruit ripening

251
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,278
so we have been looking at that in

252
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,399
detail you can see the differences

253
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:23,278
between basic and y-type

254
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,639
and you can't clearly see that a breaker

255
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,120
uh onset of ripening plus seven days

256
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,519
it's almost ripe

257
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,440
already ripe and white up

258
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,839
what it

259
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,839
you have a ripe food after

260
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:43,440
15 days after breaker stage so we are at

261
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,079
the spring point we are working on that

262
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,480
and working on different

263
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,199
different

264
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,159
strategies to try to understand

265
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,959
how

266
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,319
beijing can be

267
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,879
contouring

268
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,240
fruit ripening i won't go into the

269
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,600
detail but what i would like to insist

270
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,600
on

271
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,079
today in my talk today

272
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,440
is the second strategy that we began to

273
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:16,399
use to develop a few years ago

274
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,639
which is to go to identify mutants and

275
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,679
to go from phenotype

276
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:25,440
to the function of a gene

277
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:29,359
so one of the reasons as i showed before

278
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,720
a reverse genetics approach can be quite

279
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,800
successful we have tools now and it was

280
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,278
very really

281
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,639
basic at that time but i think what is

282
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:43,519
done now with honest second is this

283
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,919
large correlation network we kind of

284
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,600
have very good insights

285
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:53,278
upon the putative function of genes but

286
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,600
still we need to do plant transformation

287
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,078
we don't know whether it can have a

288
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,360
phenotype or not because it can be

289
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,919
redundant and functions and so on

290
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,120
and what we wanted to develop what you

291
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,159
did

292
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,839
is to go for forward genetics

293
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,199
approaches

294
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,000
so

295
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,040
in tomato especially i think the

296
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,839
wonderful resources develop with a

297
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,439
natural

298
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,240
viability but

299
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,720
in most cases what you need is to have

300
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,399
large fields

301
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,759
greenhouses human resources and so on

302
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,600
and i like very much this picture from

303
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,879
dennis amir for example

304
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,759
with uh collecting fruits in uh echo in

305
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,919
the north of israel and i think most of

306
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,679
lab at least also

307
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,719
do not have these

308
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,759
facilities what we have instead is graph

309
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,278
chambers

310
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:57,519
greenhouses and so on so what we did and

311
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:59,039
we began that 10 or 15 years ago

312
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,399
is to develop

313
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:05,039
artificially induced genetic

314
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,759
diversity in tomato

315
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,958
and for that we choose the

316
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,319
miniature cultivar microtome

317
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,278
and

318
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,480
because it can be a very nice additional

319
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:21,039
source of genetic diversity for

320
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,920
functional studies of target gene when

321
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,480
you have a candidate for gene discovery

322
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,278
and i will show you how

323
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,199
how

324
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:33,679
all sources of new allies for

325
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:33,679
breathing

326
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,439
and one interesting thing is that gender

327
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:42,958
background is identical

328
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,480
between all mutants except for induced

329
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,439
mutation

330
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,039
so

331
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,000
what we choose

332
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,599
chose is this miniature cutive

333
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,679
because it

334
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,519
you can grow them in greenhouse

335
00:14:53,679 --> 00:15:00,000
year-round high density short cycle

336
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,360
they carries at least two recessive

337
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,720
mutation what one is dwarf but that

338
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,159
affects bracinosteroid

339
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:14,879
synthesis not in the foot but in the

340
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:17,600
vegetative tissues of a plant an sp

341
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,519
mutation which affects

342
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,800
which control

343
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,919
determinate

344
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,240
growth

345
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:27,679
seconds has been

346
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,560
genome has been sequenced recently and

347
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:33,439
so it's quite well adapted as a model

348
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,638
cultiva for functional genomics in

349
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,199
tomato and something that can be quite

350
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:43,120
interesting when you use microtome you

351
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,120
cross it with one of these

352
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,240
old pound

353
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:51,518
which is a money maker this is f1 that

354
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,839
looks like that is very similar to the

355
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,560
money maker

356
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,440
parent so what we did and we did that

357
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,039
several years ago now

358
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,040
we developed a

359
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,958
mutant connection we are currently using

360
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,879
8500

361
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:14,078
m2 families for chilling for identifying

362
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,958
target genes mutations in target genes

363
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:19,078
and we did at the same time phenotyping

364
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,879
of

365
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:24,559
3500

366
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:28,159
families and this has been stored in a

367
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:30,719
mutant database that we are using

368
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,519
what i have to say is that several

369
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,199
collections in microderma are

370
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,839
generated now one being in tsukuba

371
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:44,719
university and we have developed a joint

372
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:47,680
club for sharing these resources

373
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,800
so how can we use that as i said before

374
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:54,399
we have been throwing this phenotypic

375
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:56,399
data in database you can search it for

376
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,278
different keywords

377
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,159
and what we are currently doing i won't

378
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:05,439
talk about that today but it's

379
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,838
very very interesting screening for

380
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,480
vitamin c mutants

381
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:13,438
and it has been known for sugar mutants

382
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,480
and you can have mutants with as much

383
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,240
sugar

384
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,000
than uh in grape for example and

385
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,199
something that we are

386
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,439
beginning soon is to screen for starch

387
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,079
mutants

388
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,640
so this is just to show you

389
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:33,279
give you an idea of the diversity that

390
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,799
you have actually you have more than

391
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:38,798
three uh

392
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:41,759
35 000 different annotation mutations

393
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:44,480
that are phenotypic alterations but when

394
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:47,679
annotated so you can have a large

395
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,038
diversity that you find in

396
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,798
natural resources in food shape

397
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,839
something that is a

398
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,558
very

399
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,399
strange looking fruit

400
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:02,558
color

401
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,519
aspect this one has been isolated

402
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:09,038
which is a critical mutant

403
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:11,759
and i will talk about that today is we

404
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:14,079
are interested in in fruit morphology

405
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:18,160
fruit size and fruit

406
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:19,119
morphology and this is the work

407
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,038
from

408
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,199
lucy fernandez

409
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,599
and the other work i'm going to talk

410
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,798
about which is work from

411
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,639
yuan putty was the currently at the

412
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:31,519
kernel for two weeks

413
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,480
is

414
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,839
fruit

415
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,319
surface aspect and cuticle

416
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,639
so what we are

417
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,639
first

418
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:48,880
trait i will focus on is the fruit size

419
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,639
so uh fruit size depends on both same

420
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,080
number

421
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,840
couple number

422
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,119
so this is determined

423
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:58,879
mostly or in part

424
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,279
before

425
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,600
through set and then

426
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,240
after fruit set you see lab cell

427
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,759
division that will determine the number

428
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,599
of cells

429
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,558
and job also a cell enhancement that

430
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,199
will

431
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:15,200
determine

432
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,479
the size of a cell and depends in a

433
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,679
tightly curry

434
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,759
correlated in tomato to

435
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,880
undo reduplication

436
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,038
process

437
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,120
nucleus clarity

438
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,200
and so what you see here

439
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,558
is from the

440
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,880
outer pericarp to

441
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,038
the

442
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,039
inside of fruit and you have a cross

443
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:48,079
section of the tomato parka

444
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,400
so what we have been looking looking at

445
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,759
is mutants in

446
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:58,480
with a variation in food size

447
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,679
and or variation in a pericarp

448
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,400
thickness

449
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:08,240
so this is how we do it we screen

450
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,200
do such a database for example food

451
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:15,120
large food looking at what we have in a

452
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,798
database including pictures confirm that

453
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,239
phenotypes

454
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:24,558
by growing the plants and this is what

455
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,599
we can get for example this is why type

456
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:31,038
fruit you can see here from here you

457
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:34,719
have a outer epidermis inner epidermis

458
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:38,798
mesocarp here very large cells

459
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,600
this mutant which is a large

460
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,480
food size mutant you can see that you

461
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,519
have

462
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,640
more cells layer but mostly

463
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,759
larger cells and this is linked to an

464
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,600
increased

465
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:57,919
this is a c value here increase on the

466
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,959
reduction so you have large cells with

467
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,159
larger

468
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,519
nucleus

469
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,280
in that case what you have is a

470
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,960
thin pericarp

471
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,319
small cells

472
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,200
but in that case it's it is uncoupled

473
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,119
from other application because you see

474
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,798
love

475
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,759
large nucleus

476
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,759
but

477
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:24,240
small cells so to understand uh how the

478
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:27,359
growth process process

479
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,200
proceeds in tomato these mutants

480
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,000
can be quite

481
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,000
interesting so what we have done is to

482
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,720
work on these different mutants

483
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,839
characters them and so on this is a

484
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,200
principal component analysis and for

485
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,240
example

486
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,558
what we can see here is that we can have

487
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,079
small fruits with

488
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,720
small cells

489
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:53,519
but with both high chlorine

490
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,558
and low chlorine low ploidy we are

491
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:59,679
waiting for but in that case we can have

492
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:01,279
small fruit a small cell mutant with a

493
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,600
high employee

494
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,678
again we are much interested in

495
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,639
understanding how employee is

496
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,480
controlling set size on food size and

497
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,759
these are very nice

498
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,240
tools

499
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,759
so this is what

500
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,480
i said before

501
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:23,038
it can be very useful material

502
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,400
so we want it and we are focusing on

503
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:28,798
several of these mutants they i will

504
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,720
show you an example on this one which is

505
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,918
a thin pericapped

506
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,480
mutant with low fluidy

507
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,480
and you can see here that the pericappe

508
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,640
is very thinner than in white up fruit

509
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,079
and it has also that we don't see it

510
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,080
much here

511
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,879
different shape

512
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,000
and what you have done and i will go

513
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,400
rapidly

514
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,679
through it what you have done is to

515
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,480
begin to do a rough characterization of

516
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,679
this

517
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,319
mutant

518
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,440
so if you look at fruit rate in two

519
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:06,240
different conditions one with a

520
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,960
controlled food number one with

521
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:13,038
uncontrolled for the number in both

522
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,759
cases in blue fruit weight is lower

523
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:18,558
it has also an effect on

524
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:19,599
fruit firmness here you have a white

525
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,879
type

526
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:27,038
here and you have two uh different

527
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,600
generation of this mutant bc1 f2 and f3

528
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,158
i won't go into body dates these are the

529
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,199
two colors but

530
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,240
anyway

531
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,679
firmness is higher in that mutant and

532
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,798
this is not due because fruit size is

533
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,519
very often dependent on seed number and

534
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:48,319
actually based mutant has even more

535
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:51,119
seeds than white

536
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:53,200
so we have a small fruit mutant with

537
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,199
high seed number

538
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,600
more

539
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,600
dry matter high firmness

540
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:07,440
and we have been looking at a tissue

541
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:10,879
level details so what we what we did is

542
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:14,640
to look at the cross sections that you

543
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,120
see here white up and the mutant looking

544
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,840
at pericarp thickness again

545
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:23,359
can't clearly see that perk up thickness

546
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:26,319
is different using tomato analyzer

547
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,879
developed by esther atonic knapp

548
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,000
we did the same for pericarp

549
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,039
area

550
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,159
we clearly see that it's uh different

551
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:38,879
and we did also uh ploidy measurement

552
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,200
and we see here chloe index

553
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,278
it's a low ploidy

554
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,919
mutant

555
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,119
but when we looked so it was quite

556
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,600
interesting

557
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:53,439
trying to understand why

558
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,439
this perk up thickness is

559
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,479
smaller

560
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:03,119
we have been looking ahead at the cell

561
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,519
tissue so actually different cells and

562
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:09,119
what we saw and this is quite

563
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,158
interesting is that the mean cell

564
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,038
area

565
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,320
is

566
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:16,319
much lower in the mutant

567
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,880
um

568
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,200
what you have

569
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,200
is more or less

570
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,200
you say more or less because it's very

571
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,159
difficult to be sure

572
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,679
of that

573
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:32,799
it's more or less the same uh same uh

574
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,840
number of cell layers but what we saw

575
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:38,558
and it's not clear from here this is

576
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:42,639
white up uh you look in the mesocap you

577
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:46,079
have only large cells except around the

578
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,000
vessels but in the mutants what we saw

579
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,720
is that b cells

580
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,599
some of these cells instead of

581
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,360
differentiating expanding and so on are

582
00:25:53,599 --> 00:26:00,719
still undergoing cell division so we

583
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,959
still have we believe mitosis cycle and

584
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,319
this can last until

585
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,919
ripening

586
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,558
stage so

587
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,799
we clearly have a

588
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:14,079
different contour of a

589
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:18,000
probably the shift from a mitotic cycle

590
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:19,599
to beyond the cycle in that mutant

591
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,480
and we have

592
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,519
also looked at the different

593
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,798
different

594
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,679
traits

595
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,519
the time until ripening is more or less

596
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,559
the same

597
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:36,000
even shorter in that mutant

598
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:40,158
we have some defects which are not from

599
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,640
critical defects with brown spots

600
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,840
but what we clearly see

601
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,240
also

602
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,959
and we couldn't separate

603
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,720
this trait from

604
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,400
this

605
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,200
backup thickness

606
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,880
weight is that where the difference in

607
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,038
ripening and we have uneven ripening

608
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,400
in the mutant

609
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:07,119
and looking more in detail about at

610
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,080
ripening what we could see

611
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:14,000
is that actually it takes much more time

612
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:16,079
after break of stage to reach red rap

613
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,919
stage in the

614
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:21,278
mutant

615
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,679
so what we believe is that we are still

616
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:25,759
working on that if you have a mutant

617
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,480
where you affect

618
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,480
early fruit development

619
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,038
and at the same time

620
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,400
you also affect ripening so later stages

621
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:37,679
of food

622
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,480
development

623
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,360
so of course this is quite interesting

624
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,240
trying to look at these both

625
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:48,479
processes and we wanted to know which

626
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,159
gene is underlying

627
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,159
this weight of this trait

628
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,960
we have been looking before that we have

629
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,158
been looking a little more a bit more in

630
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,600
detail

631
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:04,720
tomato food normally accumulates soluble

632
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:08,719
sugars this is white type we accumulate

633
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,278
sodium sugars these are mutant lines and

634
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:16,720
clearly fruit composition is different

635
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:18,798
we don't accumulate glucose or fructose

636
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,759
and we have been looking but these are

637
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,200
very

638
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,359
preliminary work looking at the

639
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,640
expression of known

640
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:31,918
ripening regulators or acid induced

641
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,120
genes and what we can see is that all

642
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:39,200
the expression of all this gene

643
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:41,119
is strongly delayed compared to

644
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,558
white type

645
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,439
fruit

646
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:48,960
so as i said before what we wanted to do

647
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,000
was to identify the mutation

648
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,720
so a strategy that you have been using

649
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,599
is mapping by sequencing taking

650
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,360
advantage of the availability of a

651
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:04,240
tomato genome since two years now

652
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,599
and current development of the next

653
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,278
generation

654
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:13,038
sequencing technology

655
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:16,440
so one classical way for that is to

656
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:20,319
across the mutant with for example

657
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,798
pampinitholium which is another

658
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,558
close but white

659
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,119
tomato

660
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:29,278
species

661
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,918
problem that we are believing that

662
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:34,720
working for example on full-size mutant

663
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:38,399
is if you do that crossing microtome

664
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,519
with something that is quite different

665
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:44,959
what you will have in f2 segregating

666
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,278
population is segregating for many many

667
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,558
different traits including pericarp

668
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:53,440
thickness fruit size and anthron so it

669
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:56,240
can be very problematic and this is the

670
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,519
case for that we saw that for cortical

671
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,798
when you have a very strong

672
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,359
mutation you can't steal phenotype

673
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:08,679
population when it's more

674
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,678
di and

675
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:18,319
less severe mutation is very difficult

676
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,200
so what we did is to go for uh

677
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,960
for

678
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:26,558
angels mapping on the by bulk segregate

679
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,720
analysis so the idea is

680
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,278
to cross the mutant

681
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,519
the yellow mutant with white hat

682
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,038
microatom that doesn't carry

683
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,240
a mutation

684
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:41,440
in case because this is a more simple

685
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,519
case monogenic recessive mutation which

686
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,679
was the case of a

687
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,440
fin by carbon mutant

688
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,399
you can go to bc1 f2 and then you have a

689
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,278
segregation between

690
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:58,319
plants showing the white type

691
00:30:55,278 --> 00:31:02,398
phenotype and plants showing a mutant

692
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:06,319
and phenotype you can bulk them

693
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,678
two balls white up like unmutant like

694
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,918
and then

695
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,798
you can go for

696
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,759
wood genome sequencing what you need

697
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:17,679
using illumina comparison with a

698
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,000
reference genome

699
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,000
nice

700
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:26,479
thing with that is that the

701
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:30,879
only source of genetic and phenotypic

702
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:34,319
variability are the ems mutation

703
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,360
these mutation can be used as

704
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,319
snp

705
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,639
markers later and i will show that this

706
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,639
is very uh useful

707
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,480
so we did that

708
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,480
what so what you can wait for when you

709
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,558
have a recessive mutation causal

710
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,919
mutation homozygous here in

711
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:57,519
in yellow and this is unlinked mutation

712
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,360
in in green

713
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,599
if you look at uh

714
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,639
unlinked mutation in

715
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,199
a

716
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,320
buttonbox or whiteoutbug

717
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,240
the

718
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,000
frequency will be

719
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,159
0.5

720
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,960
when you look at the mutation that you

721
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:20,720
are interested in the causal mutation

722
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,079
what you are waiting for is a

723
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,960
frequency of one in the mutant bulk

724
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,839
but

725
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,840
you have because you took out all the

726
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,440
plants with mutant

727
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:37,038
phenotype

728
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:41,360
frequency is reduced in the

729
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:44,319
wild type bulk so we did that

730
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:47,038
and this is what i explained before for

731
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:49,759
example unlink mutation if you look at a

732
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:53,440
chromosome that doesn't carry mutation

733
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:56,640
you have a mean frequency around 0.5 if

734
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,200
you look at one region in a chromosome

735
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,120
that carries mutation but

736
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,919
unlinked region

737
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:06,239
the same frequency and then you when you

738
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,919
go close very close to the causal

739
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,519
mutation frequency of a mutated allele

740
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,919
increases

741
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,278
but that be opposite in the

742
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,240
mutant

743
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:19,119
bulk

744
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,919
and

745
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:24,879
what you are waiting for here is the

746
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,480
causal mutation but

747
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,960
has a

748
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,720
with a frequency of one

749
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,519
or

750
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,240
you can have a relate a linked mutation

751
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,919
but have also high frequency

752
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,880
so we did that in that case for example

753
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,759
we didn't have so many seats so we have

754
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:50,320
been working on very small population we

755
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:53,119
have been working on 100 returns 72 or 3

756
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:55,519
bc 1 f2 individuals

757
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:59,278
we scored the different phenotypes you

758
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,359
had the expected segregation where 25

759
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:04,640
percent had the fin

760
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,398
paragraph notable that go segregated

761
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,480
with ripening

762
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,838
phenotype

763
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:16,878
and then we constituted different bulks

764
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:16,878
for example analysis of different traits

765
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:24,320
principled component analysis bulk

766
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,358
and we seconds and this is what we get

767
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,679
after

768
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:30,639
sequencing so we did wood genome

769
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,960
sequencing 30 to 40 x

770
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,159
coverage and this is the different

771
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,039
chromosomes why but do not carry

772
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,159
the mutation here you can see this is

773
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,918
the

774
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,119
this is a sliding windows for ems

775
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:50,559
mutations

776
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:53,440
you can see that the curves are almost

777
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,759
at the same level in the case of mutant

778
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,480
and white up bulk

779
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,200
but in the chromosome that carries

780
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,559
mutation you have a clear and huge

781
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:06,799
difference in these frequencies

782
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,719
in some cases i will

783
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,400
i won't show you

784
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:15,039
in different museums we

785
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,639
working with larger population

786
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,559
we

787
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:23,598
ended up with

788
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,599
with the causal mutation in just one

789
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,838
one analysis in that case we had a

790
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,320
smaller population what we did is to use

791
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:38,078
we identified chromosome we had

792
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,039
different candidate regions showing this

793
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,560
snip

794
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:45,679
frequency ratio that we were waiting for

795
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:47,440
for example this one we designed using

796
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,358
the different uh

797
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,400
ems mutation

798
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,440
we designed markers which are

799
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,559
caspar

800
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,960
markers

801
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:02,000
quite easy to do and cheap to do and use

802
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,119
again same population to find map

803
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,800
mutation

804
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:10,640
and what we found actually is that this

805
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:14,000
mutation was not close to centromeric

806
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:16,639
region but it was in a recombinant

807
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,440
region which was nice

808
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,159
but

809
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,920
we didn't identify

810
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,719
and we did

811
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,760
using markers doing

812
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:31,838
analysis of recombinant and so on we

813
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,000
didn't identify any causal mutation in

814
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,838
this region

815
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,760
so

816
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:43,279
but we knew that mutation was there

817
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,640
what we did in that case is to go back

818
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,040
to the data and to look at all different

819
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:52,078
mutations because ems

820
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:55,358
actually is known to cause

821
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,320
base base transition but what we know

822
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,598
and some other groups did the same in

823
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,800
tomato

824
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,200
we know

825
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,599
but we have not only

826
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,879
base base transition we have also

827
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,599
transversions and we have also indels

828
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,358
and

829
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,599
actually

830
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:14,960
a mutation was

831
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,519
identified

832
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,800
again by looking at the

833
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:22,000
mutations

834
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,960
that were filled filtered out in the

835
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,920
first

836
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,519
step

837
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,480
and we identify

838
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,679
one

839
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,519
t

840
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,279
direction

841
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:33,039
in one

842
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,160
gene and we

843
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,759
clearly see here the frequency in the

844
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:41,118
mutant bulk

845
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,680
and in the white bug but is very close

846
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,358
to what we are waiting for

847
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:51,039
and what we did again using a different

848
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:52,319
mutation certain marker we could without

849
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,480
any

850
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,160
adopt a sign

851
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,199
per mutation this

852
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:01,920
mutant this is white up and you can

853
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,118
clearly see that this

854
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,559
mutation

855
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,720
is responsible

856
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,358
for the mutant

857
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,358
phenotype

858
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:14,400
so now

859
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:18,320
we are at this point this is very recent

860
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,440
work actually we did the second thing in

861
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,480
august or september then we analyzed

862
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,920
this and we came to bat a few weeks ago

863
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,199
and you had this

864
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,200
point uh now and actually the candidate

865
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:34,319
gene um

866
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,679
that is responsible for the phenotype

867
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,039
that you observe

868
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:40,799
is a good granulat binding protein we

869
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,358
don't know much

870
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,200
from what i've seen

871
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:48,319
on that role in plants possibly involved

872
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,480
in sea

873
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,838
cyclic gmp

874
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,800
signaling

875
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:57,759
and base may interfere with

876
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,240
other hormone signaling pathways jupiter

877
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,320
and oxyhilon

878
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:04,239
nitric oxide

879
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,119
and this is the question

880
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:08,078
we are working on the second one is

881
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,160
to be

882
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,640
absolutely sure we know that fin

883
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:15,279
pericarp is linked to this problem of

884
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:18,799
cell division using the different

885
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,280
markers larger population we want to be

886
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,359
absolutely sure that this delayed

887
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,119
ripening is due

888
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:29,519
to the same

889
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:33,119
mutation as the one responsible for that

890
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:36,159
so this is one example of a strategy

891
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,400
that was using i will just

892
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,719
talk a few minutes

893
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,680
about

894
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:47,039
another work that you have done on foot

895
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,719
critical again same strategy going

896
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,519
through database

897
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:54,159
identifying mutants but showed

898
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:55,280
a foot surface

899
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,239
appearance

900
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,079
different glossy mutants you can see

901
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,118
that they are compared to white type

902
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,400
they are more

903
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,838
shiny

904
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,320
and dull mutants

905
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:11,838
so what you have done and this is

906
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,920
the work of juan

907
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:17,039
is to identify

908
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,200
series we are not working on all of them

909
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:21,679
other glossy mutants

910
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:24,799
series of dull mutants

911
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:26,559
and analyzing these we could have some

912
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,240
ideas of the

913
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:31,119
of the

914
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:34,799
processes but control

915
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:39,280
foot shininess glossiness

916
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:42,400
and just to give you an example of how

917
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,400
interesting it can be for biotech

918
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,599
application later

919
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,000
this is

920
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,760
joan is working very well

921
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,559
but he may have some forgot some

922
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,520
tubes in the fridge what he did

923
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:59,119
and this is a white up mutant one year

924
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:00,880
after

925
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,559
being in the fridge

926
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,400
white up mutant cuticle

927
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,599
affected mutant

928
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,800
and another critical affected mutant but

929
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,280
in that case that mutant

930
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,440
still after one year

931
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,079
showed a

932
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,318
very good

933
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,359
appearance so this can be quite

934
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:28,000
interesting for looking at the

935
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,119
critical effects on shelf life and and

936
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,199
form

937
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,800
but what i want

938
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:35,838
to show you

939
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,839
is how

940
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:40,960
we

941
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:44,879
try to under identify the underlying

942
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,838
genes so as i said before this is a auto

943
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,960
pair cap you have a critical here and

944
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:53,759
cuticle is made of two main

945
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,000
polios one is curtin there were

946
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,160
boxes with different

947
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,559
components and this is

948
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:00,559
cut in

949
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,880
total cutting load on these different

950
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:10,239
mutants so you can see that in the

951
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,920
glossy mutant we have several cutting

952
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,479
deficient mutant

953
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,838
we identified the first one which

954
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,838
actually is a cutting centers for

955
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:22,719
mabel's cloning

956
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:26,799
and this one we wanted to go for

957
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:29,519
this bsa and just mapping strategy

958
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,318
so we have done that again a different

959
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:36,880
bulk in that case we have been working

960
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:41,119
with a 400 or even 600

961
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,838
bc1 f2 plant again you can clearly see

962
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,519
that

963
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:48,799
the chromosome that carries the mutation

964
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:51,199
you have a clear difference in the snip

965
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,800
frequencies

966
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:55,919
narrowed down

967
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,960
to different snips in one region

968
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,039
10 to 15 snips and again

969
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,760
we could identify

970
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,519
the snip that was present in

971
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,560
homozygous

972
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:13,599
mutant line and responsible for mutation

973
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,599
and actually what we saw is that that

974
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,880
mutation was a

975
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:22,640
glisten to arginine mutation

976
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,838
in vaccine which is a geopath glycerol

977
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,639
phosphate acid

978
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:27,679
and

979
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,559
this

980
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:34,879
mutation is very close to a domain but

981
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:36,078
is responsible for catalytic activity of

982
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,880
the enzyme

983
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,280
and you introduce a chart amino acid

984
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,039
next to this

985
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,160
to base

986
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:46,639
domain

987
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:49,440
and we think this is responsible and we

988
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:52,639
are working on that to demonstrate that

989
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,358
responsible for the loss of activity of

990
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:57,118
gpat and for the critical

991
00:43:55,358 --> 00:44:01,279
phenotype

992
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:04,640
and jpat is a well-known enzyme that is

993
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,839
involved in the synthesis of cutting

994
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:09,838
monomers

995
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:12,000
so these are just two

996
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:14,880
snapshots of

997
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,679
current work that we are doing on

998
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,920
these mutants something that is far from

999
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:19,919
being

1000
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:27,519
finished but i think it demonstrates how

1001
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,559
we can identify genes we wouldn't have

1002
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,599
think of

1003
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,440
before

1004
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,318
or neuralis for known genes but might

1005
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,400
have

1006
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,679
strong importance

1007
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,680
for

1008
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:44,318
applied aspects in

1009
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:47,519
crop printing tomato crop green

1010
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:51,358
one main advantage of these

1011
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:54,159
micro term mutants this strategy this is

1012
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,440
one table you know greenhouse and you

1013
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,799
can have

1014
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,318
one wool

1015
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,920
a population

1016
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:04,400
segregating population on four square

1017
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,280
meters so that means that

1018
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,039
you can grow them but year-round in

1019
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,880
greenhouse you can have different

1020
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:14,639
population

1021
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,440
phenotype them then go for

1022
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:18,400
for

1023
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,960
sequencing and if you are lucky if it's

1024
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,280
in a recombinant region and so on you

1025
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,599
can straight

1026
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,760
identify the the gene and you are

1027
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:32,720
currently and this against different

1028
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:35,839
mutants with high low mutants when

1029
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,879
yield is double of normal micro term

1030
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:39,759
cracking

1031
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,599
aspects vitamin c and

1032
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,480
so on

1033
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,519
and

1034
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,280
just

1035
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,800
one of the last slide

1036
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,280
you can further go and use this mutant

1037
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,800
collection for looking for allelic

1038
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,839
series in the gene that you identified

1039
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,640
before

1040
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:01,358
one example for this gene

1041
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:04,000
which is involved in carotenoid

1042
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,880
biosynthesis in the food we have

1043
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,599
isolated several mutant

1044
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,000
messenger mutations but don't cause any

1045
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,720
effect on the properly functionable

1046
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,119
protein white have phenotype and then

1047
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:20,000
missance mutation again glycine to

1048
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,720
arginine mutation throwing effect and

1049
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,599
you get the tangerine phenotype the same

1050
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:28,639
great face called mutant and in that

1051
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,800
case you accommodate a cis lycopenes

1052
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:33,440
instead of trans

1053
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,039
lycopene

1054
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,639
so

1055
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,599
i think

1056
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,799
now we begin with

1057
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,960
tomato

1058
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,640
genome sequence

1059
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,639
that is available not only for heinz but

1060
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:50,159
also for different

1061
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,920
cultivars

1062
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:55,598
with

1063
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,400
all the tools and we had a very nice

1064
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:01,440
tour with this morning the facilities

1065
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,119
here i think with the genome sequencing

1066
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,599
bioinformatics

1067
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,480
and so on we have all the tools i think

1068
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,640
in

1069
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,599
tomato to use these

1070
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,480
mutants but i think it's the same for

1071
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,400
all

1072
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:19,119
plants crop species in which we can have

1073
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,559
ems collection

1074
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,358
and next we can also use but this has

1075
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,719
been known for a while to me tilling to

1076
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:29,679
identify

1077
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,679
aliex service

1078
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,440
so i would like to

1079
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:37,200
present you the

1080
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,358
people in my group who participate in

1081
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:43,279
all of that work

1082
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:45,838
lucy is carrying out all the work on the

1083
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:50,079
fruit size mutant

1084
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:54,000
yuan that is here on the cuticle

1085
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:57,200
and daniel is somebody that is central

1086
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,639
to all mutant collection greenhouse and

1087
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:00,078
and so on

1088
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,159
and

1089
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,200
cecile

1090
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:09,118
gb and so on have been working on all

1091
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:12,000
this ngs mapping and did a very good job

1092
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:16,240
on that with virginia

1093
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,119
and martin was carrying out all the work

1094
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:20,078
on the

1095
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:22,400
basic transcription factor that i showed

1096
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,760
you at the beginning

1097
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,240
and of course

1098
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,359
we are not working alone and we have

1099
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:32,799
been working with different groups and i

1100
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:36,239
forgot for example ali for metabolom

1101
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:40,240
alifarni from maximum extruding

1102
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,439
in gold in germany for metabolism

1103
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:42,558
and so on

1104
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:48,039
so

1105
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:48,040
i wish to thank you for your attention

1106
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:05,879
this has been a production of cornell

1107
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,880
university on the web at cornell.edu
