1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,280
let me proceed I'm not going to talk

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,048
about photosynthesis much but I'm going

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,829
to talk about photosynthetic organisms

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:18,019
and their their lifestyle and

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,250
it's the

8
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:22,219
what I'm going to talk about is this

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,219
business this inning and the

10
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:29,039
Yankees time which is that

11
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:31,649
there are cells like cyanobacterial

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,579
cells that can perform these two amazing

13
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:37,590
and important energy related processes

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,600
one producing energy in the other one

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,370
utilizing energy and that's what is

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,410
interning and photos into the nitrogen

17
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,359
fixation and let me just start by saying

18
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:47,579
something that probably everybody in

19
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,070
this room knows but this is the basis

20
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,929
for this study is that photosynthesis

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,090
especially oxygenic photosynthesis

22
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:57,500
produces oxygen nitrogen fixation

23
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,630
depends on an enzyme that's exquisitely

24
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,460
sensitive to oxygen so having the two

25
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,100
things happen in the same space at the

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,978
same time or not this has been a long

27
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,780
time question that people have been

28
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:11,728
asking and what I will tell you now is

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,099
what we have learned over the last 15

30
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:16,408
years or so studying a specialized sign

31
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,809
of bacterial cells this is my favorite

32
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,859
slide always to remind myself and also

33
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,570
when I teach students is that

34
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:27,810
oxygen acuerdo synthetic photosynthesis

35
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:31,559
nature divides this amazing system long

36
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,719
time ago its carbon negative it reduces

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,240
the byproduct oxygen that we all depend

38
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,868
on and it makes good stuff like this

39
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,689
carbohydrates that's the basis for

40
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:45,930
basis for life as we know on this planet

41
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,810
and what the other thing that I want to

42
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,450
point out is that the basics machinery

43
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,478
for photosynthesis evolved in

44
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,150
cyanobacteria as far as oxygen in

45
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:00,780
photosynthesis is concerned and remain

46
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:03,330
the same over many millions years of our

47
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,879
billions of years of evolution so that

48
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,669
what we see in

49
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:11,370
implant systems the basic machinery of

50
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:14,619
photosynthesis remains the same as what

51
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,539
were what was what evolved into a sign

52
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,549
bacteriol system so what are

53
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:21,429
cyanobacteria I am assuming that

54
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:25,090
majority of the folks here are our plant

55
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,920
biologists so cyanobacteria are microbes

56
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,450
they are prokaryotes oxygen equal

57
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:31,030
synthetic flow carriers they are the

58
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:33,009
progenitors of chloroplasts most

59
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,419
abundant fossils in precambrian drugs

60
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:36,939
they have been around for many billion

61
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:39,068
years and found everywhere on the planet

62
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:40,810
what is going to be important today is

63
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:42,189
this feature that they are the only

64
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,590
known bacteria which circadian

65
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:45,989
lifestyles and this will play an

66
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,750
important role

67
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:53,079
in what I'm going to discuss today now

68
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,299
cyanobacteria I'm just going to coat

69
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:58,359
stiff and your Gold's book up live from

70
00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:00,519
that it says that the 2.5 to 2 billion

71
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:02,799
years ago cyanobacteria thrive by using

72
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,450
water the most abundant source of

73
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,799
hydrogen in the environment and oxygen

74
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:08,078
was a byproduct but here is the

75
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,239
important sentence life began to change

76
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:15,510
the planet the planet the way we know it

77
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:18,340
the the the oxic environment it

78
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:21,039
primarily the cyanobacteria responsible

79
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,560
for it one of the consequence was this

80
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,019
business of all iron two-plus becoming

81
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,930
iron three-plus precipitate the ocean

82
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:31,900
bottom basically for biology this is a

83
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:34,769
big conundrum because with the basic

84
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,719
machinery of life was

85
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,159
was dependent on iron two-plus but then

86
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:42,098
all of a sudden we don't have any of

87
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:44,979
that and everybody including human

88
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:46,828
beings we have to invent all sorts of

89
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:49,869
ways of capturing

90
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:52,900
iron and using it the appropriate level

91
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,819
and then nearly over a billion years

92
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,069
oxygen they will build up dissolve in

93
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,988
water is kept in the atmosphere 20.6

94
00:03:57,068 --> 00:04:01,509
percent sometimes it was even higher and

95
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:04,480
stage was set for the evolution of

96
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:06,969
eukaryotes without this this this

97
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,888
probably would not have happened so gold

98
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:10,419
says tiny organisms that exploited a

99
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:12,310
wealth of co2 water and sunlight

100
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:15,160
transformed the art so these are

101
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,538
cyanobacteria they look like this wide

102
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:18,699
variety of habitats they are

103
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:21,819
morphologically diverse and some can

104
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:24,009
also fix nitrogen what I show here those

105
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:27,800
are supposed to be micron those were

106
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:30,469
that the mac to pc conversion so they

107
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,180
can be very large like 10 micron

108
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:36,440
bacterial cells and unicellular

109
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,959
whereas they can also be in filamentous

110
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:41,000
phase like in anabaena a system that has

111
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:45,408
been studied the three in the bottom are

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,839
the one that can fix nitrogen cynical

113
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:49,310
sister 6803 that's the war cards that we

114
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:53,329
have been working on for more than 30

115
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:56,500
years now that does not know how to fix

116
00:04:53,329 --> 00:05:00,889
nitrogen I'm going to compare in my

117
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:04,129
this one with that one sino tc5 1142 and

118
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:06,110
6803 those two numbers that will come up

119
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:08,090
over and over again and you will know

120
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,788
what I'm talking about this one cannot

121
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:13,218
fix nitrogen this one can but both of

122
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:15,288
those are photosynthetic oxygen equal to

123
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:17,120
synthetic organism so let's go into sino

124
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:20,209
t see what I'm going to describe to you

125
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,538
is a project that has been ongoing for

126
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:27,198
more than 15 years now with this class

127
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:28,389
of organisms now let me go back and

128
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,848
point out something

129
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:34,098
when nitrogen fixation takes place in a

130
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:36,918
photosynthetic organisms as I pointed

131
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:39,259
out one has to separate out the two

132
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:41,478
processes the process of oxygen

133
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:44,270
production and the process of nitrogen

134
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:47,360
fixation because the two are the yin and

135
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:48,859
the yang as I mentioned now organisms

136
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,658
have developed two different strategies

137
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,028
to do that it's easy to understand one

138
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:55,519
is over space and that's this this kind

139
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:57,110
of filament the cells that are smaller

140
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,939
there those are the vegetative cells

141
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,250
where photosynthesis is taking place of

142
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:03,228
cells that are larger are the heterosis

143
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,629
cells where nitrogen fixation is taking

144
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:07,968
place so the two kinds of cells and

145
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:09,158
elaborate developmental processes that

146
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:11,658
are taking place

147
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:14,139
has been very well studied over the

148
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:18,680
years this is separating out the

149
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:20,060
two processes in space in contrast what

150
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,978
you will see is that these kinds of

151
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,709
single-cell organisms that fix nitrogen

152
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:27,258
single-serve cyanobacteria they separate

153
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:29,089
out the processes in time and this is of

154
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:30,830
interest here and that's what the

155
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:33,829
circadian rhythm business comes into

156
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:35,300
play okay so cyano TC again here are the

157
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:36,889
different kinds of scientists am NOT

158
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,689
going to spend a lot of time

159
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:40,879
they have been isolated from various

160
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:44,990
parts of the world the what one that we

161
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,669
work on primarily Phi 1142 that was

162
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,189
isolated by Lucian man's Lab at Purdue

163
00:06:46,668 --> 00:06:52,459
when they went out to port aransas in

164
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:55,430
Texas so these are from benthic water

165
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:57,799
and they are also found in open ocean

166
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:01,340
and very interesting stories that are

167
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,699
developing in how those sino tc's

168
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:06,739
operate in the open ocean okay now what

169
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,879
I want to point out here is that you

170
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,848
know it's the phylogenetic relationships

171
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,550
I know TC nowadays it's easy to sequence

172
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:15,680
the genome any any given evening you can

173
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,240
sequence a bacterial genome and you have

174
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,069
tons and tons of data and then you run

175
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,379
them through pipelines and then you find

176
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:24,710
out all kinds of things this is some

177
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:27,528
years ago in 2011 you're a majority of

178
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:30,500
the ones that were known and what I show

179
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:33,139
here is that cyano TC again that 51 142

180
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,060
and here is the other one that does not

181
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,158
know how to fix night what should be

182
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,949
very clear here is that the two are very

183
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:42,050
closely related in this whole scheme of

184
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:44,210
the things I'll come back to this this

185
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,400
notion in contrast there are other

186
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:50,120
cyanobacteria species like this cynical

187
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:52,250
caucus they are quite distant from a

188
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,658
phylogenetic point of view okay and this

189
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,478
will play an important role so let's

190
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:57,550
talk about 511 42 and what is an

191
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,468
approach that

192
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,569
is being called now it is systems

193
00:08:00,468 --> 00:08:04,519
biology which is looking at all things

194
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:07,819
that happen in the cells we used to call

195
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:09,709
this thing physiology in the past so so

196
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:11,509
that's that's what we are we are going

197
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:13,158
to go into but in much more detail and

198
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:15,080
with an approach that takes into account

199
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:19,278
the entire genome and its associated

200
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:21,948
functions ok so it's unicellular and fix

201
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:24,439
this nitrogen diurnal rhythm results in

202
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:26,120
numerous intracellular changes and in

203
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:27,830
this electron micrograph what I want to

204
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,079
show you is what a cyanobacterial cell

205
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:32,328
looks like it's a typical gram-negative

206
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,848
bacterium has an outer envelope player

207
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:38,569
with the plasma membrane and outer

208
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:40,969
membrane and inside is this whole

209
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,379
elaborate network of membranes that the

210
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,629
thylakoid membranes that the same kind

211
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:46,850
of straw membrane system that's

212
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:48,750
presently in chloroplasts and then it

213
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,210
has all kinds of other things in

214
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,399
intracellular

215
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,259
body one that is being studied at this

216
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,870
institution very much is this one called

217
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:59,789
carboxy zone where carbon fixation takes

218
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,379
place and so on okay so let me first

219
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,329
show you the cellular ultrastructure

220
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:05,700
Michele libertine when as a graduate

221
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,800
student did this study and it's a 2

222
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,810
nanometer tomographic sliced images that

223
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,669
show the intercellular details showing

224
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:15,799
the thylakoid membranes how they are

225
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:19,049
laid down and G here is glycogen

226
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:21,059
bodies or glycogen storage bodies see is

227
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:23,129
carboxy zone and so all of these are

228
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:26,009
shown and these are our individual

229
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:27,629
slices shown one after another when you

230
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:30,539
put those two together this is what you

231
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:32,009
see there is a there is a movie

232
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,110
associated with it but I will not go

233
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:36,539
into the complication is again mac to pc

234
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:40,129
conversion but what you see here is this

235
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:43,909
elaborate description this is still the

236
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:46,950
the largest or the most detailed

237
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:47,689
description of a cyanobacterial cell to

238
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,520
date

239
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:53,910
basically what it shows the entire cell

240
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:56,509
this is a cutout and it's full with

241
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:58,588
those green colored pseudo coloured

242
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:00,588
membrane system that's the thylakoid

243
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:04,050
membrane so if you look at that cell

244
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,730
that a typically coli cell and a typical

245
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:07,559
cyanobacteria cell that will be the

246
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,899
distinguishing feature the intercellular

247
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,000
membrane system that's Tyler Cloyd also

248
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:14,370
we counted numbers so there are 21

249
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,159
peroxisomes and so on and so forth okay

250
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,759
all right so this is what a

251
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,679
cyanobacterial cell looks like

252
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:25,860
okay so now let's go into the business

253
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,989
of dynamics or rhythms what happens to

254
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,000
these cells

255
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:32,960
under alternating light dark conditions

256
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,070
I'm going to stay away from

257
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,110
considerations of circadian rhythm

258
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,580
that's a set of studies that I'm not

259
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,740
going to talk about there are some

260
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,170
subtle differences between diurnal

261
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,610
rhythms and circadian rhythm studies but

262
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:46,949
if anybody is interested I'll be happy

263
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,289
to discuss that later on so diurnal

264
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:52,430
rhythms we set up experiments that are

265
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:56,909
very very simple it requires

266
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:59,759
12 hours of light that's the L side the

267
00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:02,750
left side and 12 hours of darkness that

268
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,309
move side on the right side and

269
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:09,659
basically the first thing to observe is

270
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:11,639
that when we look at it specific time

271
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:14,250
points during the light period in the

272
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,559
dark beer and we measure photosynthesis

273
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,779
here is darkness here is light and what

274
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,729
you see is that that capacity of

275
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:22,889
photosynthesis goes down dramatically

276
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,409
during the dark period and it comes back

277
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:27,629
up during the light period and in

278
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:30,629
contrast nitrogen fixation takes place

279
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:33,090
exclusively in the dark period okay

280
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:35,279
that's thus the temporal of separation

281
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,710
of the two processes so basically what

282
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,600
we did in those early days is take

283
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,430
samples every two hours which means that

284
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,370
there are a whole bunch of undergraduate

285
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:46,199
students who have lose their circadian

286
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,399
rhythms and they collect all of these

287
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:54,720
samples and what was interesting is that

288
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:55,919
this system is so robust is that you

289
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,500
know looking at the data you can

290
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,659
immediately say okay you know this

291
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,240
person at two o'clock in the morning did

292
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:05,490
not take the right sample because of the

293
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,889
oscillations that take place in various

294
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,600
things that you saw so anyway so

295
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:11,429
collecting those samples and those

296
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,590
samples were then used in a variety of

297
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:16,379
the same samples were used in a variety

298
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,389
of omics level studies so to say but

299
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:19,919
first let me show you what happens to

300
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:22,230
the organization of the thylakoid

301
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,990
between light and dark this is in dot

302
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,930
darkness d ten that's ten hours into

303
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:30,299
darkness this is el 10 this is light ten

304
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:32,819
hours and what you see is that here the

305
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:36,000
thylakoid membranes they are relative

306
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,710
orientations change but two different

307
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,450
kinds of intracellular bodies that are

308
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:44,100
present here is glycogen granule that

309
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,690
accumulate during the light phase

310
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,090
because that's where active

311
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,920
photosynthesis is taking place and the

312
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,740
carbon is getting stored in the form of

313
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:55,519
glycogen in the dark phase as you will

314
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,649
see in a few minutes that glycogen is

315
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,620
broken down that's actually the engine

316
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:04,169
that drives nitrogen fixation and the

317
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,970
nitrogen that's fixed goes into this

318
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:08,519
bodies that are called cyano fising

319
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:12,310
granules and that's the storage

320
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,730
area for our the volume for the fixed

321
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:17,019
nitrogen which is subsequently used in

322
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:20,560
biosynthesis during the following day so

323
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:22,689
it's a going over and over again through

324
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,149
these processes in a periodic diagonal

325
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,500
manner so it's a beautiful system and as

326
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:28,090
I have mentioned photosynthesis and

327
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,090
nitrogen fixation are separated

328
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:34,540
temporarily in the same cell okay so now

329
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:36,550
comes into now looking at all different

330
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:38,769
kinds of molecules I'm going to spend a

331
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:42,509
lot of time on transcriptomics but we

332
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:44,620
have done transcript protein metabolites

333
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:46,629
post-translational modifications all of

334
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,789
those but basically with the same

335
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:51,250
samples so that we can compare the

336
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:52,509
different omics level data one with the

337
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,940
other so let's talk about

338
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:56,379
transcriptomics

339
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:59,140
well the first thing is that nitrogen is

340
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:01,809
gene cluster night rod nitrogenous this

341
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:04,689
enzyme is large it requires a few

342
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:06,669
protein that are that are components of

343
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:09,490
the nitrogenous enzymes but it also

344
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:11,229
requires all sorts of very unusual

345
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,080
cofactors the details of which we are

346
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,149
beginning to understand and for to

347
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,950
synthesize and insert all of those

348
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:20,980
cofactors into nitrogen is there is a

349
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:23,590
large set of genes that that are

350
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,149
necessary and in many bacteria by the

351
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:27,460
way bacteria archaea are the only

352
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:29,620
organisms only pro carriers can fix

353
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,379
nitrogen there is no you carry or death

354
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:35,259
known that can fix nitrogen so in sino

355
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:38,019
tc5 1142 there is this large set of

356
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:40,319
contiguous genes in gene clusters a

357
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:42,789
whole said that's

358
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,670
looking left word and a whole set that's

359
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:47,379
looking right word all together 35 genes

360
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:49,629
i will come back to this business of 35

361
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:51,279
genes and different sino tc's have

362
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:54,279
practically the same type of

363
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,230
organization of the NIF cluster okay so

364
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,949
let's first look at the expression

365
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:02,259
profiles at the transcript level of all

366
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:05,710
of these genes and what we found is

367
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:07,210
really very tight coordinate control of

368
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,220
the expression at the transcriptional

369
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:12,040
level let me describe this to you this

370
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,800
is a law of 2 ratio and there is a 7 I'm

371
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:17,909
sorry 9 log difference between the top

372
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:20,939
of that and the bottom of that okay this

373
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:24,208
is dark period this is like period again

374
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,160
dark and this is this is light okay so

375
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:28,500
all of these genes are getting

376
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,889
coordinate lee controlled coming all

377
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,559
from this cluster of this 28,000 base

378
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:37,559
pair chunk of DNA that's present in sino

379
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,929
TC and you can see how tightly they are

380
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,879
controlled we have continued these

381
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:44,489
experiments in subsequent years for many

382
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:47,730
many days and that does not die away so

383
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,528
it's very carefully control okay now if

384
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:54,750
we take the all of the transcriptome

385
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:56,549
data and we do modeling on those by

386
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,159
doing very simple Pearson correlation

387
00:15:56,549 --> 00:16:02,189
coefficients and looking at what are the

388
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:04,500
different genes that have the same kind

389
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:07,290
of expression profile over a diurnal

390
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,159
behavior then you come up we came up

391
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:13,199
with this this kind of a

392
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,990
model that that we call this a read

393
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,339
model okay

394
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,519
what let me describe this these are

395
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:22,440
different time points dark one hour five

396
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,980
hour nine hours this is light one hour

397
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,410
five hour nine hours red is

398
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,170
up-regulation four times and this this

399
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:33,838
faint blue color is 16 times

400
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:37,139
downregulation ok now let's look at this

401
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,290
area all of these actually show all the

402
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:41,189
genes that are present in a

403
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:45,389
cyanobacterium in this case the sine of

404
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:48,120
T c-51 142 so every dot represents the

405
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:50,129
transcription level for every gene okay

406
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,379
and that's invariant in or in this

407
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:55,139
structure what is variant are the levels

408
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:56,759
of expression so in the darkness what I

409
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,328
say energy metabolism basically

410
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,909
respiration that's coming up first

411
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:06,119
followed by nitrogen fixation but they

412
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:09,299
also go down to at the end of the dark

413
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,729
period what comes up is this region

414
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,799
that's photosynthesis the lights it's

415
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:17,220
lighting up and it is riding up really

416
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:19,438
high here but that also goes down during

417
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,370
the light period toward the latter part

418
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,560
of the light so this is not just the

419
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:26,839
presence of light or darkness but a care

420
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,750
food programming inside the cell that

421
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,579
determines the transcriptional profiles

422
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,640
of every gene that's present in this

423
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:36,710
organism and

424
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,509
based on those data this is only based

425
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,700
on the transcriptional profile I want to

426
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:42,859
emphasize that we came up with this

427
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,210
course cellular model of the processes

428
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:46,699
that are taking place inside the

429
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,250
cyanobacterial cell and it's again very

430
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,630
simple in this diagram on the left I

431
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,359
show all the things that are happening

432
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:55,220
in the light this is summing up the

433
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,859
metabolic processes that are taking

434
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,000
place and the right right part are all

435
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:01,309
the things that are happening in the

436
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,599
darkness let me describe this to you

437
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:06,049
even though this is a photosynthetic

438
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:08,899
organisms this bugs actually is very

439
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:11,359
active also in the darkness that's the

440
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,450
bottom line of this thing as it one

441
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,979
expects for the synthesis meaning both

442
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,620
the photo part the electron transfer

443
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,180
processes as well as the synthesis part

444
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:22,429
the carbon fixation processes are

445
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,820
extraordinarily highly active in this

446
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:27,830
part the carbon gets fixed and stored in

447
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:30,230
glycogen as I mentioned and in the

448
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:32,329
darkness then the glycogen is degraded

449
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,849
the glycogen degradation pathway turns

450
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:36,769
on and then restoration comes up at a

451
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:38,539
very high level that takes away all the

452
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:40,490
oxygen from inside the cells we have

453
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:42,799
direct measurements of these and then

454
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,140
nitrogen fixation takes place but it's

455
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,049
not just nitrogen fixation many many

456
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,730
processes such as hydrogen production

457
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:53,539
hydrogenous things like that are also

458
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:57,819
controlled in the same way so at in this

459
00:18:53,539 --> 00:19:01,700
period of time the inside of the cell is

460
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:03,529
relatively anoxic and that's the unusual

461
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,990
and special feature of this kind of

462
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:09,109
cyanobacterial cells and then amino acid

463
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:11,509
biosynthesis happens here the extra

464
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:13,639
nitrogen is stowed away in sign of icing

465
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:16,369
and it goes back and this continues to

466
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,770
happen over and over and over again so

467
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:20,839
the diurnal cycle summarizing that

468
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:23,179
photosynthesis results in oxygen

469
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:25,189
production during the day high rates of

470
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:27,320
respiration generated low intracellular

471
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,870
oxygen tension during early night hours

472
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,759
and oxygen sensitive enzymes such as

473
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:33,759
nitrogenous can then function in the

474
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:37,579
same himself okay

475
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,289
since class is my host I thought that I

476
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:41,359
should at least touch on the next topic

477
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,609
which is proteomics as I said we have

478
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,399
done

479
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:48,409
this interrogation at different levels

480
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:53,019
now we all know after many years of

481
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:56,690
systems biology that mapping one

482
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:58,759
omics level map onto another omics level

483
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:01,610
map still remains a challenging thing

484
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,980
and and that's simply because from very

485
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:06,199
basic biology there is no reason to

486
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,048
believe that what happens at the

487
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,120
transcription level will be essentially

488
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:12,859
followed at the level of all the

489
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,719
post-transcriptional translation and

490
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:16,490
false translation event so we were

491
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,829
interested in seeing what is the level

492
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:21,200
of correlation between the diurnal

493
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:23,418
oscillations or if there is any diurnal

494
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,789
oscillation so same kind of experiments

495
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:27,350
it required a little bit more time we

496
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:29,869
did this experiments in collaboration

497
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:31,399
with Dick Smith and colleagues at pnnl

498
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:33,709
and in those days these were really

499
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,929
challenging experiments it kind of tells

500
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,240
you what we have done but basically the

501
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:39,740
same thing every two hours we we collect

502
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,630
the sample the same samples that were

503
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,490
used for transcriptomics and this is

504
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,410
what the cycling patterns of the

505
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,929
proteins look like same kind of color

506
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:51,220
scheme okay so the first thing to notice

507
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:54,200
is that that the reed is not that dense

508
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,808
so don't not that many proteins at the

509
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,960
level of detection that we had are

510
00:20:55,808 --> 00:21:03,220
oscillating in their in their absolute

511
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,259
protein levels and

512
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,360
but the overall story is the same again

513
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:10,819
photosynthesis comes out during light

514
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:14,240
and nitrogen fixation comes up in the in

515
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:16,369
the dark time and here is a description

516
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,679
of what happens at an overall protein

517
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:20,839
level and we did this experiment this

518
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:23,298
was at that time a super expensive

519
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:26,689
experiment to do all these things over

520
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:29,329
all these time points but we decided to

521
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,500
do it at least for two cycles to just to

522
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:33,210
see what is repeatable and just by

523
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,430
looking at the profile you can see that

524
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:39,769
the same kind of profile more or less is

525
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:42,240
emerging day after day and so

526
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:43,889
251 proteins exhibited measure of

527
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,930
measurable oscillations in their

528
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:48,330
abundance under alternative light dark

529
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,910
conditions who are they we go in through

530
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:53,429
there and basically without looking at

531
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,470
the details basically 25% of them belong

532
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,420
to central intermediary metabolic

533
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,559
pathway and nineteen percent are

534
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,050
involved in photosynthesis and

535
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:05,879
respiration these are proteins whose

536
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:08,359
absolute amounts are changing over the

537
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,890
light-dark cycle

538
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:13,109
but let's go back to nitrogen is not and

539
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,930
here is again something really really

540
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:18,629
interesting here the transcript levels

541
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:21,420
of all of the genes I show only the

542
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,490
structural game sniff hdk and other two

543
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:27,120
other genes just to make it simple and

544
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:29,190
see how they have very tightly

545
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:32,699
controlled a single peak in the middle

546
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:34,470
of the dark period but during the dark

547
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,539
period it also goes down and I'm

548
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:39,480
emphasizing this because there's a story

549
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:41,879
behind that that we do not have much

550
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,299
idea about it but biology does it this

551
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,470
way it does not there is a program that

552
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:48,569
determines that things will come up

553
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,089
during a period of time and then things

554
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:53,429
will go down during the same apparent

555
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:55,559
dark period or light period here is what

556
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:58,529
happens with the proteins and as you can

557
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,599
see it's the proteins are also getting

558
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:02,430
degraded they get synthesized and but

559
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,769
they get degraded during the night time

560
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,830
and their levels are extraordinarily low

561
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:10,529
in the light period also there are

562
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:12,029
binary oscillation profiles if anybody's

563
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:15,119
interested we can talk about that those

564
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:18,000
are interesting stories by themselves so

565
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,250
during the scion tc diurnal cycle the

566
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,750
regulation of nitrogenous the NIF genes

567
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,789
are expressed during the dark period

568
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:27,529
need structural proteins are synthesized

569
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:31,500
during the dark period we have done

570
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:33,119
dynamic proteomics which shows that the

571
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,210
new proteins are degraded during late

572
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,219
dark hours and in those studies what we

573
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,019
find is that post translational

574
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,700
modifications important I don't have

575
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,400
time to go through that we'll be happy

576
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,450
to discuss that later on with you and

577
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,320
nitrogenous assembles and functions

578
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:50,809
during early and middle dark hours ok

579
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:54,869
now comes the yang

580
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:58,200
remember the same cell is also

581
00:23:54,869 --> 00:24:00,659
photosynthesizing and so the question

582
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,039
that we asked is it just darkness that

583
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:06,990
turns off photosynthesis or are there

584
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:09,559
extra exquisite control elements that

585
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:13,829
are present in the organism that

586
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:16,589
makes sure that oxygen is not evolved

587
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:18,659
when nitrogenous is functioning and what

588
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:20,309
I will tell you is again a snapshot of

589
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:23,130
only one of many things that are

590
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:25,919
happening exactly in that way we're thus

591
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:28,290
there is cellular control in protecting

592
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,350
the nitrogenous from accidental

593
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:33,180
production of oxygen from

594
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:35,759
from photosystem 2 that the oxygen

595
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,650
producer so in photosynthesis for the

596
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,629
system to is the enzyme that produces

597
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:44,790
oxygen we know a lot about this system

598
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:47,010
class just just reminded me of those

599
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:49,200
early days when we did not even know how

600
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:50,879
to isolate these things and then over

601
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,330
the years it has gone gone to the stage

602
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,220
where we haven't 1.9 angstrom resolution

603
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:58,710
structure that looks like this and all I

604
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,980
can say is that ps2 complex is extremely

605
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:04,860
complex it has lots of proteins but and

606
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,210
it has also lots of cofactors the ones

607
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:08,629
that are important here that I'm

608
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:12,120
pointing out here are for manganese ions

609
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,970
we have known from early studies in sign

610
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:16,679
up with sign of bacterial cells with

611
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,490
people like George shenae from the 1960s

612
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,990
where they have I looked at

613
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,880
how manganese gets inserted in

614
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,400
photosystem 2 how that gets functional

615
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,500
and so on and so forth now the reason i

616
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,450
pointed out manganese is that at the

617
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,789
center this is a cartoon diagram that

618
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:35,100
simplifies that very complex structure

619
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:38,089
at the heart of photosystem 2 are these

620
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:42,029
two proteins d1 and d2

621
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:44,928
d1 is the protein that plays important

622
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:47,450
role in coordinating those manganese

623
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:50,119
atoms in photosystem 2 and those

624
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,489
manganese atoms are absolutely necessary

625
00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:55,848
for the oxygen evolution activity of

626
00:25:52,489 --> 00:25:58,548
photosystem 2 okay so long story short

627
00:25:55,848 --> 00:26:01,069
if you cannot bind the photosystem 2

628
00:25:58,548 --> 00:26:03,009
cannot bind manganese you take away that

629
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:05,898
possibility of

630
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:07,429
oxygen production by photosystem 2 if

631
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:10,248
there is a little bit of light around

632
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:12,609
okay because a little bit of oxygen is

633
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:15,889
enough to kill nitrogenous

634
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:18,048
so do you want protein that's encoded by

635
00:26:15,888 --> 00:26:20,808
this gene called PS behaves well known

636
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:22,398
gene provides many critical ligands for

637
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:23,898
the manganese cluster that is at the

638
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:24,998
heart of water splitting and oxygen

639
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:28,878
evolution

640
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:33,829
PSB a has five copies in sine of T C Phi

641
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:36,788
1142 and out of this five only one that

642
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:39,460
we call PS be a 4 that's

643
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:43,638
just a nomenclature

644
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:45,499
all of the other four are expressed

645
00:26:43,638 --> 00:26:48,168
highly during the light period which is

646
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:50,058
where the function okay so here is light

647
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:52,190
and those red lines actually shows the

648
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:53,838
sum total of all the four genes of how

649
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,969
they behave at the transcriptional level

650
00:26:53,838 --> 00:26:57,648
we notice there is a fifth copy this

651
00:26:55,969 --> 00:27:01,700
psba for that's behaving just the

652
00:26:57,648 --> 00:27:04,238
opposite okay that the red one is the

653
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,739
one that's psba for the other ones are

654
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:08,499
the black ones are the ones that are the

655
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:11,838
normal p is VA

656
00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:14,868
so we said this is kind of strange why

657
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:16,668
is a d1 protein being expressed in the

658
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:18,108
darkness that has no business of being

659
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:19,849
expressed at that time because

660
00:27:18,108 --> 00:27:21,769
photosystem 2 is non-functional at that

661
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:24,999
time it became clear when we sequence

662
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:28,519
the g protein and the protein part

663
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:30,440
there are specific amino acid residues

664
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,598
that we know from that crystal structure

665
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,149
that an involved in ligation of the

666
00:27:32,598 --> 00:27:36,618
manganese cluster and nature has done

667
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:39,258
that beautiful site-specific mutagenesis

668
00:27:36,618 --> 00:27:42,319
experiments some many many billion years

669
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:45,079
ago in sino t see where each and every

670
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:48,138
one of those residues are taken out and

671
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:50,509
replaced by things that in the 1980s and

672
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:52,398
90s many of us were involved in doing

673
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:55,909
site-specific mutagenesis to find out

674
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:58,529
which residue change gives rise to non

675
00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:01,770
ligation manganese so long story short

676
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:04,289
we recapitulate at this in cynical

677
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:08,490
sisters by taking this gene from cyano

678
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:11,789
tcp SBA for expressing it in a cynic

679
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:14,700
assistance 6803 cell that does not have

680
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:17,569
any psba gene and what we find is that

681
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,519
that one the one who's shown with red

682
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:23,159
cannot be a students form but it cannot

683
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,319
produce oxygen this is expected but we

684
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,769
show it show it this way whereas if we

685
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,259
take one of those other genes the psv a

686
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:32,519
one then

687
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:35,250
introduction of that into San into

688
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:37,200
synechocystis allows for resistant to to

689
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:39,690
function so what I'm telling you here is

690
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,240
that here is again and control system

691
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,250
now why do you need in the darkness and

692
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,349
then the other thing that I must mention

693
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,990
that when we looked at this specific

694
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:51,299
form of psba that has these amino acid

695
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,099
replacements they are present in many

696
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,750
dies of traffic sign of bacterial

697
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:56,969
strains and the list has grown

698
00:28:54,750 --> 00:29:00,650
tremendously since we publish this thing

699
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:04,890
and we call it the same teen ld1

700
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:08,280
because it is a way of the cells making

701
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:10,710
sure that oxygen is not evolved now why

702
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,289
is this important and this was something

703
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,910
that was

704
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:16,829
discovered by Kim Wagner who was a

705
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,350
former graduate student now now works at

706
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:22,609
a local company

707
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:26,939
she said well what the

708
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:30,479
the intensity of moonlight in a full

709
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:33,559
moon night and cyanobacteria are growing

710
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,000
on the surface of the pond and did the

711
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:37,859
simulation in the lab and basically

712
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,920
there is enough oxygen there that kills

713
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,990
nitrogenous activity in cyano TC under

714
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,820
those conditions is that the real

715
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,620
natural reasons we don't know but that's

716
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:49,319
one of the reasons probably the sign of

717
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:52,829
actually go to this extreme control

718
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:55,250
systems where they make sure that for

719
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:59,929
the system to is not

720
00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:03,200
it is a functional at time by putting in

721
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:06,320
this strange copy of d1 protein that

722
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,980
cannot function as a manganese ligation

723
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:11,990
protein so we envisioned we have some

724
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,809
proof but not definitive proof of this

725
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:16,549
entire model we are working on that

726
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:18,500
basically in the darkness dissociation

727
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:21,230
of some other proteins and synthesis and

728
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,650
insertion of sd1 that the sentinel d1

729
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:27,289
and then remove all of SD one insertion

730
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,759
of d1 when light comes up these are

731
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:31,009
challenging experiments but we have

732
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:33,769
initial evidence that this is the way

733
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:35,720
scion tc is operating so this is the

734
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:37,519
Inge and the yang how much time do I

735
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,220
have do I have about five minutes or so

736
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:43,220
ok alright so let me just go into the

737
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:45,829
next phase of another challenging set of

738
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,319
experiments that we have embarked on now

739
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:49,730
it has been now close to three years now

740
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,519
that we have been involved in this and

741
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,620
this is the the project has to do with

742
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:57,410
designing nitrogen-fixing ability in

743
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:59,119
oxygen in photosynthetic cells and the

744
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:01,040
background that I provided to you with

745
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,599
the scientist and cynical sister systems

746
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,279
will make it easier for you to

747
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:08,779
understand where we want to go with this

748
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:11,480
this is an evolving story it's a it's a

749
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:14,299
collaborative one where costas Morales

750
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,279
is a computational scientist in a trap

751
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:18,799
Penn State and then two of my synthetic

752
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:20,660
biology colleagues in the engineering

753
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:25,099
school of washington university web

754
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:26,110
teamed up to do this well why even get

755
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:28,609
into this

756
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:31,309
that's because nitrogen is an essential

757
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:33,709
nutrient for plant growth and a

758
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:35,779
long-term goal of this nitrogen program

759
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:38,090
is to endow plant cells with nitrogen

760
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:41,869
fixing ability this is the big goal that

761
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:43,279
ever of people are interested in and as

762
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:45,469
I mentioned photosynthesis in plants

763
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,700
produce oxygen important inhibitor of

764
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,339
nitrogenous but on the other hand

765
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,950
nitrogenous needs a lot of energy so you

766
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:53,899
cannot put nitrogenous in a tissue that

767
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:56,090
does not have enough energy source it

768
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,130
will not be able to fix nitrogen so how

769
00:31:56,089 --> 00:32:00,409
do you deal with this so the overall

770
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:02,600
goal for our systems and synthetic

771
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:05,750
biology approaches is to develop the

772
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:07,668
design principles to establish

773
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,339
nitrogen-fixing ability in the

774
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:12,559
unicellular cyanobacterium synechocystis

775
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:14,240
6803 and the knowledge base that's

776
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,009
created in this project will be directly

777
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,120
applicable to engineer nitrogen-fixing

778
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:22,128
craft plans we hope okay alright so so

779
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:23,808
this is kind of a schematic diagram of

780
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:26,048
what we are talking about we want to

781
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:29,628
make in nitrogen-fixing crop plant

782
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:31,759
there are two ways to do that one is to

783
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:33,678
engineer nitrogen-fixing symbiosis for

784
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,778
crop plants just like soybean does it

785
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,960
the other one is putting nitrogen-fixing

786
00:32:35,778 --> 00:32:42,019
module directly into the photosynthetic

787
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,999
tissues of the plant okay so one way to

788
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:46,460
think about it is that we just heard all

789
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:48,288
these things about sino TC 5114 to just

790
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:52,308
change for all that entire machinery

791
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:54,288
into plans this is challenging so we did

792
00:32:52,308 --> 00:32:56,749
not even approach this instead we said

793
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:59,749
let's just take a shortcut and let's try

794
00:32:56,749 --> 00:33:01,100
to figure out that the the principles

795
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:04,190
that are involved in putting in

796
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:05,959
nitrogenous into an oxygen environment

797
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:09,110
in an organism that does not know how to

798
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,480
fix nitrogen so we go to our good old

799
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:15,528
friend synechocystis and we want to

800
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:17,149
transfer the nitrogenous program not

801
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:19,069
just the genes and proteins but the

802
00:33:17,148 --> 00:33:21,589
program itself all of it into

803
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:23,349
synechocystis makes in ecosystems that's

804
00:33:21,589 --> 00:33:25,939
dies or trophic and

805
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:27,888
then the design principles presumably in

806
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,389
some future years will be used for

807
00:33:27,888 --> 00:33:32,599
making this nitrogen fixing plan that's

808
00:33:29,388 --> 00:33:35,028
the basic thing okay so we chose these

809
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:36,648
two organisms simply again being back

810
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:38,659
that they are phylogenetically very

811
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:40,579
closely related in many ways sinica

812
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:42,320
sisters is a nitrogen fixing

813
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:43,999
cyanobacterium which has lost its

814
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,970
ability to fix nitrogen that's the way

815
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:48,710
people have described it in papers that

816
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,329
describe that the phylogenetic

817
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,009
relationship and our goal is to

818
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:54,288
establish in synechocystis the nitrogen

819
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:56,409
fixation circuitry normally present new

820
00:33:54,288 --> 00:33:59,210
scion tc what i'm going to tell you in

821
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:02,059
two minutes is that the first phase of

822
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,950
it is over because we have been able to

823
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:06,888
now this was the biggest challenge at

824
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:09,530
the beginning of the project is this 35

825
00:34:06,888 --> 00:34:13,029
genes in nif cluster put all of these in

826
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:16,099
a move them from sino TC into

827
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:19,050
synechocystis and there are new

828
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:22,019
technique that are used by the synthetic

829
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:25,500
biologists that allows us to do this so

830
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:28,710
we we could take we could use a method

831
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,179
called DNA assembler that again the

832
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,710
details are not important here but if

833
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,590
anybody's interested I will be happy to

834
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:37,380
discuss that and very quickly first of

835
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:40,380
all put together an e.coli first in East

836
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:43,500
and then in e.coli this large plasmid

837
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:47,420
that's about 40 kilobase fear that has

838
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:51,420
all the genes here exactly in the way

839
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:53,400
cyano TC has it we decided to take this

840
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:56,250
approach rather than the traditional

841
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,930
synthetic biology approaches that Chris

842
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,869
void and colleagues are doing which is

843
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:03,000
first taking apart every gene putting in

844
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:05,009
control circuits on them and putting it

845
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,449
back together and make it work we

846
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,190
thought that we are not clever enough to

847
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:10,589
do that so just borrow the whole thing

848
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:13,110
from a cyanobacterial cells move it into

849
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:15,600
a cyanobacterial cells it took a little

850
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:18,420
bit of time but we could transfer all of

851
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,739
this into synechocystis and for the last

852
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,670
two years this thing is stable

853
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:25,009
replicating in synechocystis

854
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,269
growth is not

855
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:29,430
compromised because of the production of

856
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:31,409
all of these genes and we know at the

857
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:34,409
transcriptional level all of these genes

858
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:37,349
gene products are made all of this 35 I

859
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:40,349
also show you another contract where we

860
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:42,719
have now started whittling down the 35

861
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:45,719
and we have now down to 24 and we have

862
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:48,329
it down now to even 10 I'm not going to

863
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:51,179
show you those data but basically what

864
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:54,360
what we the stage that we you are we are

865
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:58,710
right now is that silicosis is 63 6803

866
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:00,960
can fix nitrogen so basically what it

867
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,389
shows here is that here the three genes

868
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:08,490
that make the three structural proteins

869
00:36:03,389 --> 00:36:10,379
of nitrogenous with HD k in plans only

870
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:12,659
one of these the iron protein has been

871
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,869
expressed in chloroplast with great

872
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:18,599
difficulty because of again this bad

873
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:20,130
thing called oxygen so at every level of

874
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:22,110
the production of the functional

875
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:24,900
nitrogenous there is oxygen control in

876
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:26,960
negative manner and what we see here is

877
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,869
that in this organism where we put in

878
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,110
all of this we can have transcription of

879
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:36,650
nif hdk the black one actually shows the

880
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:39,760
whole setup 35 jeans and I show you this

881
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,869
truncated version 24 which has subset

882
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,610
appreciably higher level of

883
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:45,920
transcription level for all of these so

884
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,690
there are some negative regulators here

885
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,360
and I will not go into the details of

886
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:53,420
that but important thing is this this is

887
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:56,690
the first time to our knowledge that in

888
00:36:53,420 --> 00:37:00,050
a in an oxygen ich photosynthetic

889
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:04,039
organism one can establish the nitrogen

890
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:06,740
fixation machinery and so you could see

891
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:09,170
that there is production that that's

892
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:11,809
taking place nitrogen fixation let me

893
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:14,210
also point out because I usually this

894
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:16,179
question comes up this organism is still

895
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:19,460
not die as or trophic

896
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:23,690
because the control circuits are not

897
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:25,369
appropriate in fact this bug the cynic

898
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:29,480
assistance that has this nitrogenous

899
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:31,940
genes it produces the nitrogenous at the

900
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,849
wrong time namely at the beginning of

901
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:36,950
the day because that's the normal

902
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:38,920
program inside the cells we have had

903
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:42,649
recent

904
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:47,480
success in providing some control

905
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:49,610
elements in this cell to make it go the

906
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,699
way cyano TC goes but we are still quite

907
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:57,140
some distance from achieving the stage

908
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:59,029
where a robust nitrogen fixation cycle

909
00:37:57,139 --> 00:38:02,829
the diurnal rhythm is expressed in sino

910
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:04,850
TC this project is

911
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:06,380
the first part of the project that I

912
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,900
talked about on scientist systems

913
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,450
biology is a collaboration with Lucien

914
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:14,470
minute for the University and a whole

915
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:18,319
bunch of people led by dick Smith's at

916
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:21,529
pnnl Pacific Northwest National Lab and

917
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:25,039
then for the nitrogen fixation project

918
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:26,360
in science and in synechocystis these

919
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:28,949
are the four groups and all the people

920
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,870
who are working on there here is my

921
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:32,699
research group and airy creatures may

922
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:35,489
still remember rebstock halt it's a

923
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:39,059
right in front of the that at our lab

924
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:41,099
and I thank you and I thank you my close

925
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:44,029
collaborators designer bacterial cells

926
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:44,029
I'll take questions

927
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:54,380
it was a beautiful setting and I like to

928
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:56,869
ask and I might ask

929
00:38:54,380 --> 00:39:01,490
in the beginning you show us the

930
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:01,489
diameters of the different

931
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:05,449
and the civic assistance was smaller

932
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:08,570
than

933
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:12,159
the ones that do all the great stuff

934
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:15,430
does that body difference have any

935
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:17,440
ramifications and getting the diurnal

936
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:20,230
nitrogen fixation

937
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,940
no simple answer is we don't know that

938
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:25,639
are

939
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,740
yet look very hard or sets that are not

940
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:29,059
small

941
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:32,579
there are sign of pieces that have been

942
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:37,110
found insulated by John's air scoop

943
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:39,630
who's that had much smaller size

944
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:41,550
but those are the special services that

945
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:44,349
have fun too

946
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:46,840
and carbon fixation

947
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:48,360
they are

948
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,590
cells

949
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:56,079
that live together within elders edge

950
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:58,119
and then the story is more the algae

951
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:02,108
this is arvin

952
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,108
and that special like science

953
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:09,220
in that case cells are massive

954
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:11,019
so that your knee correlation we have no

955
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:13,409
idea but we have to encounter case that

956
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:13,409
question

957
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:18,889
yeah so there are a lot of really

958
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:21,000
interesting examples of regulation of

959
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:23,099
things happening in the dark or light

960
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,860
that started before the you know the

961
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:28,319
next phase actually occurred is there a

962
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:31,349
readout of the nutrient state in the

963
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,390
cell and somehow you know nitrogenase is

964
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:35,250
starting to shut off what glycogen is

965
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:37,859
running out have you measured the

966
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:41,929
glycogen at different point said nice

967
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:43,730
and yes yeah yes so grandpa Jim runs out

968
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:46,109
and

969
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:49,579
but it's not strictly correlated with

970
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,579
just the level of drivers

971
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,079
basically it all comes down to the

972
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:58,889
central control element X form is acting

973
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:00,659
as PT protein in bacteria that senses

974
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:04,019
the relative levels of carbon nitrogen

975
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:06,989
all of that story in works fine here but

976
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:08,730
what is not known is how the central

977
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:10,739
oscillator of scienter bacterial cells

978
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:13,289
which is very well-defined to the work

979
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:17,399
of suitable inner colleagues or coyotes

980
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:19,519
are you see how is that controlling this

981
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,619
entire program and

982
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,769
we don't have an answer to that but you

983
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:28,069
know some of those specialized

984
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:31,110
regulatory elements are involved in

985
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:33,650
figuring out the entire program this in

986
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,650
the complex

987
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:41,519
a lot of oscillating systems have

988
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:43,759
negative feedback loops and I'm just

989
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:46,259
wondering if you could elaborate on

990
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,840
evidence for or against such a thing

991
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:51,440
going on so in other words the synthesis

992
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,440
of an enzyme

993
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:58,490
reaches a certain concentration that

994
00:41:54,719 --> 00:42:01,489
then begins to shut down the synthesis

995
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:03,929
at that level again we don't have any

996
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:04,939
understanding at this level but

997
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:08,399
dismissed

998
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:11,030
at the level of transcription there is a

999
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,230
lot of evidence so they are odd

1000
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,820
negative feedback that are set up as

1001
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:17,369
well as positive feedback those

1002
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:21,600
regulatory elements have been identified

1003
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:24,630
by us and others and so one of the

1004
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:30,440
places I can I where we know quite a bit

1005
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:32,030
is this business of how the level of

1006
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:36,950
that transcript and not talking about

1007
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:38,960
proteins of nitrogenous go down during

1008
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:42,799
the dark shades

1009
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:46,400
it has to do with elements presently

1010
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,130
that you know that gave rise to small

1011
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,720
practice consolidation that going that

1012
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,550
get expressed exactly at that

1013
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:55,889
and we haven't proven it completely but

1014
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:58,260
the idea is that that then gets turned

1015
00:42:55,889 --> 00:43:00,809
on the whole business of in this kind of

1016
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,780
rhythm is whole question of anticipation

1017
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:06,150
of it one and

1018
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:10,440
we see evidence of that in every step of

1019
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:13,289
the way the cell knows when I come on

1020
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,750
by synthesizing more than the transcript

1021
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:17,750
protein

1022
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:19,550
of all the photosystems the cells know

1023
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:22,579
that oxygen will be coming out at that

1024
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:24,900
time so my Japanese is it goes down and

1025
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:27,029
data they also

1026
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:31,369
I believe that there were many such

1027
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:33,080
confidence we do not have much idea but

1028
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:35,799
as far as the enzyme levels and a

1029
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:35,799
feedback on that

1030
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:41,489
just one follow-up have you

1031
00:43:39,438 --> 00:43:44,338
kind of duplicated some of these

1032
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:47,880
experiments where you've extended the

1033
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:49,978
nighttime or the daylight period yes I

1034
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,989
guess we were talking about some of

1035
00:43:49,978 --> 00:43:56,278
those we have got all the displays

1036
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:58,619
expewience 18 6 + + 20 24 I can tell me

1037
00:43:56,278 --> 00:44:00,900
people 20 power supply than four hours

1038
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:03,059
of doctors this one doesn't work and it

1039
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,660
definitely doesn't work by four hours of

1040
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:09,298
identity or darkness there is a range in

1041
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:11,308
which it works basically I can summarize

1042
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:13,288
that those studies by saying the problem

1043
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:16,619
as long as you have sufficient amount of

1044
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:18,410
glycogen back to the store then nitrogen

1045
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:22,259
fixation does take place

1046
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:24,298
but in doing so we also figured out that

1047
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:26,748
we can separate out the two central

1048
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:29,309
processes destination and

1049
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:33,509
nitrogen fixation during the dark period

1050
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:35,610
quite a bit or unfrozen depending on the

1051
00:44:33,509 --> 00:44:38,639
length of library

1052
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:41,180
so those are classic time series

1053
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,179
experiment

1054
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:49,070
it has ecological implications debts of

1055
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:52,088
investment may be related to that

1056
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:55,330
partners which time it takes

1057
00:44:52,088 --> 00:44:58,690
transcript exactly

1058
00:44:55,329 --> 00:45:02,369
energy if you have synthesize and remove

1059
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:04,510
your machinery which is costly

1060
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:06,639
energy costs so I

1061
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:09,930
you playin service might be right you

1062
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:09,929
play with the amount of life

1063
00:45:10,289 --> 00:45:15,999
factoring down in our energy and

1064
00:45:12,548 --> 00:45:18,338
accumulate you see similar well not in

1065
00:45:15,998 --> 00:45:20,739
great detail but we have measured ATP

1066
00:45:18,338 --> 00:45:23,920
and nadph tables in these cells and

1067
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:25,679
those change predicted as we expect

1068
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,740
based on the energy

1069
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:32,578
but as far as you know what is the cause

1070
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:32,578
and effect

1071
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:39,369
you should that there's an ortholog of

1072
00:45:36,329 --> 00:45:43,009
the central d1

1073
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:44,519
vanya in other side of bacteria is that

1074
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:48,800
also family

1075
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:48,800
for class and if so what we came back

1076
00:45:49,219 --> 00:45:55,848
yeah well it's hard to tell what the

1077
00:45:52,909 --> 00:45:59,149
exactly of is if so and their bags at

1078
00:45:55,849 --> 00:46:02,059
that question but we coordinate that

1079
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:04,740
with saina bacteria that can fix manager

1080
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:06,489
as opposed to realize that

1081
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:08,589
w

1082
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:11,469
so how much conservation of these

1083
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:14,920
variant Camino assets is there a

1084
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:17,349
customer that has the central people

1085
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:19,500
yeah it said functional arrived

1086
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:22,420
somewhere actually

1087
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,969
let's say we take it is it yes very

1088
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:27,250
gassy to site-specific mutagenesis

1089
00:46:24,969 --> 00:46:29,289
experiments done in bad we know that as

1090
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:32,849
far everything is changed in uncharted

1091
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:36,070
kissimmee or even when it's changed to

1092
00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:39,519
glutamate that compromises madman is

1093
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:42,789
like being interested in functional what

1094
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:45,000
we find is that that those changes are

1095
00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:48,909
different in the different

1096
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,800
sd1 sense more like nature took the

1097
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:53,230
canonical T is the way that makes the

1098
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,030
normal game body and then made to

1099
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:58,360
specific changes things so that we no

1100
00:46:55,030 --> 00:47:01,590
longer can live in matrix but they are

1101
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,590
not the same changes

1102
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:11,940
infestation the better for the bacteria

1103
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:16,470
or the bacteria tuition from the late

1104
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:20,900
for the infection of 15 to be predation

1105
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:20,899
the hurricane don't occur

1106
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:28,450
again my answer needs to be annoyed

1107
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:28,449
it doesn't have to be

1108
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:31,309
proteins and mean and they just stare

1109
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:34,500
out and

1110
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:36,509
what's the need for making them so you

1111
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,860
know one way that I have used many times

1112
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:42,990
is that the first hour of blackness

1113
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:45,990
beginning of light for my charges like

1114
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:48,439
every day that's what happens in Maine

1115
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:48,439
and then

1116
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:54,949
assembles functionality but they can be

1117
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:57,300
played and they will be grid that time

1118
00:47:54,949 --> 00:47:59,909
station why that is necessary and

1119
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:03,240
whether that is absolutely necessary in

1120
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:04,889
the circus that we're putting sisters we

1121
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:07,659
don't have an answer but the triangle

1122
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:11,489
ends so I really don't have an idea of

1123
00:48:07,659 --> 00:48:11,489
why at fiji islands

1124
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,800
probably not

1125
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:19,170
about 80 tagging systems of torque

1126
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,269
sufficient education like Archie

1127
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,579
transformation

1128
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:27,380
discovered

1129
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:27,380
I being phosphorylation dusty

1130
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:39,159
when you are official anymore yet so the

1131
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,160
blubins plane

1132
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:49,930
no visual analysis than women yeah so

1133
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:51,639
that glow means that bind like you know

1134
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:54,568
probably that by yourself on my rope

1135
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:58,268
that binds oxygen inka

1136
00:48:54,568 --> 00:49:00,429
being system that i described they are

1137
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:03,188
used to actually sequester than oxygen

1138
00:49:00,429 --> 00:49:06,129
so that local conservation officer in

1139
00:49:03,188 --> 00:49:08,228
quotes down in Mississippi is only one

1140
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:10,509
globin gene and that has nothing to do

1141
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:14,848
with this is similar for science so

1142
00:49:10,509 --> 00:49:14,849
that's not that it is so it is a bad

1143
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:20,590
and that actually didn't suppose that

1144
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:22,299
cannot account for the local haunts me

1145
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,820
karate kid when you're in line

1146
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:28,300
photosystem 2 is working is super high

1147
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:31,050
principal that maybe I discovered and

1148
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,050
they speak

1149
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:43,769
is there a specific machinery and

1150
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:43,769
resistance for harvesting hydrogen that

1151
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:55,969
okay so you're talking about

1152
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:58,099
already fixed nitrogen like nitrate or

1153
00:49:55,969 --> 00:50:00,980
ammonia how does it do that is the

1154
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:03,980
sender thing bass tab which is

1155
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,980
transported

1156
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:13,119
in fact something that

1157
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:16,210
here was pointed out that the audience

1158
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:21,099
that fix nitrogen they actually sense

1159
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:24,480
that very very well so if we put in even

1160
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:28,030
micro molar concentration of nitrate

1161
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:31,030
into the scion tc cells not thinking

1162
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,980
session definity goes down over a matter

1163
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:35,970
of

1164
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:39,929
bombs so if hdk synthesis stops and

1165
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:43,108
again the curtains so we don't know why

1166
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:47,219
that happens but when there is enough

1167
00:50:43,108 --> 00:50:52,319
fix nitrogen the organisms do not do

1168
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:52,319
this is well known from other occasions

1169
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:09,829
this has been a production of Cornell
