1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,679
University very generous presentation

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,599
very kind words thank you very much and

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,480
I'm so glad to return to to it again to

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,480
the pl Pathology

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,960
Department uh I had great time here I

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,160
met my husband in the department of Na

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,400
pathology my my son was born here so I

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,800
have very good memories of my time in it

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,960
so they probably probably know my

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,280
husband will join me here in ITA by the

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:42,079
end of of June so I'm I'm really glad to

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,359
come here and and see so so many friends

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,239
uh around so I'm going to talk today

15
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:49,359
only about fight doter so sorry for the

16
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:51,640
bacteriologist and I also work with

17
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:55,359
viruses at some point of my career but

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,878
I'm I'm only going to talk about fight

19
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:02,120
today and only in the in the case of S

20
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:04,920
NA and and phyo species I have worked

21
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:07,759
also in other crops with the the

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,200
interaction with phyo in avocado and

23
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:14,118
other crops but I'm going to focus today

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,159
in this interaction so in my PhD I work

25
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:18,599
with bacterial disease a casava

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,799
bacterial disease in South America and

27
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:25,239
Africa and developing some resistance to

28
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:28,400
the CBB caused by S monos saxop but

29
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:31,719
manies and then when I came as a PO to

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,439
builds lab and then to PR Smart's lab uh

31
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:38,000
in Geneva I work with uh phy inesis and

32
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:41,000
we were studying the interactions

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,399
between the host and the pag and we were

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,599
interested in the compatible interaction

35
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,640
a lot of labs were dealing with the

36
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,319
resistance trying to understand the

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,319
resistance to to phyo but we decided to

38
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,718
focus on the compatible interaction

39
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:58,519
where the disease is is H so the we

40
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:01,839
started uh doing some some studies with

41
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:04,478
with potato and we found a role for the

42
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,359
carbonite and hydrates and it was my

43
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:10,639
first collaboration with bti with a

44
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:14,360
great Mar and and people in his in his

45
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,839
land and we found a role for this enzyme

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,560
the Carbonic and hydrates that when we

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,840
silence this enzyme in Plants we saw

48
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,120
that the pathogen that phyo infests grew

49
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,239
more quickly indicating the suppression

50
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,920
of the Carbonic and hydrates can

51
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,319
increase the susceptibility to be infest

52
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:34,559
and that was interesting but more

53
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,280
interesting to me was that the largest

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,920
group of te suppressed during the

55
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,519
compatible interaction were

56
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:46,279
photosynthesis related and we we we

57
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,959
wanted to understand how or why we we we

58
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,199
can imagine that the plant shuts down

59
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,878
the photosynthesis so the plant can um

60
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,719
dedicate all the efforts to uh for the

61
00:02:53,878 --> 00:03:00,039
to the resistance or to resist the the

62
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:02,120
attack when I went to Colombia we

63
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:05,120
approach this question with a more

64
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,480
broader uh focus and we use this

65
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,560
metabolic reconstruction as an novel

66
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:13,119
approach for this characterization of

67
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,598
these interactions and we did um a a

68
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,120
reconstruction of the metabolism of the

69
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:22,439
plant uh when during the compatible

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,519
interaction and this is very very I

71
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,158
think it's amazing to see how the

72
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,280
metabolism of the plant changes during

73
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:33,318
the time course of the disease uh which

74
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,239
spot you see here is a metabolite so you

75
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:39,839
can see how the the the metabolism

76
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,878
changes drastically and then it recovers

77
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,280
then it changes again then it recovers

78
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:47,039
and then finally the plant will die but

79
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,400
the plant is trying to adjust the

80
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:53,158
metabolism to resist to this dat we

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,599
found a connection with the with the

82
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,078
photosynthesis through these pathway so

83
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,560
the good thing with this metabolic

84
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,239
reconstruction is that you can explore

85
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,959
each pathway if it's suppressed or

86
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,759
activated during the interaction and we

87
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,598
found that the probably one of the key

88
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:14,039
uh to this uh photosynthesis oppression

89
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,358
was lying in the glutamate synthesis

90
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,238
reduction we know that glutamate is

91
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:22,000
involved in the chlorophyll synthesis

92
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:25,560
and other steps but we found a very good

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,360
key there unfortunately I couldn't

94
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,319
continue this uh this this study because

95
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,879
we didn't have fun

96
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,839
for for this St but while I was here

97
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:40,639
also in Cornell we did something that

98
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:43,719
was probably very I don't risky we did a

99
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,079
transcriptomics analysis in the field I

100
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,560
think that people probably thought that

101
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,519
at the moment that we were crazy to do a

102
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,639
transcriptomics analysis with plants in

103
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,159
the field they said you're are going to

104
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,918
have so many so much background of the

105
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,840
expression you will not see the

106
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:03,799
differences in the response of the plant

107
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:07,198
and you can see that our field in in

108
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,400
free had more Flags than plants because

109
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,478
we had to identify each of the plants

110
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,478
with the treatments and we repeated this

111
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:21,639
experiment five times over the season

112
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:24,399
and we could find some expression um

113
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,240
even with a big background we saw a lot

114
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,120
of expression coming only to put the

115
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,120
plants in the field but over that

116
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,478
background we could see that some genes

117
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,319
and I'm not showing only two of them

118
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,680
that

119
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,919
showed an expression in the resistant

120
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,800
cultiv over the susceptible one we

121
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:45,680
silence those genes and we saw that

122
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,960
silencing those genes the they reduce

123
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,199
the resistance in the

124
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,680
resistant so from my studies here in at

125
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,199
Cornell and with this uh study of these

126
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,759
interactions I can have two take home

127
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,879
messages the first one is like we have

128
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,360
to try to integrate functional genomic

129
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:07,120
information and biochemical knowledge so

130
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,800
we can see and understand the properties

131
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,360
that arise from the interaction between

132
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,520
the metabolic systems components and it

133
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,280
responds to the environment and the

134
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,198
behavior over time so I don't know if

135
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,519
the metabolic reconstructions are the

136
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,879
answers they are models and models have

137
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:26,839
their Ops and downs and they are good

138
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,918
things and bad things but at least we

139
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,918
can see a broader picture of the

140
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,918
interaction with these metabolic

141
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,879
reconstructions for that study we

142
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:39,120
collaborate with with people that have

143
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:41,199
this metabolic reconstructions uh very

144
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,639
well adapted to their systems in in

145
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,879
bacteria it was the first time we were

146
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:50,000
trying to do it in a more complex genome

147
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:53,839
like the one in Pho Paris and the second

148
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,639
one and and be continue this studies in

149
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:59,839
in this is that you have to study your P

150
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,120
PL pathogen interaction as close to real

151
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,519
crop conditions as possible we know that

152
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,800
the highly controlled environments like

153
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,878
the ones in the greenhouse grow Chambers

154
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,199
May render the plant highly responsive

155
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:15,720
to non-treatment subt environmental cues

156
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:20,160
that will hide the true responses to the

157
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:23,240
to the p and we showed with our field uh

158
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,599
in free that field experiments that the

159
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,840
the field ground plants and and use

160
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,399
field ground

161
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:33,478
plants uh does not prude the detection

162
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:37,120
of important difference so try to to do

163
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,918
the experiments are close as as to to

164
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,240
real conditions

165
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:47,079
are and then in 2004 I moved to Colombia

166
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,319
and in Colombia I was my main focus of

167
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:54,598
research was Pho senul I call it sensul

168
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,960
because when I arrive I try to to I I

169
00:07:54,598 --> 00:08:00,719
think I was working only one one species

170
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:03,799
that was Pho infestus and then we end up

171
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,800
with two species and when you work in

172
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,598
Colombia and Rebecca knows this very

173
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,918
well it's there are complex environments

174
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,839
we have potatoes all year long and we

175
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:18,038
have when you have the potato fi you can

176
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,638
have in the in the garden of the grower

177
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:23,800
all the other host of the pathogen so

178
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,800
nice because you have the reservoir of

179
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,639
the inoculum going all year long so you

180
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,560
have uh cake boost berries you can have

181
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,759
solanum keto you can have Peppers you

182
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,038
can have solanum basium so you have all

183
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,559
the host of the of the pathogen to the

184
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:43,720
potato fls so not surprisingly when you

185
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:46,759
start your your crop the pho shows up

186
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,278
immediately so my the the I tried to

187
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,559
study the pathogen in Colombia and the

188
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:55,519
last study of phyo infest when I arrived

189
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:58,679
in 2004 the last study dated like 15

190
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,000
years old so we had to to see what was

191
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:04,159
going so we studied the host we did a

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,879
continuous monitoring of the populations

193
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,159
I'm going to I'm going to show you some

194
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:13,000
studies in the population studies

195
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:14,480
genomics of the new uh species we studi

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,320
the pathogenicity and violence

197
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,600
determinants and I'm going to end up my

198
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,399
my seminar showing you some alternative

199
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,278
ways to control

200
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,879
pesis so first we wanted to establish

201
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,720
the all the hosts in Columbia we have

202
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:35,240
this huge diversity of scious crops in

203
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:39,320
Colombia so we wanted to to to

204
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:42,440
show or to to see which were the plans

205
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:46,440
to host fight of and we could show them

206
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,680
in in this Sol scops of course in potato

207
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:53,120
we have the yellow potato that is Solan

208
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:56,239
fura some breeders call them Solan

209
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,679
Tu Subs species fora that is the yellow

210
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,839
small potato the Tomato three Tom and

211
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,838
I'm going talk a lot about the

212
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,679
Tomato that here you have you can hear

213
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:14,919
other names like golden goldenberry I

214
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:18,519
think or cap I call it capeberry

215
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:21,919
P peruana and one wild species of

216
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,919
solanum that is

217
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:28,278
solanum and we started our population

218
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:31,120
stud but first uh let me give you a

219
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:36,078
quick guide to standard population of of

220
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:39,200
f so usually this is a clonal u pathogen

221
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:42,039
usually well it's um p inessence is

222
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,000
heteropathic so it it has to have the

223
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:47,120
two mating types to go to sexual

224
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,600
reproduction but usually in South

225
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,600
America you only find one of of them in

226
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,720
some countries you find only the A1

227
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,320
making Ty in other countries you find

228
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,800
the A2 but you don't find it's very rare

229
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,519
to uh to find the two of them in a in a

230
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:09,159
in a country so we study this pathogen

231
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,399
as clonal lineages and all members that

232
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:14,240
a CL Le is all members descend from a

233
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:18,200
single individual so we can have us one

234
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,399
us2 us3 Etc depends on the time us one

235
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,759
who are the first described in the US

236
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:27,120
and so on in Ecuador Colombia

237
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:30,319
Etc and a clonal lineage is defined by

238
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:34,240
uh several markers the an genotype the

239
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,920
RF rflp fingerprint mitochondrial type

240
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,600
that can be 1 a 2 A 1 C and the mating

241
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,439
time so once you have an isolate you

242
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,720
have to run all the test to see to which

243
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,480
clonal lineages it belongs so in my

244
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,560
first study when I arrived we publish it

245
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:56,440
four years later uh to my arrival we

246
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:59,119
characterize the population in col so

247
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,120
apparently everything was easy one the

248
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,959
the one found in Ecuador so it

249
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,480
corresponded to the clonal lineage ec1

250
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:10,159
that replac the US US One population

251
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,000
previously described 15 years before and

252
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,559
all the strains were A1 and we found

253
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,360
among more than and in all my life I

254
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:19,838
think I collected more than 1,000 pH

255
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,839
ofter strs and we only found one that

256
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,560
was the A2 mating typ and it was

257
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,079
Associated to falis Peruvian and I

258
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:31,239
described the disease I swear I saw it I

259
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:34,799
published it and after that I couldn't

260
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,879
infect falis again we even came to

261
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:41,159
Cornell to put it in the field with with

262
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:43,879
a strong pathogen pressure never got

263
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,919
infected again so that is a mystery that

264
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:50,439
still HS me at night that fight do out

265
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:53,838
the falis and I couldn't see any other

266
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,959
A2 train in Colombia anyway so there was

267
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,720
with the the traditional markers uh the

268
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,799
easy one and then we use G genes to

269
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,560
describe the population to see how many

270
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,719
Hypes per Gene we had in the population

271
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:11,000
we use mitochondrial gen we use nuclear

272
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,879
gen we use an avence Gene and we saw

273
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,679
that it was pretty like very clonal only

274
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,879
one applo most of the time and in

275
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:23,679
Venezuela it was it was sunite because

276
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:25,679
it was like white and and black like you

277
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,638
had one appy in Venezuela and the other

278
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:32,958
one in Colombia was it was really nice

279
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,120
and um and we had some diversity uh but

280
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,359
most of them were very very good and we

281
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,799
saw this in the south of col an

282
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,120
explosion of diversity of Hypes in the

283
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,278
south of colum and I'm going to come

284
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,759
back to that story uh

285
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:51,799
later and then we use what everybody was

286
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:56,838
using at the moment in and then in in in

287
00:13:51,799 --> 00:14:00,799
2019 the micro satellites and again from

288
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:03,120
one only one clonal lineage E1 we saw

289
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:06,719
this explosion of diversity each color

290
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,519
represents a genotype with the

291
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,680
microsatellites and you can see in

292
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,839
different locations of only one state of

293
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:18,599
colia the huge diversity that you have

294
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:23,079
so what we have one rflp fingerprint

295
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:26,560
with 76 mlgs so it's we have to

296
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:28,919
understand why we have this this

297
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,278
diversity and if corresponds to

298
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:33,719
different levels of Vance uh we still

299
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,759
have to to understand but it was nice

300
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,320
because we could see or we could answer

301
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:43,879
the question if the AO types were uh

302
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,680
correlated with the the region or the

303
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:50,198
the the location or with the genotype of

304
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,719
potato and we couldn't see any

305
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:55,599
association or any relation you can see

306
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,440
the app types that are in color that

307
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,159
they are sorry the the app types that

308
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:05,639
are the the circles uh they they have

309
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:08,439
different Origins and they they you can

310
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,879
see them in different regions the same

311
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,240
with the genotypes the genotype we could

312
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:17,480
isolate different uh genotypes of

313
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:21,519
different genotypes of the pathogen from

314
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:24,720
one genotype of the potato of the host

315
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,399
so it was there was not a correlation

316
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:32,000
between geography neither geography nor

317
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,759
the potato gym but the good thing after

318
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,720
all this work is that with Carlos new a

319
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,959
plant breeder potato breeder we could

320
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:44,079
release last year three new varieties

321
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:46,078
resistant to to phyo implant so all

322
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:49,159
these years all these monitoring all

323
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:52,078
these trying to identify the the

324
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:55,078
different individuals and variants help

325
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:57,000
us to identify the resistance in these

326
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:00,479
varieties of of

327
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,839
BU and we also monitor the resistance or

328
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,480
susceptibility to different fungicides

329
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:11,519
in colia so the most common fungicide is

330
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:15,079
meano and we saw a very um High rate of

331
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:19,399
resistance to this methan oxan in in

332
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:22,318
colum very susceptibility to to other

333
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,559
compounds but this was very amazing

334
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:27,120
because in Colombia they spray by

335
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:30,318
calendar they spray once or twice per

336
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,759
week in it regardless of the conditions

337
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:35,719
regardless of everything and they don't

338
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,159
know that we or at least at that moment

339
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,519
in 2019 we didn't know that we had this

340
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:44,519
high level of resistance to these

341
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,480
meths we also studied the populations of

342
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:50,120
of tomato the populations of phyo

343
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,360
infests associated to tomato and we

344
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,480
found and you see the the ones in tomato

345
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,199
with is dark blue that are really

346
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,399
separated from the ones from potato that

347
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,919
is in the light blue and even you see in

348
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,439
this network that they could they could

349
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,119
even be in a way to ESP speciation

350
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,319
probably a new species we don't know we

351
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,879
didn't explore that but they are really

352
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:16,678
not connected some of them to the rest

353
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:20,160
of the population of of f we studied um

354
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:23,360
a question that was uh proposed very

355
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,400
long time ago that the the strains

356
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:29,798
isolated from tomato and potato have

357
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:33,640
host preferences and uh we indeed showed

358
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:36,000
that the strains isolated from potato

359
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,799
when they are inoculated in in potato

360
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,839
they cause more disease higher level of

361
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,918
disease and when the isolates are

362
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:45,359
isolated from tomato and they are

363
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:49,360
inoculated in tomato you see very strong

364
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:52,798
H preference to Tomato than to

365
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:55,639
potato and when we so what is the what

366
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:58,038
was the the resistance of susceptibility

367
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,280
of these tomato strings compared to the

368
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:03,519
US strengths to three different

369
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:07,519
molecules myoan simoan and

370
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:11,279
flu we saw that we had again uh high

371
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:13,519
levels of resistance in in our um

372
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:17,240
strains to methan

373
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:19,558
oxan and uh compare also to the US strs

374
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,038
in Colombia we have high levels of

375
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:26,359
resistance to me

376
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:30,079
me and doing those experiments and this

377
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:32,879
was the work of julana is here present

378
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:36,678
in the fry lab they discover in the in

379
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,880
the or they describe also in the fry lab

380
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:41,480
a phenomenon that also was described a

381
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,480
long time ago that is the methano

382
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,400
acquired

383
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,720
resistance when you grow your isolates

384
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,080
in different concentration of the

385
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,480
fungicide you see that you can kill them

386
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:58,279
but they don't grow but you when you

387
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:01,679
take a inoc from a super Lal uh con

388
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:04,480
conentration of me meam and you PL it in

389
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,720
a higher concentration you see this very

390
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,038
rapid acire resistance to the

391
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,600
funes and it occurred in it was

392
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,440
Juliana's paper during her undergraduate

393
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:18,519
studies it occur in different phyto

394
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,440
species and genotypes and seems to be

395
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:23,158
unique to this methano it didn't show in

396
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,558
other with other

397
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:31,400
molecules so she see she uh did a a more

398
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:34,359
in- depth study reanalyzing whole

399
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,519
transcriptomic profiles of strains that

400
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,879
were submitted to this methen oxan in

401
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:41,798
silico search for alternative po one

402
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:46,600
subun RNA po one subunits in the Genome

403
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:49,960
of Pi probably um fight ofare was using

404
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:53,240
other subunits to resist to this uh

405
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,640
fungicide she also did some qrt PCR

406
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,240
profiles and she analyzed also the small

407
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,880
non-coding rnas to see if there was some

408
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,279
epigenetic phenomenon point and she came

409
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,880
up with this nice model that first she

410
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:11,678
saw that there is a pleotropic drug

411
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,400
resistance that um triggers a primary

412
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,720
cellular response that maintains the

413
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,320
pleotropic drug resistance but but they

414
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:23,839
were also evidence of some epigenetic

415
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:26,439
mechanisms of this C so I invite you to

416
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:30,158
read her paper it's nicely written and

417
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,159
it's very nice model of

418
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,919
and then let me go back to the story of

419
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:38,918
these fyo populations in the south of

420
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,240
Columbia so you remember that we have

421
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,799
this explosion of diversity so we wanted

422
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,880
to explore what was going on with this

423
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:49,279
population at the time there were these

424
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,440
species described in South America and

425
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,720
Central America we have in Mexico Fight

426
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,279
of th m fight of and in South America we

427
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:03,120
had this new described species that was

428
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:05,158
called p and so probably we were dealing

429
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,558
with two species in the south of columia

430
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:10,840
fight of th infest and effect ofina and

431
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:13,440
we want to know a little bit more so we

432
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:18,278
went back to literature and saw that in

433
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,038
2000 Mario oron a of M in Ecuador had

434
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:24,440
published this uh paper that she was

435
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:28,679
reporting no population ofo she didn't

436
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:31,278
say infests it was sensul similar to p

437
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:34,840
attacking wild solanum species in a

438
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:37,759
attacking these species it was A2 The

439
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:41,519
Mating Ty for the first time in Ecuador

440
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:43,720
with a new mitochondrial H 1 C and they

441
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:47,798
were NE neither pathogenic on potatoes

442
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:51,759
nor tomatoes and then in

443
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:55,639
2004 this uh this paper showed that they

444
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:57,640
discover additional to the A1 1A

445
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,919
mitochondrial Hypes they discover

446
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,480
another another

447
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:07,278
lineage that was an ec2

448
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:10,839
lineage with A2 and 1 so at the moment

449
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:14,759
we had two clonal lines of pandina ec2

450
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:16,519
EC3 well they didn't call yet pandina

451
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:21,278
they said they were novel populations

452
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:25,480
ec2 EC3 US1 with different mitochondrial

453
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:28,839
hpes and different making types okay and

454
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:32,440
then uh this this uh the paper was

455
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:36,399
published on the phogy of phyo and they

456
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:39,120
call it phyo and thetive new species and

457
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,759
but they say and this is very important

458
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,918
that ambigous Gene sequences pattern of

459
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,798
nuclear DNA in Panda could indicate a

460
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,720
hybrid origin and that is

461
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:54,720
interesting because it was something was

462
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,319
going on on the nuclear DNA DNA of these

463
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,120
group of species and then my friend

464
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:03,000
Ricardo published this paper describing

465
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:06,239
the species fight of tanina and they

466
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,278
said we have this set of strains one ec2

467
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,599
associated with wild species and the EC3

468
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:14,798
associated with solanum betas the three

469
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:18,119
tomain

470
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:20,319
and personally I didn't like this paper

471
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,599
I talk to Ricardo several times and we

472
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:25,278
sent a letter to the editor saying that

473
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:28,879
there were not evidence to define a new

474
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:31,319
species and why not because first they

475
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,919
couldn't like we saw probably a

476
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:41,519
different two two different species of p

477
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:43,600
and uh one to the EC3 and ec2 so we we

478
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:47,558
knew that there were something in in

479
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:49,839
this uh diversity that was not a hybrid

480
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:51,079
species we were probably talking about

481
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,639
two different

482
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:56,960
species when we did the we took the the

483
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,200
data from the genomes of the the

484
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,840
mitochondrial genome and we saw that

485
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:06,240
they were really different these two one

486
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:08,038
c and 1 a because in P infest within the

487
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,038
same same species you can have different

488
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:14,519
mitochondrial Hots but these were really

489
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:17,319
and these were also clustering with

490
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:20,558
different species so apparently they

491
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:22,759
were very Divergent and when we run some

492
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:26,158
genes we couldn't differentiate P Anda

493
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:28,960
of being infested so in this letter to

494
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,799
the editor what we were saying is that

495
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,720
we didn't think there were enough

496
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:38,440
evidence to say that P andina was single

497
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,200
SES and in Colombia a group in the south

498
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:44,240
of Colombia showed that with AFP they

499
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,840
can they could uh show this separation

500
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,159
of the ones associated with Sol solanum

501
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:54,839
basum and the one with potato so we were

502
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:58,000
dealing with several so we took several

503
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:59,798
uh we tried to get several lines of of

504
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,240
evidence to show that we were dealing

505
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:06,798
with a different uh with different

506
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:09,960
species um actually with with three

507
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:13,440
different species the first thing we did

508
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,640
is to grow these three species what we

509
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,038
believe that were the three species so

510
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,120
at the moment we call Pi Anda the ones

511
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:25,919
associated with the wild species of the

512
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:28,479
of solanum p infests and p beta the one

513
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,759
associated with the e three group

514
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,599
Associated to solanum betum so this is

515
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:36,919
the EC3 group and this is the ec2 group

516
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:41,678
and you see that when you use three

517
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:43,480
tomato Ager the pum grows pitasi sorry

518
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,240
grows very well compared to the other

519
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,679
ones but it doesn't grow at all in

520
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,200
potato so that was our first line of

521
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,679
evidence we also did a lot of

522
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,640
morphological descriptions and you see

523
00:25:54,679 --> 00:26:01,600
that usually well being F uh look like

524
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,080
this with a papilla and in the spanga of

525
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:06,158
P beta say that is all of these you

526
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,398
couldn't see well you see all sport but

527
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:12,640
you couldn't see sometimes the papilla

528
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:15,439
so you see some intermediate espira

529
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,799
without papilla so we also saw some

530
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,519
difference in the morphological

531
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:22,960
descriptions then we did uh some

532
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:25,720
philogenetic studies and we could see

533
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,519
that p andina and p beta say were

534
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,720
separated and so these are in red the

535
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:37,278
strains we collected and in in green we

536
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:41,440
have the p uh the P andena from solanum

537
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:44,960
basum that was described in the Ricardo

538
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:49,080
Pap and we saw that they were separated

539
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,278
with different uh tools we also measured

540
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:54,000
the content of DNA in the three species

541
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:56,798
and we see that in P we have the double

542
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,440
content of DNA than in the other species

543
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:01,440
so you can see here the the summary of

544
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,558
the content in the in the genome so we

545
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,120
have more DNA in the nuclei of pet aade

546
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:09,398
and in the other

547
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:13,038
species uh and then in population

548
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:17,199
studies again when you you take the the

549
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:18,919
cap and the that shows the the best feet

550
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,960
you can see the tree population

551
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:24,600
separating and and here with this phc

552
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,278
the APC studies you see really that they

553
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:30,519
will separate the three species separate

554
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:33,759
with the panda associated with DC3

555
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:36,879
clustering with the ones isolated from

556
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:39,158
tree tomato in col and of course we did

557
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,000
all the infection assets we inoculated

558
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:45,559
everybody in every genotype so the three

559
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,960
species in we didn't have the the white

560
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:49,839
solanum plants in Colombia so we

561
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,360
couldn't inoculate but we inoculated in

562
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:56,439
tomato potato and three tomato and we

563
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:59,359
showed again that P beta say only can

564
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:03,440
infect Sol but cannot infect the other

565
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:07,439
host and also that P infant doesn't go

566
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,320
very well in the in in three domain and

567
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,960
the final line of evidence like as a

568
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:16,439
biologist is to show that there is

569
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,880
reproductive isolation so we did all the

570
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,440
crosses this is hard work Bill knows

571
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,760
that to do all these crosses and see if

572
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,600
we had the the formation of O force of

573
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:31,440
hybrid ability we have premating

574
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:35,119
isolation or

575
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,360
postotic isolation and we I'm going to

576
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,918
show you only the results of the P

577
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:42,959
infest P beta say showing that the

578
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,919
hybrid are absent some all spores are

579
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,079
formed but they are not viable so the

580
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,080
hybrids are absent and we have the

581
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:53,519
reproductive isolation so with all these

582
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:56,720
lines of evidence we could publish that

583
00:28:53,519 --> 00:29:01,440
we have a new species within the clay 1

584
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:05,278
C Associated to sanum basum in Colon so

585
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,320
pandina in in reality is two different

586
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:10,519
like was two different species P andina

587
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:13,519
corresponding to the ec2 with different

588
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:17,919
mitochondrial genomes and P beta say the

589
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:19,720
one EC3 associated with uh solanum basum

590
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,960
and we were in face of an eological

591
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,079
speciations the three species are

592
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,600
reciprocally monoptic that is the final

593
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:29,639
proof to have a new species and the most

594
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:34,558
probable scenario speciation with a

595
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:37,519
secondary cont and and then and and we

596
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:40,119
after that we we saw that it is now

597
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,599
clear that we needed a UNIF unified

598
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:46,278
conceptual framework to to properly

599
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:48,000
Define the species in Plant Pathology

600
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:51,679
and characterize the Divergence

601
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,839
processes in in these plant pathogens so

602
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,919
we try to to show this in in this paper

603
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:01,000
in in the annual review of that phop

604
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,440
pathology that studying the processes

605
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,319
involved in ESP speciation it boils down

606
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,759
to understanding the barriers to the

607
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:10,759
genetic exchange we have to show the

608
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:15,599
reproductive isolation most of the time

609
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:18,919
it's preing because the there is um one

610
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:21,959
of them cannot infect the or or both of

611
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,759
them cannot infect each other's host so

612
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,840
we have this prating isolating because

613
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:30,839
they are really isolated by The Host but

614
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:34,319
sometimes you can have a postotic

615
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:38,079
isolation when you don't have the viable

616
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:41,639
all sports of viable hybrids

617
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:43,918
showing so uh we need to connect

618
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,679
molecular taxonomy with reproductive

619
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,600
isolation to properly Define a species

620
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,640
sometimes we only show phenetic species

621
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:55,759
without showing if there's a barrier to

622
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,720
this uh exchange and the patter and H

623
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,480
range appears appears to be constrained

624
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:04,278
by the pathogen effect of reper but

625
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:08,319
there we haven't studied the relation

626
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:11,038
between the plant immunity gen genes and

627
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:14,720
um shaping the evolution of new plant

628
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:17,119
pathogen species and most of the times

629
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,639
there are the study of ecological and

630
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:22,000
geographical drivers will lead to better

631
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:23,439
understand of these events that caus the

632
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,278
reproductive

633
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,960
isolation after that we came back to the

634
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:32,240
field to see if this new species was

635
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,558
only in the south of Colombia or was in

636
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:40,919
other parts and we saw that is also Co

637
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:43,398
um is is in sympatry with phyto infants

638
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,399
in the central part of colum and again

639
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:48,479
with a most with more strains we again

640
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:52,079
could demonstrate that we have the three

641
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,599
different populations P Fest associated

642
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:59,678
with the different solanum we have the

643
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:01,918
the pessant the three the Tomato strains

644
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,440
that we have probably to study them a

645
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,120
little bit more because they they

646
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:11,320
separate from from others petas and Pi

647
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:13,759
so we have the the different

648
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:15,759
species and probably you remember that

649
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,480
we have twice the content of DNA in the

650
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,839
nuclei and we so we went and sequenced

651
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,919
the Genome of these new species and show

652
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:25,759
that most of the genome was a whole

653
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:29,480
genome duplication the the Genome of the

654
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:31,319
infest is huge but it's mostly due to

655
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,079
the repetitions and to all the

656
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:35,439
transposons you have you find in the

657
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:38,079
genome but in P beta say you find the

658
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,679
whole genome duplication a lot of the

659
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:45,319
conts of the phy infests are duplicated

660
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:48,480
in the Genome of the P beta say of P

661
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:51,079
betas and we studied the all the the

662
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,798
effectors we have different kind of

663
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:57,879
effectors the apoplastic effectors the

664
00:32:53,798 --> 00:33:02,879
prle ones and the RX RL and we found

665
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:05,799
that some of them are um in both pieces

666
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,039
but some of them are unique to be beta

667
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:11,359
say so now we have to show if these

668
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:15,359
unique ones are the ones that allow beta

669
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:17,519
say to to to thrive in solanum betas so

670
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:21,240
we have in the three categories some of

671
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,638
them that are unique to bet some are

672
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,558
shared and some are also unique to P

673
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:30,278
infests but most of them and we found an

674
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:32,839
explosion of fectos in this genome

675
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:36,278
B so in the final minutes I'm going to

676
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:38,918
talk about uh also with we try to I

677
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:41,720
collaborate with some biochemists to to

678
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:43,919
find novel solutions to control the the

679
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,600
the the dcas or control

680
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:51,840
phyo so we focus in this pathway the

681
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:55,798
denovo pering biosynthesis in in phy

682
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:59,359
there are two ways that phy gets the the

683
00:33:55,798 --> 00:34:01,599
the P with the the noal synthesis but

684
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:05,359
they also have the Salvage

685
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:07,558
P so our hypothesis that is that Pho

686
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,960
uses the the noval synthesis during the

687
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:12,679
biotrophic stages of the disease and

688
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:16,358
then when it goes necrotrophic it will

689
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:20,320
do go to the Salvage P we have to to

690
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:21,960
demonstrate and why focusing on this p

691
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,079
uh some of these enzymes have been

692
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,119
attractive for drug development in

693
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:32,800
humans and in plasmodium for example

694
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:36,720
this um compound has been used uh to uh

695
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,560
to inhibit the fourth enzyme of the

696
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:43,199
denovo synthesis pathway in some

697
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:45,799
treatments to autoimmune diseases in

698
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,559
humans but also other compounds have

699
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,839
been used to control the plasmodium

700
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:56,000
falum the malaria parasite and you know

701
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:59,920
that phyo is very close phenetically to

702
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,079
this malar pathogen to plas is is is

703
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,400
closer to this to funi everybody knows

704
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:10,760
that but is very close to the to the

705
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:15,559
malaria P so to answer the first

706
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:17,839
question we try to see the the the

707
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:20,358
expression of the enzymes during the

708
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:23,358
time course of the disease and we could

709
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:27,519
show that the the noo the the noo

710
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:30,920
enzymes are all um activated during the

711
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:34,838
biotrophic part of the disease and the

712
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:38,838
Salvage ones are uh down regulated and

713
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:40,799
then um the Salvage ones is is the

714
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:44,159
contrary during the sorry during the

715
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,400
Salvage pathway the denov synthesis

716
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:51,879
enzymes are down

717
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:54,559
regulated no I'm starting again so the

718
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,440
denov enzymes are activate the denov

719
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:00,880
enzymes are Activa during the biotrop

720
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:04,280
and then down regulated during the Sal

721
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:07,400
the contrary to the uh during the

722
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,920
necrotrophic part part of the disase

723
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,318
that the denovo are down regulated and

724
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,318
the Salvage are up

725
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,720
regulated so we took one of these

726
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,838
compounds I was talking about the one

727
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:25,719
that was used against the human enzyme

728
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:29,279
and we first showed that is U is

729
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:33,000
localized the enzyme is localized in the

730
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,240
mitochondria uh and then we try to

731
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,800
inhibit the growth of pest with this

732
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:40,719
campound and we compare with the crate

733
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,960
that is a fici side and you can see that

734
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:46,358
we could um

735
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:50,079
that increasing the dose of the compound

736
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:53,400
we could inhibit the growth of P fests

737
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:56,200
comparing uh very comparable to the to

738
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,920
the Fungicide and something very

739
00:36:56,199 --> 00:37:02,559
important is we want to show that the

740
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,318
the the the enzyme from the potato and

741
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,318
the enzyme from the pathogen had

742
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:08,719
different sensitivities to the to the

743
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:10,559
compound and indeed you see the the

744
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,199
scale we show that they have different

745
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:16,119
sensitivity is good because you will not

746
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:19,318
inhibit the enzyme of the pathogen you

747
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:22,480
will only inhibit the enzyme of the of

748
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:27,159
the pathogen you will not eat theam of

749
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:29,838
the host only the one in the back so

750
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,519
my final take home message in Colombia

751
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,719
agriculture is a very important sector

752
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:37,079
of the economy accounting for more than

753
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:40,439
16% of employment and

754
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:43,039
7.5% of the gross product with

755
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,358
significant challenges low productivity

756
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,358
no data driven low adoption rates of

757
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,480
Technology no impartial extension

758
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:53,199
services and only a very few of the

759
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:57,760
gross domestic product is invested in

760
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:59,639
research in colum so I highlighted the

761
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,079
importance of continuously monitoring

762
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,039
the pathogens population with the

763
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,960
funding we had you see that we could

764
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:10,358
only monitor the populations in 2000 in

765
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:12,358
2004 2012 2019 we couldn't do this

766
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:14,598
continuous monitoring of the pathogen

767
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:16,559
population and we have to do that with

768
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:18,800
the appropriate Market that allow

769
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:21,279
discriminating variants at the local and

770
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,440
global scale we did that also with the

771
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,920
Santo Monas and is really nice how you

772
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,920
can adjust the level of discrimination

773
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,960
adjusting the use of the markers that um

774
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,559
are uh available also the importance of

775
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,199
working with breeders to select the

776
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:40,759
pathogens variants we we have over my my

777
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:43,199
life I I work with breeders in casava

778
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,760
and potato and we also end up with

779
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:48,118
releasing new uh resistant varieties and

780
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,640
then and we need to understand the

781
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:51,960
relationship between the genetic

782
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:54,279
structure of the pathogens and the n and

783
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,639
then and the distribution of

784
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,359
pathogenicity and and vness

785
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,358
but during my life I also work with funi

786
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:04,639
so I want to show you some pictures of

787
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:07,440
my research with

788
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:10,159
cords with

789
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,000
amanitas and uh with

790
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:15,159
morels and I've we found this in the BRS

791
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,400
of the

792
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:20,318
university and really interesting and

793
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,800
this is really interesting because we

794
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:27,519
could grow some in V we have the

795
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,359
seet and then we also studied the

796
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:32,880
microbi

797
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:36,119
microbiological diversity in endites and

798
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,318
I have sampled BMS I have sample plants

799
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,720
in very extreme environments in the

800
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:44,000
paramas so and this is always thank you

801
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:46,318
to my collaborators around the world

802
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,318
thank you

803
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:58,200
very very nice um thank you is the B

804
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:01,400
Cho Auto or Al po

805
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:02,679
huh I don't know but we can collaborate

806
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:07,200
and

807
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:09,679
see yeah it seems to be alop when we did

808
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:14,719
we I also published a paper before I

809
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:17,199
knew there was a new a new uh species we

810
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,598
published this paper with Nick Grunwald

811
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:20,519
in Oregon State showing the high levels

812
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,400
of

813
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:25,358
heteros of the of the T so I think it's

814
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,240
an

815
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:29,119
Al

816
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:31,199
where thank you so much for that

817
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,400
wonderful story I I also take my hat off

818
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,519
to you for being able to continue

819
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,318
throughout managing

820
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,559
University so I was really I mean so

821
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:45,239
much of that is fascinating but the fact

822
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:48,078
that you're pessi uh treat your

823
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:51,639
your can grow on tree tomato Agra but

824
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,640
really cannot grow on potato dexos like

825
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:55,078
it seems sort of like either there's

826
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:56,039
something that it means is not there or

827
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,440
there's something that it doesn't like

828
00:40:56,039 --> 00:41:00,920
that is there so like what is is there

829
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,599
sort of a straightforward nutritional

830
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,599
problem that that contributes to the

831
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,680
host isolation I think it has to be with

832
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,838
nutrition not only with the effector

833
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:13,519
repertoire but also with

834
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:17,559
nutrition um we haven't been able to to

835
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:19,239
isolate petas from potatoes in the field

836
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:22,318
you put a little that potato into the

837
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:25,039
tree tomato AG does it Crush its ability

838
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:27,599
I'm going to try yeah probably something

839
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:31,000
in the potato

840
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,599
that found in the potato that yeah but

841
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,519
you cannot inoculate like it doesn't go

842
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,680
in in Lees

843
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:42,280
or yeah so has to be I think it's not

844
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:44,679
only the effector repertoire as I say

845
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,800
there has to be something else Fanci

846
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:48,799
your explanation that seems necessary

847
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,240
yeah so what's the range of tree tomato

848
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,239
and

849
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:01,118
is throughout the range

850
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,559
of well yes but I can say that in the

851
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:07,000
metric system I'm sorry I

852
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:09,519
will yeah three tomato can go to very

853
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,400
low well not low LS I would say from

854
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:16,440
1,000 to 2,000 meters above the sea

855
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:20,000
level and we could find all fight of thr

856
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:22,559
all over the the range yes because we I

857
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,760
when I did this sampling I started in in

858
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:29,599
the Magdalena River very like zero MERS

859
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:32,200
about the 11 went up to bota that is

860
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,400
2,600 and we could find isolates all

861
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:37,439
over the I was doing another project in

862
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,920
colto triome but I was sampling also phy

863
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:45,679
and we could see the phy beta all over

864
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:50,119
the about through South America North

865
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:52,639
South um we haven't done that but then a

866
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:55,400
a paper was published in Peru showing

867
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:58,920
different populations in using the phog

868
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,960
philogenetic three some branches all and

869
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,599
I think one of these branches they don't

870
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,400
call it P bet say but I think one of the

871
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:10,000
of the Clusters is p beta yeah so I

872
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,880
think we discussed that with my friends

873
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,119
in C we were going to do that but then

874
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,119
bti hired me so I

875
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,759
could yeah yeah go ahead I was trying to

876
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:31,039
see if there anything the the diversity

877
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,880
and infesting that you see in columia do

878
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:36,599
you attribute that to just the fact that

879
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:39,519
it can persist year round and all those

880
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,440
HS are there so it just multiplies a lot

881
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:44,880
or do you think there's some other

882
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,639
factor ining that diversity I think it's

883
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,200
a plant biodiversity that we have and

884
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:54,039
all these solanum species we haven't

885
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:58,078
well you know that most of Colombia is

886
00:43:54,039 --> 00:44:00,519
um uh it's is not explored because of

887
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,960
the problems insecurity we had in them

888
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:06,119
but once every time I go to the field I

889
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,000
I described a new species of funi of

890
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:10,920
Aman and I'm sure that in the plant side

891
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,639
there should be also explosion of

892
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:17,000
solanum species like when Mexico and and

893
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,078
Bill described this very well in Mexico

894
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,039
you also have a lot of solarm species

895
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:25,000
and they could describe different phyo

896
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:28,000
species as well so it goes with the

897
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
host

898
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:35,679
is

899
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:35,679
know sexual

900
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,720
compatibility you might see after

901
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:48,079
speciation GM acquisition

902
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:54,039
patient whatever that would reestablish

903
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:56,400
seual comp right you know for

904
00:44:54,039 --> 00:45:01,838
merging it could be really relevant

905
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,838
thinking about poal forver sets

906
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,720
of no but is something that is probably

907
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:16,800
very doable right now the the problem

908
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:19,959
with I don't think there is a good Pondo

909
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,960
genome right now that is we couldn't do

910
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,880
a lot of comparisons with panda because

911
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,280
the genome that is available is not in

912
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,440
good good shape put SE again um but I

913
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,280
think it's it's a good thing to see the

914
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,280
qualis and all the diverges of the

915
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:41,280
effect of reper yes we can do that stud

916
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,280
right now with with the genome

917
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,639
treatment other questions no I don't see

918
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,679
any on the

919
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:52,358
online Okay um then let's thank syvia

920
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:57,399
again and may I remind the students in

921
00:45:52,358 --> 00:46:00,039
posto has lunch with Sylvia in

922
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,039
somewhere

923
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:15,639
somewhere
