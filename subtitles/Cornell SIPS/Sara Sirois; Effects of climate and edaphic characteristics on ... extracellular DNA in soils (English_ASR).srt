1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,359
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:10,980
University I'm going to tell you a

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,989
little bit about the research I've been

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,000
doing looking at the stabilization and

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,149
degradation dynamics of extracellular

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,390
DNA and soils and specifically how those

7
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:24,538
dynamics are impacted by agricultural

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,219
management and habitat type so the first

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,640
question you might have is what is

10
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,710
extracellular DNA so extracellular or a

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,100
DNA is any DNA strand that's not

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,100
contained within itself and in soils as

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,770
in other natural environments um e DNA

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,579
arises when the DNA inside of a living

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,250
cell is either actively secreted or more

16
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,109
commonly a cell will die it will vice

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,519
and it's cellular contents will spill

18
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:55,140
out into the environment and in soils a

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,629
DNA is important for a variety of

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,128
reasons namely it's an important source

21
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:01,229
of nitrogen and phosphorus so it's

22
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:02,429
important for nutrient cycling it's an

23
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:06,030
important structural and functional

24
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:08,239
component of bacterial biofilms and it's

25
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,519
a key player in horizontal gene transfer

26
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,408
but for the purposes of this talk we're

27
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,349
really concerned about the potential

28
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,969
that a DNA presents to introduce bias to

29
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:21,539
our estimates of microbial community

30
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:23,548
structure so this question has really

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,770
risen to the forefront in recent years

32
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,380
due to the increasing accessibility of

33
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:30,179
high and for those of you who aren't

34
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,609
familiar with this method the basic

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,500
workflow is that you take a sample and

36
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,629
extract the total DNA from that sample

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,540
which will include both intracellular

38
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,069
and extracellular DNA you can amplify a

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,759
gene of interest and then directly

40
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:47,250
sequence those amplicons and under the

41
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,649
sequencing conditions that we use in the

42
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,629
Buckley lab we expect between tens and

43
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,420
hundreds of thousands of sequences per

44
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:57,989
sample so that's a lot of information

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,939
right and as we analyze that information

46
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:03,269
one of the key assumptions that we're

47
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:05,908
making is that every DNA sequence that

48
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:08,340
we see derives directly from a living

49
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,560
cell so the idea is the cell is present

50
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,360
in the soil it's alive and well you kill

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,069
it when you extract its DNA

52
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,380
and then you can draw direct comparisons

53
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,889
between your sequences and the living

54
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:22,379
cells in the soil but a DNA violates

55
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:24,629
that key assumption namely because the

56
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,329
cell from which a DNA came might have

57
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,729
been dead for a long time but that a DNA

58
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,719
remains stable and sequence a ball in

59
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:36,689
the soil and you can't tell those right

60
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:39,659
so the areas of a DNA research where

61
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,819
there's general consensus is that EDMA

62
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,829
can be stabilized on soil minerals

63
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,099
specifically clays and to some extent

64
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:50,219
stamp sands and also on soil organic

65
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:52,169
matter and that a DNA can persist over

66
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,699
long periods of time and that it can

67
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:56,309
make up a really large portion of the

68
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,709
soil DNA pool generally on the order of

69
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:03,390
like 20% to 80% so it's not

70
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:04,739
insubstantial where we lack consensus

71
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:07,199
however is when we start to ask

72
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,330
questions about the extent to which a

73
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,839
DNA is introducing bias to our estimates

74
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:15,270
of microbial community so there was a

75
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,430
paper that came out last year where they

76
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,189
took a reagent that targets specifically

77
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,799
extracellular DNA they treated soils

78
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:24,509
with that reagent to remove a DNA and

79
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,510
then compared the sequences from the

80
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:29,129
treated soils to the untreated soils and

81
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:31,649
what they found is that there was a

82
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,989
significant a DNA driven bias in terms

83
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,510
of bacterial richness diversity and

84
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:39,120
community structure so for microbial

85
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:42,060
ecologists this is big news and it's bad

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,379
news because if that's always true it

87
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,750
means that the work that we've been

88
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:50,549
doing for years has this unaccounted for

89
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:52,949
source of bias bad but there was another

90
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,780
paper that came out last year also where

91
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,518
they used a similar technique but a

92
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,500
different reagent so comparing treated

93
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,750
and untreated soils and they found that

94
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,430
regardless of the size of the e DN a

95
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,430
pool so even when it was like 80 percent

96
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:08,819
there was still no significant EDMA

97
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,829
driven bias so what's a researcher to

98
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,719
think right we have these two really

99
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,500
well-respected labs telling us

100
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,120
completely contradictory information and

101
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,459
so as a way to wade into this

102
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,399
conversation I wanted to test the

103
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,280
hypothesis that the degradation dynamics

104
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,310
of Eady

105
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:30,479
which will influence a DNA driven bias

106
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:33,280
um vary across gradients of both

107
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,640
agricultural management and also habitat

108
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,229
type and so to start with I needed soils

109
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,259
from a management gradient and so I

110
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,330
chose to use samples from a long-term

111
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:44,829
corn trial that's been running in Chazy

112
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:48,099
New York which is like way up in the

113
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:49,620
north country and this is a multi-decade

114
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,210
study where they've been applying

115
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,660
factorial combinations of intensive

116
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:57,819
tillage no-till corn biomass removal and

117
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,070
corn biomass return so this has resulted

118
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,569
in a really clear management gradient

119
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:05,019
that's accompanied by a really clear

120
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:06,819
soil organic matter gradient and then

121
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:09,189
for my habitat gradient I chose to

122
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:11,740
sample more locally this is monkey run

123
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:13,329
and right here in Ithaca New York and I

124
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,930
collected samples from agriculture

125
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:19,149
meadow and forest soils at that site and

126
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,639
so as I was testing this hypothesis

127
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:24,099
I was also bearing in mind to sort of

128
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,289
follow up questions the first of those

129
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,660
is what is controlling the degradation

130
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,819
and stabilization dynamics of edn and

131
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,430
soils and the second of those was over

132
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:37,599
what time scale do we expect any EDMA

133
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,400
driven bias to be apparent so to try and

134
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,169
answer these questions I performed a

135
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,839
series of laboratory microcosm

136
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:46,689
experiments where put some soil into a

137
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:51,939
microcosm and then I added a synthetic

138
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:54,129
DNA marker so this is real DNA made of

139
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:56,560
nucleotides but it was synthesized in a

140
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:59,560
way that I designed so this marker

141
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,970
contains two different sets of Kaymer

142
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,160
sites that allow me to do two different

143
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,800
types of analysis so the first of those

144
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:10,780
shown here in green here and here well

145
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,030
white at least is a high-throughput

146
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:17,250
sequencing appropriate primer site so

147
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:19,478
it's it uses or it will be targeted by

148
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,120
Universal bacterial sequencing primers

149
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:24,939
the other primer site that I built into

150
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,889
the synthetic a DNA um where primer

151
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:28,569
sites they're specific only to this gene

152
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:31,449
right this is it these are primers that

153
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:34,589
we don't expect to amplify anything else

154
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:37,019
in our soils so

155
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:38,729
my soil in my e DNA I allow my

156
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,709
microcosms to incubate and I

157
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,509
periodically collect sub samples of

158
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:45,029
those and then from each of those sub

159
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:47,339
samples I collect total DNA or extract

160
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:51,719
total DNA and again this total DNA

161
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:53,849
Wilkin will contain both any DNA that

162
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,950
was natively present in the soil but it

163
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:59,939
will also contain however much of my

164
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:02,819
synthetic DNA gene is still present so I

165
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:03,959
have my total DNA and then taking

166
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,759
advantage of those two different primer

167
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,329
sites I use two different types of

168
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,339
analysis on the same deal the first of

169
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:13,709
those was an EDM a marker specific

170
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:16,199
quantitative PCR so this is a technique

171
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:18,269
that will measure only the synthetic DNA

172
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,759
genes not telling me anything about the

173
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:22,409
rest of the community the second

174
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,670
technique that I use is high throughput

175
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,400
sequencing the technique I was

176
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,620
describing earlier and this technique is

177
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,500
going to tell me not only about how much

178
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,149
of the synthetic DNA is present but also

179
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,800
about what that looks like in the

180
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:38,339
context of the larger bacterial

181
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,620
community from the soils let me show you

182
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:43,109
some reason so starting off with these

183
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,620
are the qpcr data from the management

184
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:49,949
gradient and we have here on the the

185
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,899
y-axis the amount of a DNA that remains

186
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:54,839
in the sample and then as we move across

187
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,789
the x-axis we're moving through time the

188
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,449
first thing we note is that between time

189
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,980
zero and day seven so that's a one-week

190
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,199
interval and I want to point out that

191
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,879
this is a log scale on the y-axis so

192
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,860
what we're seeing in that first week is

193
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,409
a two to three order of magnitude

194
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,150
decline in the amount of a DNA marker

195
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,520
that's still present followed by

196
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:18,060
relative stability across the rest of

197
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:20,189
the experiment so to better understand

198
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,990
these data I fit them using a nonlinear

199
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:25,350
least squares modeling approach with a

200
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,750
Weibull type mortality curve so this

201
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,910
type of curve has three parameters it

202
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,340
has a starting value parameter so that's

203
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:36,300
sort of up here it has a decay rate

204
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:39,690
parameter and then an asymptote range

205
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,639
and the nature of the model allows us to

206
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,800
compare those parameters between

207
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:47,220
treatments and I want to stop here and

208
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,059
say that the starting quantity parameter

209
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,860
is the same

210
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:52,199
across all of our data and all of our

211
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,430
datasets which is by design so we feel

212
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,450
good that that was su result we got

213
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:56,729
right we wanted to start with the same

214
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,009
amount so we're we're really looking for

215
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,420
differences is in the decay rate term

216
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:03,960
and in the asymptotes or the

217
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:06,750
stabilization term and what we see for

218
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,028
our management data is that first off we

219
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,490
were not able to detect many differences

220
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:14,970
in the decay rate terms between

221
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,549
treatments and I want to sort of drive

222
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,680
home at this point that that two to

223
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:22,979
three order of magnitude decline in E

224
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,909
DNA in the first week um means that you

225
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,440
know we didn't there was a lot of

226
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:27,600
degradation that was happening that we

227
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,130
didn't capture sufficiently so it's

228
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,649
really coarse resolution and what that

229
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:33,659
means is that there might be differences

230
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,889
in decay rate that we just aren't able

231
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:39,629
to see because of the course of our time

232
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:41,789
but what we are able to see is a

233
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:43,528
difference in stabilization between

234
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,299
treatments so we found that

235
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:48,809
stabilization was significantly

236
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:50,879
different and greater under no-till

237
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:53,279
management than it was in our tilled

238
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:58,580
samples so no-till management is

239
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,579
resulting in greater EDMA stabilization

240
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:04,800
so the next bit of data I want to show

241
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,950
you is the high-throughput sequencing

242
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:10,139
data from the same management gradient

243
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,570
right so these are the same tubes of DNA

244
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,980
analyzed in a different way and you

245
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,720
probably noticed that this looks a

246
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,879
little bit different um we're still

247
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,950
looking at the amount of a DNA that's

248
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:22,860
present on the y-axis and we're moving

249
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:25,410
through time on the x-axis we're still

250
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,779
seeing a two to three order of magnitude

251
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:29,549
decline in that first seven days so

252
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,230
that's all consistent but what's really

253
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:34,588
different about the sequencing data

254
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,659
versus the qPCR data is that with with

255
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:39,560
the qpcr we were able to detect the e

256
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:41,219
DNA marker in every sample at every time

257
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:45,359
whereas with the high throughput

258
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:48,028
sequencing at time well seven days here

259
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,490
we start to lose the ability to see that

260
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:52,110
DNA in some of our samples so all these

261
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,680
samples that are sitting right down here

262
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,629
on the the x-axis those are samples

263
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,059
where we were not able to detect a DNA

264
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:01,439
and the samples where we were able to

265
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,809
detect the e DNA

266
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,880
appear are inching really close to this

267
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:07,589
horizontal line which represents our

268
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,330
estimated limit of detection for

269
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,460
high-throughput sequencing so

270
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,710
essentially high street food sequencing

271
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,019
is a less sensitive method and so even

272
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:19,379
early on we start to lose the ability to

273
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:21,480
detect a t DNA and as a result of this

274
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,950
lack of sensitivity we weren't able to

275
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,200
detect any differences between

276
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,509
treatments at any time which is in sharp

277
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,340
contrast to the qpcr data where we were

278
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:31,830
able to detect differences between atill

279
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,450
than the no-till students so I want to

280
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,060
sort of pause and really drive home that

281
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,770
point about differences in sensitivity

282
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:39,479
namely that qPCR is a much more

283
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:41,429
sensitive method of detection than

284
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,379
high-throughput sequencing and that that

285
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:46,379
difference in sensitivity is going to

286
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,720
impact our ability to see DNA driven

287
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:52,470
bias so method sensitivity is going to

288
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,269
matter so I'm going to bring us back

289
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,090
into the data now and to show you the

290
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:58,799
habitat gradient data plotted and

291
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:02,519
modeled in the same way as the

292
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,500
management data so again we're seeing a

293
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,679
two to three order of magnitude decline

294
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,590
in the first week followed by relative

295
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,689
stability we're still using that same

296
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:15,690
model modeling we're looking for

297
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,240
differences in this case we were able to

298
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,100
detect a difference between decay rates

299
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,649
namely in that the decay rate of the

300
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,830
forest soils was significantly different

301
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:28,199
from and slower than the decay rate of

302
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,420
the meadow soils right so forest has

303
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,540
slower degradation than meadow soils

304
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,139
initially but by the end of the

305
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:36,179
experiment

306
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:38,189
it's the meadow soil but has

307
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:40,739
significantly more or significantly

308
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,270
different and more stabilization than

309
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,330
either the agriculture or the forest

310
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:47,009
soil so there's this decoupling right

311
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,680
between initial degradation and

312
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:53,610
stabilization and long-term degradation

313
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:55,469
and stabilization all right and then

314
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,019
when we look at the sequencing data for

315
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,310
those same tubes we're seeing very

316
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,079
similar things to what we saw with the

317
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:03,029
management data right we're still able

318
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,070
to detect the e DNA standard at time

319
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,569
zero and all of our samples we're still

320
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,580
seeing a two to three order of magnitude

321
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,950
decline in that football and we're

322
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,990
starting to lose the ability to detect

323
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,000
the e DNA in those samples with our

324
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,889
sequencing method

325
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,379
and again we couldn't detect any

326
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:24,720
differences between treatments with our

327
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:25,919
sequencing data so pause there bring it

328
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,490
back to this hypothesis that I was

329
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,399
testing

330
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,259
I was testing whether or not a DNA

331
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,840
degradation dynamics would vary across

332
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,689
gradients of habitat and management and

333
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:40,110
I thought that was not what I want to do

334
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:43,050
um so I demonstrated that those do both

335
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,840
impact me DNA degradation dynamics right

336
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:48,539
so both tillage being part of management

337
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,910
and habitat influence stabilization in

338
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:52,949
the long term all right

339
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:55,740
so the follow-up question that I was

340
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,480
asking was what's controlling a DNA

341
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,539
degradation and stabilisation dynamics

342
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,490
and so to try and get at this question

343
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:05,549
because remember I in the management

344
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:07,440
training I saw this there was a really

345
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:09,000
strong soil organic matter gradient that

346
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,130
went along with that management gradient

347
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,240
and so soil organic matter seems like a

348
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:14,220
really good place to start

349
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,690
right when looking for the underlying

350
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,850
controls so I plotted or I look for a

351
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,100
correlation between soil organic matter

352
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:26,250
that I'm using percent carbon as a proxy

353
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,110
for with the amount of a DNA that was

354
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,299
still present at one so this is after

355
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:34,019
that initial precipitous decline and

356
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:36,209
what we see is that there is a strong

357
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:39,600
positive correlation between soil carbon

358
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:42,470
and initial a DNA stabilization and that

359
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,730
this correlation is strongly significant

360
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,170
so that's cool right that tells us that

361
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,310
soil organic matter is playing a role

362
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:53,069
here but interestingly when we look not

363
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:55,229
at initial stabilization but rather at

364
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,150
longer term stabilization so by the end

365
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,060
of the experiment that correlation

366
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:01,799
completely disappears so this again

367
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,259
drives home that point that there is a

368
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,909
decoupling between initial degradation

369
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:10,439
and stabilization and long term

370
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:13,110
segregation and stabilization so the

371
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,210
second follow-up questions asking was

372
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,919
over what insight what the first

373
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,720
question was what's controlling those

374
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,240
degradation dynamics and what that

375
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,910
decoupling is telling us is that we're

376
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,330
pretty agreed that DNA is entering the

377
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:30,208
soil as a DNA something happens and

378
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:32,310
some portion of that a DNA that enters

379
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:34,349
the soil might ultimately be stabilized

380
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:36,479
but we have a lot of questions about how

381
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:42,659
much of the e DNA gets stabilized over

382
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:45,930
timescales by what what methods and so

383
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:47,929
our results suggest that when e DNA

384
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:50,909
enters the soil one of the controls

385
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:53,250
between entrance and stabilization is

386
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:56,100
soil carbon right so it's having an

387
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:59,039
impact on what kind of proceeds on this

388
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,350
pathway towards stabilization but our

389
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,819
results also tell us that soil carbon

390
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,850
isn't the only thing controlling us

391
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,980
right there are some other processes or

392
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,290
set of processes that are controlling

393
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:17,820
whether or not the e DNA that enters the

394
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:20,490
system is ultimately stabilized is over

395
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,399
what timescales do we expect cDNA driven

396
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:25,950
bias to be a parent so this figure is

397
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,620
for illustrative purposes only but what

398
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,839
we're showing is that if we take the

399
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,789
qpcr data where we were able to detect

400
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,790
the e DNA and all samples at all times

401
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:38,129
and we overlay that sensitive method

402
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:39,539
data with the limit of detection of our

403
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:42,179
less sensitive high-throughput

404
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:43,528
sequencing which is a more common

405
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:47,009
technique and in many ways more

406
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:50,189
informative what we're looking for is

407
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:53,159
the time that it takes after a DNA

408
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,320
addition for the amount of a DNA to drop

409
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,269
below that high throughput sequencing

410
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,250
limit of detection which you can sort of

411
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:00,629
think of as a veil line right the DNA

412
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,879
might still be present but once it's

413
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:04,500
below that limit of detection you can't

414
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,588
see it anymore so it's not impacting

415
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,299
your results and this figure shows us

416
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:11,970
that with a treatment that has really

417
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,799
slow degradation the time that it takes

418
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,390
between the when the e DNA enters the

419
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,480
system and when it drops below that veil

420
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:20,100
is going to be longer than in a really

421
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,439
fast degradation treatment where that

422
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,088
that time will be shorter and this is

423
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,470
gonna have implications for like

424
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:27,869
practical implications for sampling

425
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,690
right if you are doing time course

426
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:34,709
sampling and you are concerned about

427
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:36,120
will my results be biased by E DNA these

428
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,150
are gonna be important numbers for you

429
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,919
to think about so let me show you um

430
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,210
the numbers that I got and I

431
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,950
want to point out at this point that I

432
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:49,769
did this sort of analysis for the

433
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:52,019
habitat data as well as for the

434
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:54,599
management data down here but that I

435
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:55,980
also looked at the impacts of moisture

436
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,309
and temperature which were not data that

437
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,539
I presented today um but across all of

438
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:03,059
these different treatments we're seeing

439
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:04,649
a pretty wide range of you can think of

440
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:07,169
it as sort of the delay between when the

441
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,090
EDA is added and when it disappears the

442
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,710
shortest time that we saw was a day and

443
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:14,579
a half and that was in a very high

444
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:16,559
moisture soil so that DNA was pretty

445
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:20,039
much gone immediately as compared to a

446
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,220
really low temperature treatment four

447
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:24,269
degrees where we're seeing that that EDA

448
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,549
sticks around above the limit of

449
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,930
detection for nearly two weeks right so

450
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:30,480
that's a big difference this is telling

451
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:33,180
us that differential a DNA degradation

452
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,930
has an impact on how much bias we're

453
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,310
seeing our results so the directions

454
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,200
that I think this project should take in

455
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:44,159
the future are first off to really

456
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,680
explore that relationship between short

457
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,840
and long term DNA degradation right we

458
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,750
saw this decoupling between initial and

459
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,939
long-term and as part of that it's going

460
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:56,720
to be important for us to understand why

461
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,519
we could see that tillage and habitat

462
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,470
impacted long term stabilization but

463
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,450
that soil organic carbon which seemed

464
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,980
like a really likely culprit wasn't

465
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,650
really driving all the way through the

466
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,259
so what other processes are involved

467
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,120
here aggregation is a neurology is it

468
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:14,879
some other process or set of processes

469
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:17,399
and then in addition to answering those

470
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,190
questions it's going to be important for

471
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,880
us to gain better resolution in that

472
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,350
first week after a DNA addition so turns

473
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,910
out that sampling after one week is a

474
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:29,129
little too coarse right we've missed a

475
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,930
lot of information so we want to address

476
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:36,330
that right go back and look at what that

477
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:38,730
data tells us and then finally the

478
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:40,199
experiments that I did are useful right

479
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,210
we learned from them we feel good about

480
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,140
that but it's also really important to

481
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,900
note that they have their limitations

482
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,300
and one of the main limitations of this

483
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,400
type of experiment is that I'm adding a

484
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:53,519
whole bunch of a DNA at once and then

485
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,360
I'm watching that same DNA marker too

486
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,059
great right

487
00:19:54,359 --> 00:20:00,629
but in natural systems we see constant

488
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:03,359
turnover of of DNA of microbial biomass

489
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,650
and so that one-time addition isn't

490
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,829
really representative of what's

491
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,509
happening in reality so how do repeated

492
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:11,069
DNA additions which are more

493
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:13,470
representative what happens in reality

494
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:18,659
how do they impact degradation and

495
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:20,039
stabilization of E DNA all right so tie

496
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,190
this all together right we had this

497
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:25,649
controversy how did we add to that and

498
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,000
so the thing is that I can say you know

499
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:30,150
we might not be able to say whether or

500
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,950
not we have like maybe all is lost maybe

501
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,100
all isn't lost but what we can say

502
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:37,289
conclusively is that it's highly likely

503
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:40,109
that gradients of management and habitat

504
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:43,440
and moisture and temperature will result

505
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:45,979
in differential EDMA driven bias in our

506
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,180
results right so these gradients matter

507
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,130
additionally we're gonna need to use

508
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,350
caution when we sample with really fine

509
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,180
time point resolution because of that

510
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:55,619
sort of delay between when Edie and I

511
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,840
enters the system and when it drops

512
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:00,059
below our detection threshold and then

513
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,819
finally the sensitivity of our detection

514
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:04,769
method is going to matter so if not this

515
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:06,359
really cut and drive like we're all

516
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:09,299
doomed or no we're all fine right

517
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,859
there's some subtlety there and so I'd

518
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,200
like to end by acknowledging my

519
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:15,839
committee Dan and Joe who has both been

520
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,970
instrumental in helping me organize and

521
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,589
execute these experiments I'd like to

522
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:22,110
thank the whole Buckley lab for your

523
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:23,549
humor and your patience and a specific

524
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:26,519
shout out to Rowley and Sam for their

525
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:27,690
help with sequence analysis I'd like to

526
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,210
thank Dennis at the statistical

527
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,309
consulting unit and I'd like to thank

528
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,700
and if anyone has any questions I will

529
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:40,450
gladly take those

530
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,450
[Applause]

531
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:53,690
what's the steady-state concentration of

532
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:56,209
DNA in soil xor the e DNA I know that

533
00:21:53,690 --> 00:22:01,909
what you would find in nature nearest

534
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:09,009
places about parking generally we see

535
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:12,890
between 20 picograms of several grams

536
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:16,370
per gram is sort of maximum

537
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:19,009
I had a question about the sample

538
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:21,678
preparation can you get rid of a DNA by

539
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:30,859
just using different preparation can you

540
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:33,679
sort of subtract cells from segregate

541
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:35,419
DNA from intracellular DNA the two

542
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,240
studies that I talked about earlier the

543
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:41,630
first one used a DNA intercalating dye

544
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,609
called DNA that didn't you know remove

545
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,820
the e DNA from the system that's it

546
00:22:43,609 --> 00:23:01,159
hi and then the second study that I

547
00:22:46,819 --> 00:23:04,519
discussed just used a difference right

548
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,500
and so I did you look like obvious

549
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:10,819
people they looked into the methods like

550
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:12,919
anything sort of to distract you what

551
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:15,048
could be different between these two you

552
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:17,450
know mentos it's just a matter of the

553
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:22,250
cell it's an extraction it's you know

554
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:25,880
how they sound where they sample tact is

555
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:29,179
not much I'm gonna be really which is to

556
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,040
say that my immediate reaction when I

557
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:33,500
read both of those papers was to start

558
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,418
pointing out flaws in their methods and

559
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,980
I could do that but it seems more

560
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:39,320
productive to rather than try and like

561
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,960
tear down what people had done you can

562
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:43,428
sort of add the conversation but some of

563
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,410
the methods that they use specifically

564
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:47,480
the DNA intercalating guy could be

565
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,250
really powerful but there's also you're

566
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,048
sort of like many many steps away from

567
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:56,808
nature that way so there are always

568
00:23:54,048 --> 00:23:59,240
flaws in the methods and i think that

569
00:23:56,808 --> 00:24:01,579
you know as research into this a DNA

570
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,919
driven bias increases right like the

571
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:05,480
more people who read these papers were

572
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:07,309
happily you know everything's messed up

573
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,769
i think people are gonna really nail

574
00:24:07,308 --> 00:24:11,769
down the best way to address

575
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:23,549
