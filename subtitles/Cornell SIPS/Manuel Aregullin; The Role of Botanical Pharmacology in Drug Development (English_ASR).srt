1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,120
University so what I'm going to do today

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,638
is uh talk almost exclusively uh about

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:19,000
undergraduate research uh they have

5
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:20,679
contributed heavily on advancing the

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
chemistry and pharmacology and natural

7
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:26,839
products in in my lab so I'm going to

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,359
present a montage of the most relevant

9
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:33,039
projects that have they have undertaken

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:39,558
so I'm going to start a little bit with

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:43,840
uh uh G lipidomics and uh uh referring

12
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:45,799
uh in uh particular to uh lipids such as

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,039
phospholipids fingol lipids neutr lipids

14
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:50,280
and qu noites and then I'm going to

15
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,600
spend the rest of the time talking about

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,600
disease targeted Botanical pharmacology

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,960
with emphasis on particular diseases

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,879
since that is what really drives uh

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,879
plant research in in my lab so let me

20
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:11,400
start with a little bit about uh cell

21
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:14,798
chemical biology um and that's by way of

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,840
of a very early project that an

23
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:22,159
undergrad uh undertook in my lab uh his

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,799
name was uh or is Matthew Ginsburg he's

25
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:29,960
an MD degree now and uh so uh so at the

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,560
time that we initiated uh this Pro

27
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:36,599
project and was financed by a hatch

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,000
Grant the egg industry in the state of

29
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,239
New York was under heavy Financial

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,078
stress and that is because regulation

31
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:49,919
was changing and now small and medium

32
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:52,959
large uh egg producers needed to

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,920
accommodate uh chicken uh housing

34
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,839
requirements such as larger spaces etc

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,439
etc that was putting a lot of stress on

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,520
them uh

37
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:07,718
and so there was a call for uh Grand

38
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:08,519
proposals on Research as to how expand

39
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:12,919
the

40
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:16,120
market uh of eggs and possibly the

41
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:20,238
development of added value

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,719
products so this CAU my interest because

43
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,840
thinking as a chemist I look at the egg

44
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:29,919
as an a chemical Factory actually so it

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,239
when looks at the structure of an egg is

46
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,399
heavily

47
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:37,759
compartmentalized um the oneir of the

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,080
weight of an egg is the egg yolk and the

49
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:44,719
egg yolk is actually uh choke full of

50
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,680
lipids okay uh and probably you know a

51
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,719
little bit about the stories around

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,239
cholesterol in eggs ET ETA which

53
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,239
actually have been debunked already

54
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:59,239
there's no threat of cholesterol

55
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:03,280
intoxication from eggs so um so the egg

56
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:06,360
yolk actually is greatly composed of

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,799
what we call overall as Lestin which is

58
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,120
a mixture of phospholipids and you're

59
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,480
all familiar with the structure of

60
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,799
phospholipids a glycerol back uh

61
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,318
backbone phosphor related with a uh head

62
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,840
group that can be choline ethanolamine

63
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:25,798
Serene of or inositol and

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:30,438
acetated um by various types of fatty

65
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:32,799
acids so uh egg Lestin actually has an

66
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:35,680
application in medicine and that is the

67
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,080
pharmaceutical industry utilizes the

68
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,519
lesian to uh

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,400
formulate uh drugs that are going to be

70
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,039
actually administered parentally that is

71
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,080
they're going to be administered

72
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,719
intravenously for example all right so

73
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,640
there are drugs that actually cannot be

74
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:58,639
made uh water soluable and therefore

75
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:01,119
they need to be formulated uh in these

76
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:04,279
uh vesicles so EG Lestin has the

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,438
capacity to form is seals that can then

78
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,959
uh include uh different types of uh

79
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,680
theraputic

80
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,158
agents the only problem is that well

81
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,680
these my seals have had some kind of

82
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,358
compatibility uh with uh Maman cell

83
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,800
membrane

84
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:27,039
composition so so the idea then uh was

85
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,918
to look at the possibility of deriving

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,199
from eggs from the state of New York uh

87
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,719
that were appropriate in composition for

88
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:39,160
this application so I felt the need to

89
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:43,120
put some you know economic data into the

90
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:46,360
whole Venture uh as a justification and

91
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,720
just recently at the USDA uh has

92
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,720
established that the value of a grade A

93
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,080
large egg is 13

94
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,199
cents now if you look at signal

95
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:03,120
catalog uh they sell 250 milligrams of

96
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:05,759
reagent gred a Lestin for $59 right so

97
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,000
one grade a large egg contains two grams

98
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,639
of Lestin Worth

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
$472 right of course I'm not including

100
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,519
you know production costs obviously but

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,160
this is just to ex exaggerate and make

102
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:21,399
the point all right now in theory if you

103
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,800
calculate you know you can increase the

104
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:28,560
value of an egg by more than 3,000 times

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,400
in egg letin value right so in anyway so

106
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,478
but the question is as I say is this

107
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,758
leson actually suitable for use by the

108
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,478
pharmaceutical

109
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,560
industry well uh I regreted

110
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:44,519
participation of a uh New York State uh

111
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:50,478
egg producer um uh cre Farm uh fresh

112
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:53,038
eggs um uh uh Kurt Creer is actually uh

113
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,680
the main owner of the company is a

114
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,599
family-owned business actually but it's

115
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,879
a it's a mediumsized uh egg producer I

116
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,759
think you have they have like a 250,000

117
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:09,759
layers so uh and he is actually a Cornel

118
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:13,520
Alum so he gladly participated providing

119
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:17,759
eggs uh in addition to providing eggs uh

120
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:20,560
he provided also proprietary uh diet we

121
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,598
felt very strongly that the the letin

122
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,720
derived from these eggs was going to

123
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:29,759
depend on the chemical composition of

124
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,560
the diet so he uh provided two types of

125
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,598
chicken feeds that they use in their

126
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:39,598
farms uh uh non EB and EB and those are

127
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:43,079
designations that only they know what

128
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:46,639
they mean right no is proprietary the

129
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:49,478
diet so and then the corresponding eggs

130
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,879
produced with the different uh diets so

131
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:54,680
the methodology utilized is actually

132
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:58,319
extremely simple uh one cracks the egg

133
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,000
separates the yolk and then the yolk is

134
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,319
extracted uh with a mixture of Chlor for

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,199
methanol in 2:1 ratio uh evaporated to

136
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,479
rightness and prepared for sampling and

137
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:14,080
introduction into a mass spectrometer so

138
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,439
at the time in the uh core facility we

139
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,439
had a

140
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:22,038
square uh LC electr spray anization Mass

141
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:25,279
spectrometer that one could actually

142
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:28,478
operate so that was the playground for

143
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,038
us for the next uh three years actually

144
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,038
so uh

145
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:34,560
is a very robust instrument but very

146
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:38,038
limited in capacity of data processing

147
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,319
because it's single octopole and um ion

148
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:44,279
trap but in any event it was very

149
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:47,840
suitable for uh the analysis of dtin so

150
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:50,279
lot of Matthew crank a lot of data and

151
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,198
data processing and this is basically

152
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:56,638
the results that we that we receive mind

153
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,598
you this is uh the average mamalian cell

154
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,280
membrane lipid composition the main

155
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:05,000
component is phosphat choline PC uh

156
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:07,158
followed by phospha ethanolamine and

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,800
then a little bit of phosph

158
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:14,199
inositol so we characterize the

159
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:18,000
composition profile of the feeds uh and

160
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:20,919
compare with a uh sample of commercial

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
letin that is utilized in by the uh

162
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:30,878
pharmaceutical industry as you can see

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,799
um the nonb feed has little pie see uh

164
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,479
large amounts of PE and little Pi uh

165
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:42,799
however the EB feeds have larger amounts

166
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:47,000
of PC uh comparable amounts of PE and

167
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:49,439
both um probably the the the E uh the

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,559
fee that compares best with the green

169
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,160
bars which are the composition of the

170
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:57,079
commercial uh pharmaceutical grade uh

171
00:08:54,159 --> 00:09:00,480
Lestin that contains large amounts of PC

172
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:03,320
is is the one now this is is the profile

173
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,879
of the ler that come from the chickens

174
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:11,040
that were fed one and the other diet and

175
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:13,200
as you can see um very uh they very very

176
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:19,679
different VI the composition of the of

177
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:21,879
the uh of the diets um uh so the

178
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:25,199
composition that is closest to the

179
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:28,559
commercial Lestin is actually uh the

180
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:33,640
eggs that were laid uh from chickens

181
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:36,399
that were uh fed the non EB uh uh

182
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:39,399
chicken feed and it's almost equal to

183
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:44,759
the to the commercial one uh same

184
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:48,759
amounts in PE and uh very little uh Pi

185
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:51,720
so um if we look at the Lestin

186
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:54,639
composition of the eggs that come from

187
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:58,200
uh chickens that were fed the non EV uh

188
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:01,439
diet is very very close to the uh to the

189
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,200
mamalian cell membrane uh composition so

190
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,040
those were the results that we received

191
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,360
and of course we passed on

192
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:13,120
recommendations uh we felt also that you

193
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,839
know the diets can be optimized to

194
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,480
better adjust than the profile needed

195
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,680
for uh suitable use by the

196
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,759
pharmaceutical industry given the fact

197
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:26,039
that uh the the diet it's is very

198
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,958
influential in this composition that's

199
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:31,480
why organic and omega-3 eggs can be

200
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:34,799
produced you just feed those components

201
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,560
to the to the chicken and voila you get

202
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:40,278
eggs that have high content of

203
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:43,239
Omega-3s and just to illustrate that in

204
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:45,480
addition to the uh quantification of the

205
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,720
phospholipid classes we actually did a

206
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,720
very detailed uh species profile for

207
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,440
each one of the classes and this is one

208
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,240
example so for each one of the fosol

209
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,519
lipids we actually identified each one

210
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,320
of the particular species these numbers

211
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,799
represent the added number of carbons

212
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,360
coming from the two acil groups in the

213
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:10,399
in the actual phospholipid including its

214
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:15,680
uh level of ins saturation all right so

215
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:18,078
um uh this actually led to a very robust

216
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:21,638
uh research collaboration with the group

217
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:25,479
of uh Susan Henry that to this day it is

218
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:29,879
maintained and uh in this particular

219
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:33,278
case we actually looked at uh uh

220
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:36,439
lipidomics uh and the lipidome of yeast

221
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:39,519
cells uh and through the manipulation of

222
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,839
uh different uh growth conditions and

223
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,879
the use of gin delit mutants uh we have

224
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:50,279
a better understanding now how these uh

225
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:51,879
metabolic pathways were actually uh

226
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:55,958
regulated

227
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:59,000
so uh we were fortunate that a newer

228
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:02,119
machine and more capable was acquired by

229
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,958
the core facility we now have a triple

230
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,919
uh quadruple machine that can do uh

231
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:10,359
multiple reaction monitoring that allows

232
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:13,719
us in combination with uh hplc to

233
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:17,600
elucidate in one analysis more than 100

234
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,360
uh lipid species in in samples so this

235
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:25,120
is the lipidome of yeast depending on

236
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:27,680
the growth stage we normally work with G

237
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,679
uh populations that are in this

238
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,679
particular uh early

239
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:35,078
uh developmental stage uh and here is

240
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:38,838
the whole profile of lipids cardol

241
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:41,078
lippin uh sterols Singo lipids the

242
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,800
phospholipids neutral lipids and the

243
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:46,278
lyso uh

244
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,838
products uh this uh just an as an

245
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:50,919
example the most important phospholipid

246
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,199
in yeast is

247
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:56,278
phosphoinositol um this is the

248
00:12:53,198 --> 00:13:00,838
composition per species of the steady

249
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:04,360
state uh however uh using now a very in

250
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,000
Innovative U use of the stable isotope

251
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,519
we can actually look at the nov

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,799
synthesis of all this species and

253
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,679
therefore by comparison with the

254
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:17,759
composition of the steady state infer

255
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:20,278
the level of or degree of remodeling

256
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:23,958
that these phospholipids actually uh

257
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:26,879
undergo so so this is this is what we do

258
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:30,239
in combination with all the uh genetics

259
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:34,078
behind the uh uh

260
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,360
yeast so I'm going to move now on to

261
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,679
really what I want to uh spend the rest

262
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,320
of the time discussing that is disease

263
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:44,239
targeted Botanical pharmacology uh these

264
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,639
are the particular diseases that we are

265
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,320
interested in in my lab is it looks very

266
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,120
ambitious but actually uh on a

267
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,000
preliminary stage they're very very

268
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,799
accessible as I will illustrate I will

269
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,839
con actually I will concentrate

270
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,479
primarily only on cancer and the

271
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,839
epigenetics of cancer Alzheimer's

272
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:10,000
disease and a more recent line of

273
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:14,120
research that we have which is uh

274
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,839
menopause so a definition of Botanical

275
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,320
Pharmacology can be the accumulated

276
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,120
developing knowledge of the effect and

277
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,519
motivaction of natural products

278
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,240
occurring in plants in the prevention

279
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,440
and treatment of disease and I feel that

280
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,600
by studying and investigating the mode

281
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,800
of action of a natural product we are

282
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,000
very prepared to provide pharmaceutical

283
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:39,559
industry with lead compounds that can

284
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,919
actually uh result in a uh clinical

285
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,838
clinical

286
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:47,039
therapy so

287
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,560
um uh I would like to every time that I

288
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,480
talk about a line of research I would

289
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,399
like to introduce you know the the

290
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,519
students that participating in them and

291
00:14:53,399 --> 00:15:00,559
uh as you can see progress in this type

292
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:03,759
of uh projects is is punctuated and

293
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:06,359
cumulative and it transcends you know

294
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:12,199
generations of undergrads as they move

295
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:14,600
on uh and that knowledge and skill and

296
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:17,519
methodological capacity is actually

297
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,480
maintain and uh new students are trained

298
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,639
under it so some of the early students

299
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,800
that I had was Douglas Ryan and more

300
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,799
recently Chelsea uh the uh these two

301
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:32,078
grer students are actually senior grad

302
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:36,399
students and programs in Pharmacology

303
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:39,239
Rockefeller and wild Cornell and they're

304
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:45,799
almost done with their with their PHD

305
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:48,799
work so to um introduce our interest in

306
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:50,838
in cancer from the epigenetic standpoint

307
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:54,359
um I have summarized here you know the

308
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:57,000
views of uh the mechanisms of cancer now

309
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,919
the classical view is one in which uh

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,399
the genome has experienced some kind of

311
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:07,639
uh change introduced by mutations uh

312
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,278
deletions of genes or Gene

313
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:12,198
amplifications and this is the classical

314
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:15,318
View and the one that has been more

315
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:18,919
investigated and for which there is more

316
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:21,198
information however there is an evolving

317
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:24,198
alternative View and that is that

318
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:27,240
epigenetic mechanisms can actually and

319
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:29,519
there dysfunctionality can also result

320
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:35,720
in cancer

321
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:38,240
so um mechanisms by wi by which um uh uh

322
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,240
gene expression can take place is by

323
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,278
hone modification DNA metalation and

324
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,839
noncoding RNA so these two hone

325
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,799
modification and DNA metalation actually

326
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,399
have been investigated in the cont of

327
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:54,159
cancer and found out that actually they

328
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:56,958
contribute to the uh on regulat

329
00:16:54,159 --> 00:17:00,120
proliferation of cancer cells and for

330
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,879
those two there are already Two drugs

331
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,798
that are being used clinically to the

332
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:09,359
treatment of certain

333
00:17:03,798 --> 00:17:13,038
hematologic uh uh uh cancers so my

334
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:16,078
interest in particular and in a moment I

335
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:18,919
will you will see why was actually heat

336
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:21,558
Stone modification misregulation of heat

337
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:25,079
Stone modification can lead actually to

338
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:28,639
to the development of cancer so just to

339
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:31,918
remind you um he Stone modification can

340
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,320
OCC occur in particular by a mechanism

341
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,280
of acceleration and de acceleration uh

342
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:40,599
those changes actually are accomplished

343
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,480
by enzymes that we call hone acetylases

344
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:46,480
or hone acetal

345
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:51,079
transferases so uh acetated chromatin

346
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,798
leads to gene silencing uh the acet the

347
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:57,038
acetalation of Chromatin leads to

348
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:59,359
relaxation and accessibility to to gene

349
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,919
expression so Mis regul

350
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:06,000
of this U me of this mechanism actually

351
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:09,960
can result in in cancer and here is

352
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,038
Illustrated so one particular hastone uh

353
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,759
the acetylase that has been identified

354
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:21,119
in a couple of cancers um has uh is c

355
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:23,359
one this is a Maman uh hone DEET so it

356
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:26,359
can DEET hones but it can also the

357
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,719
acetates proteins and Illustrated here

358
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:32,158
or two proteins that actually uh the the

359
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,279
acation of those two proteins can result

360
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:38,799
actually in cancer one protein is

361
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:42,038
p53 that if certain one de acetates

362
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:45,440
deactivates and therefore it precludes

363
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:51,919
uh the mechanism by which a cell that

364
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:55,679
has uh a Le uh uh a DNA that is uh

365
00:18:51,919 --> 00:19:00,280
damaged cannot undergo apotosis or DNA

366
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:03,400
repair or uh growth uh uh cell uh

367
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:06,558
development and that results in tumor

368
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,759
suppression so if that certain one the

369
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,319
acet is actually

370
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:15,839
misregulated it can inactivate or

371
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:19,000
deactivate p53 or on the other hand um

372
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,839
it can actually activate uh an enogen

373
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,720
like

374
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:26,079
bcl6 uh that is actually transcriptional

375
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,679
uh repressor that can result in Toren

376
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:35,038
bcl6 and the acetalation of it has been

377
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:38,360
implicated in uh a particular type of uh

378
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:41,599
lymphoma so there is a c one homologue

379
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:44,759
actually in in yeast and that is Sir 2

380
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:51,439
so sir 2 is also a heat stone that setat

381
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:54,319
and actually uh can um silence uh at uh

382
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:59,440
silence at at the telomeric uh genes at

383
00:19:54,319 --> 00:20:01,960
theic uh region uh uh it's a family of

384
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,120
his deasis C2 is the most important but

385
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,558
it forms complexes with sir three sir

386
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:11,918
four it's a whole that called the cerin

387
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:16,839
and the acation uh actually silences uh

388
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:20,320
chromatin so to to study he Stone the

389
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:23,000
acceleration in the context of finding

390
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:26,519
natural products that can actually

391
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,159
prevent their action and and the

392
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:33,960
treatment of cancer um

393
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,120
we we had a challenge so before I go on

394
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,038
to describe the methodology that we

395
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:43,719
developed to do that uh let me just say

396
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:45,558
that these two uh heat Stone desis small

397
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,759
molecules at the time that we were

398
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:50,158
looking into the possibility of

399
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,319
undertaking this type of project had

400
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,320
actually been

401
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:58,879
identified so um these two chemicals

402
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:00,359
actually were uh critical in deciding

403
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,480
what type of natural products we were

404
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,439
going to Target in the possibility that

405
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,679
we could set up some kind of methodology

406
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,720
to measure his on the satat this

407
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:15,720
particular molecule have been isolated

408
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,720
from a fungal U from a fungal isolate

409
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,079
that was in the repository of the

410
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:24,319
National Cancer Institute and it's

411
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:26,839
called split misin and uh it was found

412
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:30,000
out that it was a hisone acetat of ser2

413
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:32,678
actually in in yeast the other compound

414
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,038
is called Saha for short it's a

415
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:39,080
synthetic compound and in 2006 receive

416
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:42,599
approv approval from the FDA to treat

417
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:45,079
this particular type of uh cell

418
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,000
lymphoma so with this type of chemistry

419
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,439
in the

420
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,880
background and knowing a little of

421
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,240
natural products one could think of

422
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,640
natural product candidates that could be

423
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:03,000
put through uh a an assay to look for

424
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,759
histone dietas uh activity so the

425
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,119
question is you know where and what to

426
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:14,158
look for histone DEET inhib activity

427
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:16,879
so knowing that uh so using this

428
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,640
structures as templates what came to

429
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,520
mind was actually cumerin so cumerin

430
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,440
have this particular basic skeleton this

431
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:29,918
is a uh chromone this is a chrom and own

432
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,200
so you can see right right away uh the

433
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,278
similarity between the two structures so

434
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,679
we decided that cumarin because they

435
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:39,759
bear uh quite close resemblance to spyin

436
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,400
could actually be good candidates for

437
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:46,440
histon inhib so as we know cumans are

438
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:50,038
well distributed the rotas asteras and

439
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:54,278
inoma Pac now the other uh group of

440
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:58,240
natural products uh that were closely

441
00:22:54,278 --> 00:23:01,919
resembling Saha or actually alky amides

442
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,200
okay so um these type of compounds are

443
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,120
wiely distributed in rotas Piper and Som

444
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,440
asteras and as you can see there is an

445
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:17,199
overlap between the presence of cins and

446
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:21,200
alides in the rotasi so grasi became the

447
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:24,600
first uh Target family you know to

448
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,240
investigate for this type of activity so

449
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,158
the question is how are we're going to

450
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,079
do

451
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:36,640
this so so um so here uh we actually I

452
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:40,158
saw the advice of uh the Susan Henry uh

453
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:44,159
group and decided that well if we're

454
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:46,640
going to use yeast to investigate hisia

455
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:51,320
activity then we need to actually

456
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,880
engineer a yeast strain that will have a

457
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:57,720
reported Gene and the reported Gene that

458
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,400
was decided to use was a EUR three uh

459
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,679
reported Gene introduced in the telomic

460
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:09,360
region where the cins hison acasis and

461
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:12,440
yeast actually uh operate so if the uh

462
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:15,519
chromatin is acetated there is no urri

463
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,679
expression uh if it is acetated then

464
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:22,119
there will be urri expression so we need

465
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:26,240
to translate this uh this theoretical uh

466
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:27,879
concept into into practice so okay so

467
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,278
I'm not going to discuss the conditions

468
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,278
that already required for this

469
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:34,720
expression and how the reporting is

470
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:37,640
going to take place uh and I rather uh

471
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,120
described how we accomplish actually

472
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,679
this so the yeast strain that was

473
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:46,519
actually engineered was uh done with a

474
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,480
plasmid that was actually provided by uh

475
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:51,798
Thomas pets from University of North

476
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:56,919
Carolina that contained actually the

477
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:59,599
whole uh uh right arm of chromosome 5 in

478
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,320
which the Ura 3 gen reported Gene had

479
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,839
been introduced in the theric region so

480
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:09,119
by homologous recombination we actually

481
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:12,359
engineer uh a g strain that contain now

482
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:18,278
the reported Gene in the appropriate

483
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:22,398
place so uh now what what is it that Ura

484
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:25,599
3 does well Ur three actually is a uh

485
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:30,599
decarboxylase in the osil B btic pathway

486
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:34,038
from or to uh uracil that removes uh the

487
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:38,240
carboxy uh group from orod 5 phosphate

488
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:42,440
and yielding uh uh yurine mono mono

489
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:46,240
phosphate so um

490
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:50,000
now in this type of methodologies uh one

491
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:54,200
can actually give uh where the gene is

492
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,319
operational we can give the cells this

493
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:00,600
particular compound five floro orotic

494
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:05,879
acid so is is a is ortic acid that has a

495
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:08,918
Florine in this position and if the cell

496
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,840
processes it it results in the formation

497
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:14,240
of this suicide inhibitor which is five

498
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:17,639
floral uh Ur

499
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,519
uracil so depending on whether we allow

500
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:23,679
for you know ur3 to be expressed or not

501
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:28,079
we kill or not cells right so now we

502
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:32,798
have a way to actually uh set a an acid

503
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:37,599
to do that uh so Illustrated here is if

504
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:41,519
the cins uh the acetate uh uh the T the

505
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:44,558
telic region so the cells can actually

506
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,480
uh grow in the presence of 5 foa because

507
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:50,839
ura3 is actually uh

508
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,880
non-expressed but if the cerin the

509
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:55,759
acetate and ura3 is actually expressed

510
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,600
then the cells are not going to grow

511
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,558
because they're going to form this

512
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:04,480
compound which is actually toxic to them

513
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:07,359
so uh that can be done very easily in uh

514
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,399
liquid media but I have always had a

515
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:14,798
tendency to simplify things for

516
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:18,319
expediency and uh what I wanted to uh

517
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,119
develop was a assay on the same basis

518
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:25,519
but that actually could be used in solid

519
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:29,038
media so the concept was if we deposit a

520
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:31,079
heat Stone the cetas in a filter dis and

521
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:34,038
we introduce it in a Petri dis and

522
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:38,079
inoculate with this particular construct

523
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:39,798
will it show cell growth inhibition so

524
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,599
here's the proof of concept nicotinic

525
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:44,960
acid is a histone inhibitor and you can

526
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:48,599
see that in the presence of it there is

527
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,919
no cell growth and without it cells grow

528
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:53,759
so now we have a system rather simple

529
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,000
but at the same time complex because of

530
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,519
the type of reporting that we can

531
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,720
actually now interrogate natural product

532
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,599
chemistry for

533
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,880
hist

534
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:07,359
inovision so as I said the rotasi became

535
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,919
the first uh Target family to

536
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,879
investigate for natural product

537
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:16,320
chemistry that could actually uh inhibit

538
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,159
hison acation so at the time it was

539
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,398
almost winter and so we had to recur to

540
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:25,159
what we had in the greenhouse and we had

541
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:28,239
actually two species of citrus so we had

542
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:32,399
this particular rasi citr forella uh

543
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:35,720
mtis uh conquet and we had actually uh

544
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:38,278
lemon so we prepare actually extracts of

545
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,319
the leaves of these two rotasi and then

546
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:43,119
we put them through the assay and the

547
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:47,319
result was that well the crude chemistry

548
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:51,079
of an methanol extract of uh this rasi

549
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:55,639
actually uh the one from uh the lemon

550
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:57,639
doesn't inhibit the growth of the uh

551
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,440
cell so that means that there is no

552
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:04,759
hstone the C IND division while the

553
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:08,320
extract of Kat does so so we pursue then

554
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:09,759
the chemistry of citings uh mitis uh in

555
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,398
this particular case we were actually

556
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,240
targeting uh and the reason why we

557
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:16,599
tested methanol extracts is because we

558
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:22,480
were targeting the U uh the cumerin in

559
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:26,558
in Citrus so we pursue Sidis and um so

560
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,720
this right away became a big challenge

561
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,918
because we could not reprod produce this

562
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:35,360
biological activity at

563
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:38,840
will and every time that we prepared an

564
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:42,000
extract of uh kumquat and

565
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:44,759
tested we would either get a positive

566
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,519
result or we would not get a result at

567
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:49,879
all and this was very

568
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:53,720
puzzling and after

569
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:56,440
reviewing data accumulated we notice

570
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,919
that the only extracts that were uh

571
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,640
giving a positive result were aged quote

572
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,880
unquote

573
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:08,480
extracts and that that aging required at

574
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,399
least one month of sitting on the bench

575
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,558
if we tried freshly prepared extracts

576
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:16,759
there was no activity at all so this was

577
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,119
actually later confirmed when we started

578
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:19,440
now to suspect that there was a

579
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:21,558
difference between the two types of

580
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,440
extracts okay so we applied the

581
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:28,519
chemistry to that we compare uh

582
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,919
composition hlc composition profiles of

583
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:34,399
old and age extracts and we found that

584
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:39,559
actually uh there was a change in

585
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:43,119
profile in which one compound in the

586
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:46,278
um that was prominent in the fresh

587
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:49,319
extract in the one month old extract

588
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:51,599
actually uh decreased in concentration

589
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:53,839
while another com uh compound actually

590
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:56,759
or component actually experienced the

591
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:59,000
opposite okay so it started with very

592
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,200
low concentrations and after one month

593
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,119
it was actually high this already

594
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,319
suggested to those to us that this

595
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:09,759
changing composition actually was key to

596
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:11,839
the biological activity we further uh

597
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,679
tested that hypothesis using mass

598
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,959
spectrometry and we found in effect

599
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:19,240
there is a compound that in the fresh

600
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,679
extract is very low concentration it has

601
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:26,240
a molecular weight of 377 and after one

602
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,720
month actually is high right so we went

603
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,919
after that compound we did you know

604
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,159
bioet guide fractionation and that

605
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:37,799
actually resulted in uh the elucidation

606
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:41,880
of the active principle that it is only

607
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:45,278
active after the parent compound has

608
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,200
actually produced it in large amounts uh

609
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,679
we don't know the mechanism by which

610
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,360
this change occurs whether it is

611
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:56,600
chemical or biochemical nevertheless uh

612
00:31:53,359 --> 00:32:01,000
it was confirmed here is the comparison

613
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:03,398
of uh the Mass Spectrum of the uh parent

614
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,480
compound and this is the mass spectrum

615
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:08,798
of the product that is the active one

616
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,200
which is the result of the loss of these

617
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:16,879
two uh sugar uh Moes so this

618
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,240
compound which is a cumin uh a Fano

619
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,080
cumerin for that matter is actually a

620
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,720
hone theet inhibitor so uh other

621
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:28,398
students came along and we targeted then

622
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,798
a different uh rageous plant

623
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:33,119
uh santox Americano in this particular

624
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:35,278
case Northern Brickly as occurs in the

625
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:38,678
area we collected it it had been

626
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:42,599
reported that uh santox Americana

627
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:45,759
contain five mop five mop a cumin and

628
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:49,558
this particular alkamide five Alpha

629
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:51,278
hydroxy Sanol so we wanted to find out

630
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:53,519
if either one of these two type of

631
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:57,359
compounds actually were he on the acetal

632
00:32:53,519 --> 00:33:00,240
lasis so extracts actually were prepared

633
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:03,798
uh test he is the response a strong

634
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,960
response to one partially purified uh

635
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:09,798
fraction uh that came from uh colon

636
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,480
chromatography and we further pursu this

637
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:16,319
biological activity and it resulted then

638
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,558
in a fraction that was reach in a family

639
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:23,319
of compounds which are actually

640
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:27,038
derivatives of cuspidal which is a uh

641
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:30,839
fenel propanoid type of compound so we

642
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:33,919
further uh fractionating using uh silic

643
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:37,119
gel colon chromatography gradients uh in

644
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,440
separation we found uh fractions that

645
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:42,158
were active and that by tin

646
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,120
chromatography showed that it was only

647
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,679
one compound they all contain it we

648
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:49,079
combined and tested and the activity is

649
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,880
right there so the compound that was

650
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:55,720
identified by m spectrometry is actually

651
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,880
this cuspidal analog gpic acid that's

652
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,880
what we're calling it and it's actually

653
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:04,399
a uh histone

654
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,840
inhibitor so um we took a different

655
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:12,078
avenue to fractionation of uh sxin

656
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:15,759
Americano uh uh extracts and we isolated

657
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:18,679
also an additional histone theet gamma

658
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,040
Sanu um which it has not it hadn't been

659
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:24,358
reported actually in santox americanum

660
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:27,719
and so here's the structure is it is

661
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:30,239
actually an alide so you know the

662
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:32,480
choosing of the rasi because they

663
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:36,158
combine this typ of chemistry that has

664
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,639
been shown by analogy to be HISD paid

665
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,639
out actually so we have now in summary

666
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:46,280
um a few uh compounds one furan aerin

667
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,119
and one fenel propanoid and actually one

668
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,119
alkamide so all this in the course of

669
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,039
about four

670
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,320
years all right so let me move on now to

671
00:34:54,039 --> 00:35:01,039
to a different uh

672
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,760
disease and this is Alzheimer's um so

673
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:06,599
Alzheimer's uh is becoming a a big

674
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:11,119
problem uh not only in North America but

675
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:14,440
globally as we have an increasing aging

676
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,838
population that it will experience

677
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,320
certain uh incidents of Alzheimer's

678
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,239
disease uh that in combination with the

679
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,640
fact that uh current Therapies in the

680
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:28,199
treatment of Alzheimer disease are

681
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:31,639
actually uh not very efficacious uh

682
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:35,519
clinically so this uh interest in

683
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:38,078
Alzheimer's actually started out in 2009

684
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:40,199
uh uh with these two students Scott and

685
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,240
Michael both of them already were

686
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:48,000
awarded their MD degrees uh and newer

687
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:50,078
students like Bernell and and Ry um any

688
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,440
event so uh this is the uh

689
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,160
neuropathology of Alzheimer's uh very

690
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,599
early on uh upon postmortem uh studies

691
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,879
it was actually found out that an

692
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,960
Alzheimer's patient brain actually has

693
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,039
experienced considerable shrinkage and

694
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,000
you know neuronal loss mainly occurs in

695
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:13,358
the Cal cortex in the hippocampal uh

696
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,039
region where the coleric uh Network

697
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:19,598
resides and the coleric network actually

698
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,920
is responsible for memory and cognition

699
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,599
so as you can see affecting these parts

700
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,800
of the brain results in loss of those

701
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,880
two

702
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,240
functions so um histological

703
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,280
preparations had also shown that

704
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:34,879
associated with this neuronal law or the

705
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,720
formation of plaques that now we call

706
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,720
them aoid beta ameloid plaques and also

707
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:43,358
accumulation of protein to protein fals

708
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:47,118
inside of the cells all right all that

709
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:50,519
causes Alzheimer's disease So based on

710
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:53,920
these results and B chemical studies of

711
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:56,880
uh uh brains of Alzheimer's individuals

712
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,480
it was noted actually that levels of

713
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,240
acetycholine the

714
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,400
neurotransmitter uh in these areas of

715
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:09,159
the brain was actually very low so the

716
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:14,358
first hypothesis or model proposed for

717
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:17,358
the disease was one in which uh

718
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:20,759
uh the result the Alzheimer's disease

719
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:23,480
was actually the result of a low

720
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:27,280
concentration of aetl choline in this

721
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:30,119
synaptic Cliff between two neurons right

722
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:33,200
so so acetyl choline is actually made

723
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:36,240
from acetate and choline by a choline

724
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:38,838
acetal trans phrase and degraded by an

725
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:41,358
enzyme that is called acet Colin estras

726
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:44,519
all right so

727
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:47,358
um when acet Coline is released into the

728
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:49,639
synaptic Cliff uh Finds Its way into

729
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:52,960
receptors which are in the post synaptic

730
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:55,639
uh neuron one of them uh the muscarinic

731
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:00,760
acetal Coline receptor is actually a g

732
00:37:55,639 --> 00:38:01,960
protein coupled uh uh receptor and so it

733
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,800
was then

734
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:08,119
proposed that that signaling Cascade

735
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:11,160
that resulted from that interaction

736
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:15,119
actually was affecting the processing of

737
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:19,358
AP which is the protein that actually uh

738
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:21,240
is the precursor to the uh beta ameloid

739
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:24,159
peptide which Aggregates into the

740
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:25,479
plaques so the coleric hypothesis that

741
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:30,318
was proposed in

742
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:33,960
1975 blamed low amounts of aeroline in

743
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:38,079
the synaptic cleff uh for the production

744
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,960
of the beta ameloid peptide so from this

745
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,960
model it was very clear what the

746
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,639
solution was well then develop a drug

747
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,599
that could actually restore normal

748
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:52,199
levels of atic Colin in synaptic cliff

749
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,519
and that Target was actually the Colinas

750
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:57,799
uh the acetal Coline estras the enzyme

751
00:38:54,519 --> 00:39:01,880
that degrades acetal choline so the

752
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:05,800
first and only generation of actually uh

753
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:08,760
drugs um what they do is they block the

754
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,440
activity of acetal Colin estras uh

755
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,800
restoring normal levels of acetal

756
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,519
choline in the synaptic cleff and

757
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,440
clinically it was predicted that if that

758
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:21,920
was the case then Downstream uh the

759
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,519
production of beta ameloid peptide was

760
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,000
going to decrease and the progression of

761
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:28,960
the disorder was going to slow down

762
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
right so this or the drugs that are

763
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,440
current in current use so the col

764
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,679
energic hypothesis was proposed in

765
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:43,920
1975 uh the first drugs that came uh

766
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:47,919
into the uh CL into clinical use uh

767
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,440
where arisp and rivastigmine this

768
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,920
compound is completely synthetic this is

769
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,519
actually derived from a natural product

770
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:59,960
fos sine that occurs in a African uh

771
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:02,639
legume which is actually very toxic so

772
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,599
the other compound actually or the other

773
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:08,838
a is Colin esteras inhibitor uh approved

774
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:12,960
in 2004 is galantamine that actually

775
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:15,039
occurs in a host of plants I just cited

776
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,039
daff deal because it's very timely right

777
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:21,719
now to talk about that uh so uh and is

778
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:24,519
uh it is used as it is found actually in

779
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:27,318
in these plants there is an alternative

780
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:30,039
treatment that uh blocks actually the

781
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:31,960
the receptor of glutamate which it is

782
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:34,838
thought to contribute to the formation

783
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,920
of the to protein feals in the in the

784
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:41,159
neurons and this is all that exists uh

785
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,639
in clinical use and their efficacy is

786
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:47,199
actually extremely poor

787
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:51,000
right so given the interest that we had

788
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,679
in this um in this uh and I'm going to

789
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,400
start to abbreviate because I'm I'm

790
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:58,519
running out of time now uh so we started

791
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,720
to uh so we decided to look for aceras

792
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:03,318
Inhibitors so the question was what type

793
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:07,719
of plants are we going to look for to uh

794
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:10,559
to screen for ainer inion so the plants

795
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:12,439
that we decided to Target were plants

796
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,239
that have been claimed to possess

797
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:18,440
neurotropic activity and neurot Tropics

798
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:21,559
are defined you know as agents that can

799
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,358
be or act as uh memory enhancers neuro

800
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:26,838
enhancers cognitive enhancers Etc and

801
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:28,318
the anobot are rich in those types of

802
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:30,639
description

803
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,599
so uh so the question now was how are we

804
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:35,199
going to measure this well we had

805
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:38,920
actually a fluorometric asset to do it

806
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:42,159
but it just was too uh it was not very

807
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:46,599
practical to to use it uh it is very

808
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:49,960
good at quantitating uh activity uh and

809
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,760
Gathering uh kinetics uh but not very

810
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,480
quick for targeting a particular

811
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,119
component in in a plant so we opted to

812
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,960
use an alternative which is a uh bio

813
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,440
autographic a say that can be uh

814
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:09,000
developed in a uh thin layer

815
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:11,318
chromatogram uh it entails the uh uh

816
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,960
resolving the components of a mixture on

817
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:18,279
T on TLC applying the enzyme and then a

818
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:21,079
reagent that generates a background and

819
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:24,280
contrasts with a discoloration which is

820
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:26,480
actually an indicator of acetal Colinas

821
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:31,280
inivision and here's the proof of

822
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:33,960
concept this is the assay and this uh

823
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,480
whitish uh discoloration here is

824
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,639
actually arisp the drug that is used

825
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,960
clinically so now we had an assay and we

826
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:44,400
decided then on what plant we were going

827
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,760
to Target so one of the first plants

828
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,880
that we actually targeted was um MAA

829
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,640
lepidum mayai and andian

830
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,000
braiki uh that traditionally is used for

831
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:58,719
the treatment of male infertility but

832
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,039
that it lists as an benefit actually

833
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:04,879
Improvement in memory and and brain

834
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:07,679
function so this is the aay as it looks

835
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,358
so we diagnos that these areas of

836
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:14,639
discoloration in particular uh were due

837
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:17,078
to uh alkaloids in in MAA as we got a

838
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:19,639
positive with dragon DF reagent which is

839
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:22,839
highly specific for alkaloids and we

840
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:25,118
went on to isolate those components and

841
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:26,639
I'm not going to discuss in depth but

842
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,400
these are the types of alkaloids that

843
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:32,558
are found in in MAA they're very unique

844
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,880
Idol type of alkaloids surprisingly uh

845
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:38,000
MAA this brassicaceous plant contains

846
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,800
also alkamides and they're all AAL

847
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,920
Colinas Inhibitors so it could be the

848
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,240
foundation for the claim you know that

849
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,880
MAA probably benefits memory and and

850
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,598
function so another plant that we

851
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,280
another neotropic plant that we targeted

852
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:56,519
also is lemon Bal Bel falis in the lamia

853
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:00,359
that there's a claim that alleviates uh

854
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:03,880
m Alzheimer's so is the acin estras

855
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:06,358
inhibition uh aay these are the spots

856
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,680
that we targeted there are others but we

857
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:10,838
felt that this was the major component

858
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:13,159
it's a phenolic compound as it gives

859
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:15,480
positive with feric chloride and

860
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:18,279
ultimately we decided that very likely

861
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:21,159
this compound was rosmarinic acid we run

862
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,599
hlc analysis compared with an authentic

863
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:26,078
sample of rosar neaz and sure enough

864
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,920
it's there in the in the in the extracts

865
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:34,200
of the plant and confirmed by mass

866
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,000
spectrometry so um so these are the in

867
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:39,439
sumary these are the ass called Nas

868
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:43,639
Inhibitors that uh we have isolated uh

869
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:48,800
one alkamide and two alkaloids from uh

870
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:51,960
lepidium Ai and one um fenel propanoid

871
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,680
in meliss officinalis rosmarinic acid

872
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:58,240
okay so lastly I'm just going to briefly

873
00:44:54,679 --> 00:45:00,558
discuss um menopause and our interest in

874
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,838
menopause and actually is an extension

875
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:07,640
of uh the Alzheimer's disease interest

876
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:11,599
that we have so uh participants in this

877
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:15,960
uh uh project or uh research is Maryanne

878
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:19,119
kumal Janet and and Heather so we had

879
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,199
interest in actually uh

880
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,680
phytoestrogens um for a number of

881
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:27,399
reasons uh one of them was very

882
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:30,039
pragmatic and that is well uh this

883
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,960
particular group of plants have been

884
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:35,558
utilized for a purported estrogenic

885
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,119
activity these two black cohos and red

886
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:41,240
clover have been utilized in alternative

887
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:43,559
treatment of menopause

888
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,959
symptomatology these other two actually

889
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,079
have been used traditionally as

890
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,480
galactoses to increase uh breast meal

891
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:55,000
production in lactating women so um we

892
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:57,679
felt that these two types of uh effects

893
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,920
were caused by the presence of

894
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:03,118
uh estrogen mimics so uh but at the same

895
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,838
time we felt that the there was no

896
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,720
really uh good hold on the estrogenic

897
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:12,719
chemistry chemistry had been described

898
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:15,078
but not never uh conclusively

899
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:18,000
demonstrated that those reported

900
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:19,800
compounds were the phytoestrogens so in

901
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,880
a revisionist type of approach we

902
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,400
decided okay let's look again at these

903
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,800
plants we have now a uh an interest we

904
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:31,838
have plants to look at all we needed now

905
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:37,119
was to um uh to find out how how can we

906
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:39,199
do this so uh so menopause is um a age

907
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,160
related biological phenomenon results in

908
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,118
the reproductive cap and the loss of the

909
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:44,719
reproductive capacity of a woman and is

910
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,200
caused by gradual decrease in estrogen

911
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:51,759
production in the ovaries so

912
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:54,759
uh as we review the literature and we're

913
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:59,160
getting ready to investigate uh estrogen

914
00:46:54,760 --> 00:47:03,240
mimic uh activity we realize that

915
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:05,399
estrogen was actually integral to uh a

916
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:08,639
number of symptoms associated with

917
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,720
menopause so they're the classical ones

918
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:15,558
uh and there are the result from that uh

919
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:18,118
decrease in in estrogen and uh decrease

920
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:21,319
in uh progesterone but one thing

921
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,680
actually cut our interest cited amongst

922
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:25,119
the umbrella designation of

923
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:28,919
psychological symptoms was actually poor

924
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,920
memory and that cut up our interest so

925
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,599
how how is this I mean what is the

926
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:37,800
relationship between loss of memory or

927
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,838
decline in memory and estrogen well um

928
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,359
there are a number of studies that

929
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,799
actually have conclusively demonstrated

930
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:46,799
that there is an association between or

931
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,640
correlation between the progression of

932
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,760
menopause and the decline and memory and

933
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:54,199
cognitive function so this is one of the

934
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,359
more recent ones published in 2013

935
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:57,558
conducted at the University of uh

936
00:47:56,358 --> 00:47:59,920
Rochester

937
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:02,920
which a group of middle-aged women in

938
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,079
different stages of menopause will

939
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,639
actually tested physiologically and

940
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:10,160
psychologically for verbal learing

941
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:12,078
capacity verbal memory F modal skills

942
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:15,679
and attention working memory and as you

943
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,440
can see uh These Bars represent the

944
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:19,799
women the groups of women in the

945
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,240
different stages and as you can

946
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:28,039
see especially in veral memory there is

947
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:31,199
a decline associated with uh progression

948
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:34,239
uh of of menopause and it's true for all

949
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:36,679
of the other uh functions uh that

950
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:39,399
actually were measured so here we have

951
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:42,679
actually a very concrete evidence that

952
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:46,160
there two are associated so now

953
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:49,279
mechanistically why is that uh why is

954
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:51,838
that well looking at the literature we

955
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,880
now uh been able to summarize some of

956
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:57,719
the brain functions that estrogen

957
00:48:53,880 --> 00:49:02,559
actually uh performs in the brain

958
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:05,159
so estrogen actually is a regulator of

959
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:08,359
the enzyme that biosynthesizes

960
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:10,078
acetylcholine right so the enzyme is uh

961
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:14,440
choline acetal

962
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:18,599
transferase so um so this enzyme is

963
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:21,318
under positive uh regulation of estrogen

964
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:24,798
so the other function of estrogen is

965
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:29,960
envisioned as regulating the processing

966
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:33,440
of AP and via the modulation of the

967
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:36,119
enzymes that cleave AP and in the

968
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,880
presence of estrogen the amyloidogenic

969
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:40,079
pathway that leads to the formation of

970
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,358
the ameloid plaques is actually

971
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,798
downregulated and the third property is

972
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:47,078
actually if you notice a ring of

973
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:50,358
estrogen is aromatic with a hydroxy

974
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:52,798
group this compound is antioxidant so it

975
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:56,000
performs also a neuroprotective function

976
00:49:52,798 --> 00:49:57,159
in the brain now if you remove estrogen

977
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,880
from the brain

978
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:03,078
all this happens okay the protection as

979
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:06,798
antioxidant is lost the U regulation of

980
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:09,920
chat is lost less AET coling is produced

981
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:12,318
and it actually increases the risk in a

982
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,680
woman to develop Alzheimer's disease and

983
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:16,358
we know very clearly the statistics

984
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:18,679
women are at twice the risk of

985
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:24,598
developing Alzheimer's disease than men

986
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:26,358
all right so this actually uh led us to

987
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:31,000
formulate a different approach to the

988
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:33,598
study of estrogens and um because of uh

989
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,079
the role of estrogen in in menopause and

990
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,798
what we're looking for now is what I

991
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:42,000
call combinatorial pharmacology imp

992
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:45,400
plants that is chemistry imp plants that

993
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:49,559
can act as an antioxidant that can act

994
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:52,920
as a promoter of AET Coline uh formation

995
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:54,880
and that can act as an estrogen mimic to

996
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,519
reduce the risk of developing

997
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,160
Alzheimer's disease right so so we have

998
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:02,480
encounter now uh actually those plants

999
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,798
uh this is how we uh assay for

1000
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,240
estrogenic activity we engineered

1001
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:09,079
another again another yeast cell with

1002
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:12,318
this particular plasmid that contains

1003
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:14,720
the human estrogen receptor and a beta

1004
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:17,000
galactosidase report a gene so the

1005
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:21,679
plasmid is introduced in the cell and we

1006
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:24,039
have now an engineer uh yeast uh cell

1007
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:26,199
that upon the stimulus of estrogen or an

1008
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:28,639
estrogen mimic actually triggers the

1009
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:31,279
expression of beta galactosidase that

1010
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:33,239
process ompg to OMP that we can measure

1011
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,440
then spectrophotometrically here is the

1012
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:39,598
proof of concept

1013
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:42,639
um such a construct treated with

1014
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:45,920
estrogen uh results in a positive

1015
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:48,440
response all right so uh the first plant

1016
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:53,680
that we actually uh approach for study

1017
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:56,960
is uh fenek a uh Fai um used since

1018
00:51:53,679 --> 00:52:00,039
acquity for a number of reasons uh but

1019
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:03,159
is used actually as a galactogogue uh

1020
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:06,558
prominently uh to increase uh lactation

1021
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:08,598
uh in in women so I'm not going to I'm

1022
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,160
just going to go to the to the

1023
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:13,720
results and the chemistry that we have

1024
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:17,000
actually isolated and identify

1025
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:19,879
conclusively so uh one estrogenic

1026
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,880
component of enog Greek is actually D

1027
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:26,280
genin we isolate it characterize it and

1028
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,160
evaluate it is estrogenic activity is in

1029
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:33,400
the chloroform ethanol extract and in

1030
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:37,558
the aous ethanol extract of U uh fenor

1031
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:39,720
Greek actually we isolated uh three

1032
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:44,160
isoflavones which are actually the same

1033
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:46,000
three isoflavones plus present in soy

1034
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,519
and we know that these isoflavones I

1035
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,280
mean have a

1036
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:54,079
estrogenic uh mimicking capacity so

1037
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,880
they're present also in fenugreek and

1038
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,240
the presence of this chemistry is

1039
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,838
actually resp responsible for the

1040
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:03,639
estrogenic activity we now have defined

1041
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:07,798
a larger group of plants uh to study uh

1042
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:10,000
the uh junior undergrad students that

1043
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:12,480
are working in this project uh have

1044
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,838
already established estrogenic activity

1045
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,400
antioxidant activity uh and aeres

1046
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:19,480
inhibition activity and they're the

1047
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,960
process of isolating the active

1048
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:27,039
principles in this plant all of them in

1049
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:29,119
the uh lamac primarily salvas which are

1050
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:31,199
uh or have been shown to be uh

1051
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,519
estrogenic now I'm going to stop there

1052
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:35,519
uh I just want to

1053
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:39,559
acknowledge see I knew that I had too

1054
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:43,358
many slides so this is this is uh this

1055
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:47,000
is a summary of of um chemistry that is

1056
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:51,078
estrogenic and acet Colin estras uh

1057
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:54,960
inhib inhibitory so the isoflavans and

1058
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:59,079
diine the estrogen mimic in in Fen Greek

1059
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:03,639
um uh and and another plant that we have

1060
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:06,559
studied is aan TR spum Ami in the apaz

1061
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:09,798
that contains estrogen mimics uh folic

1062
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:13,480
acids all of them which also show acolin

1063
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:16,480
estras um activity uh I would like just

1064
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:18,119
to acknowledge the rest of the uh

1065
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,000
undergrad students that have worked in

1066
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:22,760
my life throughout the years I didn't

1067
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,679
get the chance to to talk about their uh

1068
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,880
projects in chemical ecology malaria

1069
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:31,039
diabetes and and cancer all of them

1070
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:33,200
already in graduate school thank you for

1071
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:33,199
your

1072
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:40,558
attention this has been a production of
