1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,360
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,120
University um my goal today is to to

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,879
share a few things with you to get you

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,239
thinking about your teaching um and I

5
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:18,879
know that some of you are faculty and

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,358
are currently in teaching roles and some

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,160
of you are graduate students and

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,800
probably will be in teaching roles at

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,000
some point so I hope to to get you

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,880
thinking about some things um I'm

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,559
probably not going to go as deep as some

12
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:31,198
of you might like to think but I can

13
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:32,479
certainly recommend some resources if

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,039
you want to look at some of these topics

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,159
at a little bit deeper level um I do

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,439
plan to have some interactivity built in

17
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:42,078
and so hopefully you came prepared with

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,679
the mindset of at least being open to

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,039
some discussion and some questioning and

20
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,719
so we'll see where that

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,920
leads so first I want to pose a question

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,840
to you and we're going to do a think

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,280
pair share and I think that if I

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,359
understand from Travis that you guys

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,920
learned about some of these active

26
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,640
learning strategies a little while ago

27
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,198
um but we'll pose the question to you

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,079
I'll let you think about it for a second

29
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:04,438
then you can pair up with someone around

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,719
you and then uh we'll have a few of you

31
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,519
share some of those so the question is

32
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,640
in your classes what does it look like

33
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,560
when students are getting it and so

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,560
think about that for a

35
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,158
second okay so let's go ahead and pair

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,720
up and and share what you think with

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,719
someone around

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,200
you okay let's let's rejoin let's come

39
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:33,478
back together

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,759
and so what were what were some of the

41
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:36,359
things that you guys were discussing

42
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,599
what does it look like when students are

43
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,599
getting it if you can I have a few

44
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,599
volunteers to to

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,560
share yes yeah students are volunteering

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,159
and asking questions okay so the

47
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,799
students are volunteering they're asking

48
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,079
their own questions they're you can tell

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,479
it because they're they're really

50
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,758
engaged okay what

51
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,840
else

52
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:01,519
physically oh okay I get

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,280
it yeah body language also communicating

54
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,599
that they're getting it moving forward

55
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,439
and eye contact yeah so you're kind of

56
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,239
reading their their body language and

57
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:12,159
and their the psychological signs that

58
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,480
they're they're giving good and so I I

59
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,000
won't ask this question but you can

60
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,238
probably as you were thinking about that

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,479
we're also thinking what's it look like

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,599
when they're not getting it well

63
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,959
hopefully today I'm going to give you

64
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,598
some things to think about so that we

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,479
can really generate this more in your

66
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,238
classes as opposed to the frustrating

67
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,399
times when students aren't getting and

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,280
so um I'm going to frame my my

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,680
discussion this morning around five

70
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,120
principles and there are a few handouts

71
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,519
out and around and and so you can feel

72
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,878
free to jot down a few extra things if

73
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,319
you want um but five principles that I

74
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:45,878
think will help you create meaningful

75
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,439
learning experiences uh in your classes

76
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:48,679
so my objectives for today are we're

77
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,959
going to describe the principles of

78
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,959
experiential learning and then

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,878
ultimately uh I'm going to encourage you

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,598
guys at the end to think about your own

81
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,158
teaching whether it's your teaching now

82
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:59,878
or whether you'll have a teaching role

83
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,598
in the future about what are some things

84
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,120
things that you can do in your own

85
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:05,598
teaching to to make it more meaningful

86
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,879
for your

87
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:11,119
students so principle one learning

88
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,798
begins with the existing knowledge and

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,599
experiences of the learner learning

90
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,599
begins with the existing knowledges and

91
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:22,798
experiences of the learn and so I'll let

92
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,798
you read this a little

93
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,318
bit

94
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:33,878
so is this what we think about our our

95
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,598
students they're just a brain on a stick

96
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:38,199
and nothing else

97
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,199
matters no not really I mean really it's

98
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,958
it's this stuff this is what makes us

99
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,199
uniquely human are those individual

100
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,120
experiences and aspirations and goals

101
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:49,000
and and so I would contend that one of

102
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,879
the things we ought to be doing as as

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,680
instructors is getting to know this

104
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,199
student I mean we still want to care

105
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,000
about this one at least this part of

106
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,039
this one but getting to getting to know

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,039
this student so we know who are our

108
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,759
students where do they want to go where

109
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:04,679
what do they want to be what are what do

110
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,039
they already know what are the

111
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,120
experiences they

112
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:12,598
have second thing I want to bring up

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,158
is there is no such thing as a blank

114
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,959
slate there's no such thing as a blank

115
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:19,358
slate so whether no matter what you're

116
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,840
teaching your students are coming to you

117
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:25,719
with some level of understanding or

118
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,519
perhaps misunderstanding of the concepts

119
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,479
that you're trying to teach there is no

120
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,120
blank slate and so if if we go into the

121
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,680
learning environment thinking that

122
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,759
there's a blank slate we're starting at

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,000
a disadvantage it's really about trying

124
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,479
to figure out what is on their slate and

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,600
building off of that as opposed to

126
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:46,279
starting from scratch so principle

127
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,320
number one learning begins with the

128
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:52,159
existing knowledge and

129
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:54,240
experiences of the learner and so let me

130
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,919
pose a question to you so based on

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,360
principle number one what are some

132
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,799
things you might think about trying to

133
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,439
do in your classes to to capture

134
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,439
principle number

135
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,160
one do some kind of assessment at the

136
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,680
beginning of class to see what students

137
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,360
know already already excellent idea so

138
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,519
do some sort of an assessment whether

139
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,479
it's formal or informal to kind of

140
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,839
gather what the students know okay one

141
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,240
more idea you might do in your

142
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,079
classes try to relate material to what

143
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,800
they know yeah so have them try to

144
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:31,240
connect with the new stuff you're giving

145
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,120
had them try to connect with what they

146
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,519
already know and that will help you do

147
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,280
that I do an activity with some of my

148
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,159
classes called a concept map any of you

149
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,478
guys familiar with a concept map it's

150
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,880
kind of a a a way to organize thoughts

151
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,519
and so um actually The Graduate course I

152
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,918
teach on experiential learning I do this

153
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,918
very activity at the very beginning of

154
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,799
the semester I had them create their

155
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:53,799
concept map about how people learn and

156
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,439
then at the end of the semester I have

157
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,918
them recreate that concept map and then

158
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,120
I give them back the first one that they

159
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,719
did so they can see the growth in their

160
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,600
own understanding of how people learn so

161
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,880
it's all all about what they know and

162
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,439
what they bring to the environment okay

163
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,038
so there are no blank slates that was

164
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:11,038
principle number

165
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:19,439
one principle number two learning is a

166
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,639
cyclical process it's a cyclical process

167
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,598
and I'm going to walk you through a a

168
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,478
series of little videos to kind of help

169
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:29,839
us think about maybe a learning cycle

170
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,279
that we might share in common that we

171
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,159
have been

172
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:38,038
through and so I'll pose this question

173
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,280
to you how did you learn to ride a bike

174
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:41,560
and so I want you to think about that

175
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,559
for a sec and kind of recreate some

176
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,560
memories or pull some memories out of of

177
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,959
the file storage to think about what it

178
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,240
was like when you learned to ride a bike

179
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,359
and then I've got a series of short

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,519
video clips that I think might

181
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,520
demonstrate what some of us have

182
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:05,120
experienced okay so I would propose that

183
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,319
step one for many of us well let me ask

184
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,280
before I give you what I think let me

185
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,879
ask you guys what you think so what was

186
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,679
what what was step one for you guys in

187
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,680
learning how to ride a

188
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:19,638
bike I have no rec no recollection could

189
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:23,079
you could you creating the wheel in some

190
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:25,478
people's well that would that would be a

191
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,839
precursor um because the wheel is is a

192
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:30,000
critical component of a bicycle other

193
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,038
thoughts yeah getting beautiful purple

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,439
bike that I wanted to learn how to ride

195
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:36,360
so getting that first bike that you

196
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,560
really wanted to ride other

197
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,879
memories so seeing other people ride

198
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,879
bikes okay any other ideas yeah my dad

199
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,080
holding the back of the seat yeah yep I

200
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,919
think many of us have similar memories

201
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,560
to that and so all great and and you're

202
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,959
going to see most of those things maybe

203
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,319
with the exception of creating the wheel

204
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,399
in these video clips that I'm going to

205
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,039
to show you and so let me start with

206
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,439
this one and I think we've got this

207
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:03,279
where it's going to work out

208
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:05,439
right I know it's hard was

209
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,478
helping what you

210
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,598
say can I help you a little bit you need

211
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,878
to use your legs you got to push with

212
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:11,878
your

213
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:20,319
leg okay you do it you got to push hard

214
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:23,039
push be like there very good very

215
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,520
good okay and so I would propose that

216
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,839
that might have been step one and that

217
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,799
might have been when we got that first

218
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,598
tricycle okay and we probably did see

219
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,278
someone ride the bike before we got to

220
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,879
this stage so maybe this is step two

221
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,038
really other than step one but what are

222
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,399
some things that we probably had to

223
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,598
learn about riding a bike when we are at

224
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,599
this

225
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:47,679
stage coordination coordination okay

226
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,080
Travis how muscle tone yeah I mean the

227
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,639
pedal it's it's a little bit different

228
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,120
motion it's not walking it's a little

229
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,039
bit different motion okay what else

230
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,080
might we have learned at this

231
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,639
stage yeah a little bit of balance I

232
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,320
mean the tricycle has a little bit more

233
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,958
balance than a two whe bike but still

234
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,040
you can't lean way over or way back

235
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,958
because you'll fall off okay what about

236
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,439
stopping on the tricycle how do you stop

237
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:09,639
on a

238
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,760
tricycle either yeah you pedal revers or

239
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,399
just stop pedaling or you put your feet

240
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:17,078
down okay so that I would propose that

241
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,839
might be step one and so now I'll bring

242
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:19,838
you to step

243
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,120
two

244
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:35,639
maybe TR to bre okay show me how you

245
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,639
ped

246
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,679
I okay and so step two is when we got

247
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,240
that that new bike that it was a two

248
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,559
wheel bike but it had training wheels on

249
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,759
it and so what are some things that we

250
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,078
probably had to learn when we were at

251
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,078
step

252
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,120
two steering yeah steering's a little

253
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:59,399
bit different on on that you know on the

254
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,078
tricycle the pedals are on the front

255
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,879
wheel whereas the pedals are back

256
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:06,519
further on those bikes what else do we

257
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,240
have to learn at at step

258
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:12,120
two the brakes right and what kind of

259
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,000
brakes do the those kind of bikes have

260
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,078
pedal yeah right you push back on the

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,720
pedal and when you get good you can

262
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:18,439
leave the skid marks on the

263
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,560
driveway okay what else do we have to

264
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,440
learn at that

265
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,799
stage how get on AER yeah it's bigger

266
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,680
it's up a little bit higher how to get

267
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,599
on okay what else maybe one more

268
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,479
thing this side of the room this side of

269
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,480
the room hasn't been as

270
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,639
as where where you can ride you might be

271
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,000
able to go yeah so you might get a

272
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,399
little bit more freedom particularly as

273
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,440
you get a little bit older mom or dad or

274
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,278
whoever lets you get a little bit more

275
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,120
freedom okay so our our our travel

276
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,919
through the bicycle riding Academy is

277
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,399
continuing this is

278
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:54,559
not keep going keep

279
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,559
going I'll

280
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:02,039
restart okay and so step three

281
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,720
was the day that the training wheels

282
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,399
came off and of course when I ask that

283
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,120
question that's usually where the people

284
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,000
go is the you know Mom or Dad holding on

285
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,480
to the back so what what what did we

286
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
have to learn the day that the training

287
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,399
wheels came

288
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,480
off balance balance right and balance is

289
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,639
really critical when you don't have the

290
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,879
training wheels okay what else do we

291
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,278
have to learn at that stage you have to

292
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,879
maintain a certain speed you do you have

293
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:25,200
to maintain a certain speed because even

294
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,439
if you've got well there's a few people

295
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,759
that can bounce standing still but I'm

296
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,760
not one of them but yeah you got to

297
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,679
maintain some level of speed

298
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,958
or you fall over what else we have to

299
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,399
learn at that one yeah tipping over

300
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,719
doesn't me you're not cut off yeah

301
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,919
because most of us were there right most

302
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,639
of us tipped over a time or two and of

303
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,078
course we had some trust issues with Mom

304
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,399
or Dad hanging on to the back because

305
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,479
you know they and you know those of you

306
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,360
with children probably went through this

307
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,240
with your own children is you know they

308
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,120
make you promise to not let go of course

309
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,519
what do we do we let go every time and

310
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,799
then I promise I won't let go this time

311
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,959
and we let go again and so so it's kind

312
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,120
of where we're working through that

313
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,119
cycle and we're getting better and

314
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,359
better so now I say we move on to step

315
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,240
four so so step

316
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:25,000
four step four we we we were a little

317
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,839
bit braver and those boundaries are a

318
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,679
little bit further out so what do what

319
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,800
we have to lose lose what do we have to

320
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:35,919
learn at at step four wear a helmet

321
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:38,278
safety yeah wear a helmet safety what

322
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,719
else we're probably getting faster

323
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,039
what's that look out for other yeah look

324
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,399
out for our surroundings we're probably

325
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,319
getting faster we're probably getting a

326
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,519
little bit older so Mom or Dad probably

327
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,720
gave us a little bit more room to

328
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,759
stretch out you let us take a few more

329
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,079
risks of course sometimes with the rist

330
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:55,519
comes those sorts of things and so you

331
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:57,239
know we after we run into our friend and

332
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,919
we get up and we get a bandaid on our

333
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,159
elbow or whatever else and then we get

334
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,240
back on the bike and we learn to well

335
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,559
next time maybe we need to look out

336
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,560
where we're

337
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,800
going okay so now let's see what's on

338
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,799
step

339
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,440
five ah what happens at step

340
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,000
five now that one that one was stag

341
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,958
because I have not found a great video

342
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,360
for this yet but step five was when we

343
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,319
got that first bigger bike right and and

344
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,800
what did the what do the bigger bikes

345
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,399
have that the smaller bikes don't have

346
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,319
yeah everyone's handlebar brakes right

347
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,240
and what did we learn is a critical

348
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,000
piece of information related to

349
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,799
handlebar breakes apply both at the same

350
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,360
apply both at the same time or if you're

351
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,439
only going to apply one which one do you

352
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,120
apply the rear because what happens if

353
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,839
you apply only the

354
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,480
front yeah and how did we learn that

355
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,880
either intentionally or unintentionally

356
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,320
we did something like that right we

357
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,679
flipped off and we said ah oh okay okay

358
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,480
I better not do that again let me just

359
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:05,479
work on the back breakes cool thing

360
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,759
about that is learning

361
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,360
to yeah yeah that one that you you could

362
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,720
tell that kid had practiced a little bit

363
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,278
he is he was he was there now I would

364
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,320
contend that our our journey through

365
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,320
bike riding is still

366
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:31,039
[Music]

367
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,039
growing

368
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,639
okay a lot of wind noise on that one so

369
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,159
that was that was just a person riding a

370
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,000
bike on a leisurely thing now how many

371
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,399
of you would say that even if you

372
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,399
haven't been on a bike in a couple of

373
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,278
years that you could probably handle

374
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,480
that today at least on level ground

375
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,720
maybe not on some of the hills you guys

376
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,000
have around here but on level ground so

377
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,360
most of us would say we can we can do

378
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,320
that with reasonable thing we we've

379
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,039
reached that level um although I don't

380
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,680
know about this campus our campus the

381
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,519
bicyclists are crazy you about have to

382
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:04,679
chase them around to you know I had a

383
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,198
professor when I was an undergrad used

384
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,879
to carry a golf club and he was Infamous

385
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,559
for carrying this golf club around

386
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,320
campus and anytime someone got close to

387
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:13,719
me start swinging this golf club because

388
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,278
he he wanted the bikes to stay away from

389
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,920
him because they will zoom up right

390
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:21,078
behind him but so most of

391
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:23,879
us most of us probably have skill levels

392
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:26,638
similar to that we could with a moderate

393
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,240
amount of success get on a bike and and

394
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,680
travel across campus now would is that

395
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,959
the Pinnacle of bike riding

396
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:37,239
skill I see some head shaking those so

397
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,039
what might be a next level of bike

398
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,839
riding skill what are some examples

399
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:46,639
riding up oh riding up the hill

400
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,120
yeah P oh yeah clip-in pedals I I I'm

401
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,318
too scared to do that have you guys seen

402
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,198
those where your feet actually like

403
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:53,078
attached to the pedal and there's like a

404
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,919
trick to get your foot out that's not

405
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,679
for me what other kinds of bike riding

406
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,799
might be the next level my little

407
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:00,799
brother

408
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,958
used yeah the jumps and the ramps and

409
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,318
and then you know the the guys that do

410
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:08,318
the racing and such anybody here do like

411
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:10,519
BMX racing or the the mountain biking or

412
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:12,278
the the like the tour to France sorts of

413
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,679
stuff

414
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:15,399
racing so but yeah so there is a level

415
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:18,638
and

416
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,000
so um this next one I found this video

417
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,000
by a kid named Spencer and so I want you

418
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,679
to look at some of the stuff that

419
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,360
Spencer can do and think about how he

420
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,359
got to that

421
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:35,649
point

422
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:35,650
[Music]

423
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:44,589
[Music]

424
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:50,389
[Music]

425
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:59,919
and so any we have any Spencers in here

426
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,879
no I you know I I think as a kid i'

427
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,719
probably in accidentally did some of

428
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:05,199
those moves you know flipping off or

429
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,480
doing some of stuff I'm I always look

430
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,959
back at my I've got two brothers and it

431
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,599
it's amazing that none of us have brain

432
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,679
damage considering the stuff that we did

433
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,599
as kids so but how do you think Spencer

434
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,919
got to the point where he's at do you

435
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,558
think it just happened

436
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,319
overnight no he had a lot of practice do

437
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:24,199
you think every one of his flips he

438
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:25,558
worked perfect the first time no he

439
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,439
probably had a lot of bumps a lot of

440
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:29,440
bruises and he you know he' tried to do

441
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,200
a flip and he'd land on his head or his

442
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,360
butt or his back or whatever and he

443
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,120
figur out okay what do I need to do

444
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,879
different he kept practicing so he was

445
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,399
working through and and trying to learn

446
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,720
each time he tried something so now I

447
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:46,400
propose that one more

448
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:50,880
step in our bicycle

449
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,038
Academy I know it's hard see I was

450
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,080
helping what do you

451
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,200
say can I help you a little bit you need

452
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:00,839
to use your legs you got to push with

453
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,840
your leg

454
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:06,599
so obviously that's where we started so

455
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,399
why are we back at that point now why

456
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,439
why are we back at that stage are we is

457
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,038
it kind of we're going to be old and

458
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,720
have to get back on a tricycle one

459
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:16,038
day yeah how how to teach someone so now

460
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,519
when we're back at that stage we're not

461
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:20,839
the little guy with the helmet on the on

462
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:23,679
the tricycle we're the parent behind the

463
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:26,000
tricycle um trying to teach our child to

464
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,519
do that and so what I've tried to

465
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,279
demonstrate with those videos and and

466
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,960
getting you guys to think back to your

467
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,079
own experiences say I was trying to

468
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,079
connect to your experiences with riding

469
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:37,599
a bike to think about how you went

470
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:39,038
through that process and it was you know

471
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,079
if we went all the way to where Spencer

472
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,359
is I mean that might be a 10 or 12 year

473
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,879
development cycle in terms of of bike

474
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,599
riding and so learning is a process that

475
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:52,400
we go through that we might call the

476
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:54,599
Learning Cycle and I wish I could have a

477
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,080
good way to demonstrate this

478
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,399
three-dimensionally the best way I can

479
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,759
describe it is a slinky you guys know

480
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,280
what a slinky looks like and so think of

481
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:06,400
this as as a slinky with with multiple

482
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:08,639
revolutions and so we you know somewhere

483
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,640
in in our being we've had a very initial

484
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,919
focus with the concept and we'll stick

485
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,600
with our bicycle example here so then we

486
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,480
we have an experience with that bicycle

487
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,480
you know we got that that first tricycle

488
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,319
we had to learn about balance and so you

489
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,120
know we leaned too far and we fell off

490
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:25,279
well down here in the reflection phase

491
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,000
we think about what can I do differently

492
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,519
what does that mean why does this hurt

493
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,720
and we think okay well next time maybe I

494
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,720
should shouldn't lean quite so far and

495
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,360
we try it again and we keep going

496
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,720
through this cycle over and over and

497
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:37,918
over then we get that bike with

498
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,360
handlebar breakes and we hit the front

499
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,120
brake and we flip off and as we're

500
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,079
laying on the ground we reflect and say

501
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,319
dang that hurts what don't I want to do

502
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,960
again okay I won't hit the front break

503
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:51,279
and let me try that again so it's just a

504
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:55,038
constant ongoing process and so thinking

505
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:57,319
now to your own current uh and future uh

506
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,759
practices in in your own

507
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:02,038
teaching what can take away from about

508
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,240
the Learning Cycle relative to how you

509
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:05,400
create learning experiences for your

510
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,120
students what are some things you can

511
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,120
take away to help you with

512
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,919
that failure Lear okay so it's not

513
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:19,199
always going to go successful and and we

514
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:22,720
can learn from the unsuccessful attempts

515
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,720
at things okay good what

516
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,440
else yeah breaking it down into

517
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,038
steps yeah break it down into steps we

518
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,320
can to get to the final you get yeah

519
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:33,919
that's an excellent thing and sometimes

520
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,319
we forget that we all have advanced

521
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,559
degrees in our respective areas many

522
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,319
times the students that we're working

523
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:40,480
with especially the undergrads and even

524
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,960
some of the grad students they don't

525
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,960
have near the the frame of reference

526
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:50,079
that we do okay what

527
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:53,000
else Travis I me a note of remembering

528
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,480
the the pieces of the puzzle that we had

529
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,558
forgotten you know the little mistakes

530
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,200
we made in learning about Concepts or

531
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,879
that now as experts we just kind of

532
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,240
forget that we knew that we don't slow

533
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,440
down and teach that to

534
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,200
students they won't learn yep that's a

535
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,120
good point and I would contend and this

536
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,200
comes from my own personal experiences

537
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,399
and as well as in the work that I do at

538
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,360
the University of Florida I get the

539
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,080
opportunity to do a lot of pure

540
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,759
observation of other faculty all over

541
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,399
the college and so one of my

542
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,440
observations is that as faculty and as

543
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,880
instructors we can get to be pretty good

544
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,600
at providing a lot of creative

545
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,720
experiences for our students I mean we

546
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,240
can come up with lots of cool

547
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,038
experiences for them and we invest a lot

548
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,200
of effort up here but we probably don't

549
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:41,200
place near enough emphasis down here so

550
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,600
we might create a very cool uh

551
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,480
experience in the greenhouse where the

552
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,599
students are are are growing out a crop

553
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,400
of of whatever and we'll talk to them

554
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,439
about that but then we don't help them

555
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,240
reflect and generalize based on that

556
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,080
experience we just jump right to the

557
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,759
next experience and so some of your

558
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:58,798
students are probably fairly

559
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:00,599
self-reflective and are themselves

560
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,918
hitting these steps but I would contend

561
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,079
that some of your students probably

562
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:05,799
they're just sticking up here they're

563
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,839
not really learning from it and they're

564
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,359
jumping to the next experience so you

565
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,000
know I would suggest that one thing you

566
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:14,079
can do is is intentionally design

567
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
activities to help your students reflect

568
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,319
about what you're doing figure out what

569
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,519
the next step is and work through the

570
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:24,439
learning cycle okay so principle two

571
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:26,759
learning is a cyclical

572
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,200
process principle number three learning

573
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:30,640
is about transforming the experiences

574
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,720
and so we talked a minute about creating

575
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,960
those experiences learning actually

576
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,200
happens about with the transformation of

577
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,200
those

578
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,599
experiences and so what I mean by this

579
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,600
is as as Educators one of our goals or

580
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:52,798
our goal is to help take things that

581
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:57,079
exist out here in the wide wide world

582
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:59,278
and help put them here in the brains of

583
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:00,960
our students now on my campus two today

584
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:02,319
I got to go into the psych the

585
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,038
psychology department actually saw a

586
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,879
bunch of human brains in jars which was

587
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:07,319
kind of interesting um but it's about

588
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,559
it's about transforming those

589
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,079
experiences and it's not as simple as

590
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:12,759
checking into a hospital and having a

591
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,079
surgical procedure where they you know

592
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:16,278
Stitch you open and dump it in and

593
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,558
Stitch it closed if they could do that

594
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:18,839
we'd be out of a job because they

595
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:20,558
wouldn't need us to help our students

596
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:22,759
learn but it's about

597
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:26,119
transforming those experiences for our

598
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:28,839
students now and this might sound like a

599
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:30,479
very simple question but I think it's an

600
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:32,119
important one as we think about what we

601
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,720
do as Educators and what we think about

602
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,599
as far as the the types of experiences

603
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,558
that we create but What mechanisms does

604
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:40,558
the human brain use to get

605
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,440
information how does our brain get

606
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:53,079
information our senses right our eyes

607
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,720
and nose and ears and and mouth and so

608
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:58,798
so so we our brain receives information

609
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,640
through sensory inputs from our five

610
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,319
senses and so as we are thinking about

611
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,799
creating experiences for our students to

612
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:08,200
transform we're really thinking about

613
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:12,240
creating opportunities for our students

614
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:14,240
to use their senses to grasp the the

615
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,759
information the concept that we want

616
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,839
them to do

617
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,200
now I'm not going to pass judgment on

618
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,639
Corell but I'll point right at the

619
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,679
University of Florida I travel around

620
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,520
and look in many of our College

621
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,080
classrooms and which two senses do you

622
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:32,079
think that we probably over

623
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:34,558
use in the way that we teach them at

624
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,558
least on our

625
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,919
campus eyes and ears eyes and ears and

626
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,278
sometimes it's not even the eye

627
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,360
sometimes it's a lecture with no

628
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,599
illustration but it's eyes and ears and

629
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,359
so we we really rely on the eyes and the

630
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,918
ears and you know that for some Concepts

631
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:51,839
that's not a bad way to go about it but

632
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,038
I would contend that there are probably

633
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,918
plenty of opportunities where we might

634
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:58,558
think about taste and smell and touch

635
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,080
and what can we do to provide a more

636
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,200
sensory Rich experience um for our

637
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,359
students I mean some of the stuff that

638
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,399
you guys do with the fruits and the

639
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,918
vegetables and stuff I mean shoot let

640
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:08,599
them taste it let them touch it let them

641
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,799
do whatever they smell it whatever they

642
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:12,879
need to do to really get that and it's

643
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,960
about as the information is traveling

644
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,880
into our brain the more ways and the

645
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,240
more modalities that we can get it in

646
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,080
there the deeper it's going to be

647
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,759
embedded and the the learning is going

648
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:26,158
to be even stronger so schematically

649
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,759
what might that look like this is a

650
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,200
model of of cognition called the

651
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:33,398
information processing model and this

652
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,278
was uh has some parallels to the way a

653
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,000
computer works it's actually in in

654
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,440
educational psychology during the time

655
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,558
when they were developing this model it

656
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,240
was in the early ages of the the

657
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,200
computer age and so they drew some

658
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,480
parallels from it but to me it makes

659
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,640
pretty decent sense about um how that

660
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,558
works and so we have some sort of an

661
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,240
input through our

662
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:55,519
senses through our senses transformed

663
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,599
into working memory or short-term memory

664
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,158
and then stored into long-term memory

665
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,199
and then when we need use it it's pulled

666
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,039
back into into working memory okay so

667
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,880
that intuitively makes sense probably to

668
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:07,839
to most of you but I want to put a

669
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,399
couple other layers on that relative to

670
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,959
the things we've been talking about so

671
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:14,158
if we think about this in terms of where

672
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,519
these things are

673
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:20,399
happening I would contend that these

674
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,440
things are happening outside of the

675
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:24,759
person so we're providing these

676
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,240
experiences so on a daily basis in your

677
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,359
classes when you create learning

678
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,000
activities for your students you're your

679
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:33,158
creating these sensory input

680
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,038
opportunities for the students okay this

681
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:38,200
half is what's happening inside up here

682
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,079
this is the part we can see pretty

683
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,319
easily this is the part that we hope

684
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:44,119
that it's happening and when students

685
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,439
are getting it we think we see evidence

686
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:49,079
that this is happening but but not

687
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,320
always then to put it one more layer on

688
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:54,359
it if we think about our learning cycle

689
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:55,639
model that we just saw this is providing

690
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:57,558
the

691
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,080
experience this is providing the

692
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:02,599
reflection and generalization and so I

693
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,839
would contend that if we only focus on

694
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:06,359
this

695
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,079
part this part may or may not be

696
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,240
happening as well as we would like and

697
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,839
so I think it's important to to Really

698
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,480
complete that cycle to where we're

699
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,599
providing opportunities for the students

700
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,159
to to Really internalize that at a

701
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,158
cognitive

702
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,240
level so our principle number three was

703
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,599
that learning is about transforming

704
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,919
experiences and so thinking the few

705
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:31,158
things that we just talked about what

706
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,038
are some things that you might think

707
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:37,760
about well I can do this different in my

708
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,759
classes that might make a difference few

709
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:48,200
ideas I going to ask a question

710
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:51,278
what the reflection and generalization I

711
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,919
I we I have a lot of experiences but to

712
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,000
get students to stop and reflect and

713
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,200
generalize what have you seen to work is

714
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,798
that the question you're asked us what's

715
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,919
worked effectiv well yeah what's worked

716
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,918
effectively for you why I'm

717
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:07,439
here I know you I know you well enough

718
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,120
to know that journaling is used quite a

719
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,440
lot and students you say okay we're

720
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,918
going to do a little bit of a a

721
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,000
journaling class students like I do that

722
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,360
all the time in all my other class it

723
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,960
might be journaling it might just be

724
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:20,199
some discussion it might just be some

725
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,558
thought-provoking questions I just

726
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,159
wanted to

727
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:29,359
comment last fall she the thing care

728
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:31,720
Share exercise and then I and Marvin as

729
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:32,879
part of you I was student that we were

730
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,399
asked to teach

731
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,360
at class and I used things share and I

732
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,038
it helped to communicate the topic that

733
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,079
we were discussing and trying to teach

734
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:46,000
the class so I think it was good because

735
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:48,839
it was a short like sound bite and stud

736
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,599
took the information in and then

737
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:52,278
projected it back out and got an

738
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,879
opportunity to learn from each other

739
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:57,000
yeah good you had a different one I was

740
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,159
going to say um have them teach it have

741
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,440
them teach it yeah so anything to really

742
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,960
just pause for a few minutes and have

743
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,200
the students do something that forces

744
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,960
them to think about it whether it's a

745
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,480
think pair share there's a little

746
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,880
activity called a minute paper where

747
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,519
they just exactly 60 seconds they write

748
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,399
down what they just learned or U you

749
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,159
know anything to get them discuss with

750
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:21,119
with a a colleague

751
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:24,559
journaling um anything just to pause and

752
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:27,199
so you know if if you are accustomed to

753
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,678
lecturing for 50 minutes straight if you

754
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,679
want to make an immediate change one

755
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,240
thing might be lecture for 10 minutes

756
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,880
then do a quick little activity to get

757
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,919
them allow them to think lecture for

758
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,480
another 10 minutes then give them a

759
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,880
little activity to think about what

760
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,319
you've done just to to break it up a

761
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,960
little bit um and so one of the things

762
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:46,278
that we really want to do and suggest is

763
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,679
that Implement Variety in what you do

764
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:50,480
and so you know you might like think

765
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,200
pair share and it might make sense to

766
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,798
you but that doesn't mean it's going to

767
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,640
make sense to all your students and so

768
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:57,599
you want to have Implement some variety

769
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,840
in what you do so that your students can

770
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,839
you can reach a greater number of

771
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:03,398
students yeah um I had an internship

772
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:06,639
over the summer and like what we did

773
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:07,959
ucal um you had end of the day note you

774
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,038
pretty much recap everything that you

775
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,319
learn during the day and then at the end

776
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:13,440
of you work with like say your

777
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:15,439
supervisor and you talk about like what

778
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,640
you learned and that was like a great

779
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,880
way to tie everything together because

780
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,320
you get so caught up in everything and

781
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,240
it's just really good to go back and

782
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,639
like see what you actually learned yeah

783
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,159
yeah that's a good

784
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,559
thing generalizing you're reflecting

785
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,960
that's kind of a good yep yep that

786
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:31,558
that's an not yeah so there there's no

787
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,759
magic bullet um just you know whatever

788
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:34,839
figure out what's going to work for you

789
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:36,398
and your situation your students and and

790
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:37,918
occasionally pause and let your students

791
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,278
actually think about what it is that

792
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,080
you're doing okay so we'll move

793
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:45,119
on principle four learning is about

794
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:46,798
building connections learning is about

795
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,959
building

796
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:51,158
connections and so I want to introduce a

797
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,880
a term to you called brain

798
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:56,000
plasticity um and it it's the the cool

799
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,799
thing about learning is that learning

800
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,880
actually causes a physical change

801
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,440
in the human brain and so if we think

802
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,320
about what we do as

803
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,798
Educators we we think about imparting

804
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:10,200
knowledge to our students helping them

805
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:12,200
learn things we are actually hopefully

806
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,000
causing some physical changes in the

807
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,080
human brain and so that was a pretty P

808
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,319
when I first learned that it was a

809
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:19,000
pretty powerful thing to me as an

810
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,918
educator to think about you know the the

811
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,038
efforts that I'm making even though I

812
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:26,320
may not be able to see them is causing a

813
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:28,558
physical change in uh in the human brain

814
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,798
now if we were

815
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,038
wanted to be at a scientific level and

816
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,720
you want to inject a bunch of dye in

817
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:36,558
somebody's brain and put it under a very

818
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,278
powerful microscope you could see it

819
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,119
it's about uh building and breaking

820
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:41,558
brain synapses and those are the natural

821
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:43,959
electrical connections in the human

822
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:45,359
brain and so if you're interested in

823
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,278
this sort of stuff you can go Google it

824
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,359
and look it up in the in the biomedical

825
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:52,119
literature but it really causes a

826
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,638
physical change in the human

827
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:56,599
brain now some of you might be

828
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:58,038
comfortable at the microscopic level I'm

829
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:00,199
certainly not comfortable at the micros

830
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:02,200
opic level so I like to think at at more

831
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,919
the theoretical and what can I what can

832
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,120
I see and what can I do and so there's a

833
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:11,120
concept called cognitive schema that to

834
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:13,319
me makes a lot of sense in how to think

835
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:16,199
about how people learn if we think about

836
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:19,038
cognitive schema it it's I visualized it

837
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,319
as kind of a Web of Knowledge with each

838
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:24,278
one of these nodules being a discret

839
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,638
piece of information and so if we go

840
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:28,759
back to our bicycle riding example um

841
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:31,240
this one might be pedaling and this one

842
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:33,240
might be balance and this one might be

843
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,638
turning and this one might be handlebar

844
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,399
breakes and so forth so we've got this

845
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:41,000
existing Web of Knowledge now let me

846
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:44,239
pose a question to you thinking about a

847
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:48,240
novice versus an expert how do you think

848
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,240
these schema might

849
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,558
differ more interconnections with the

850
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,079
expert yeah so the expert is going to

851
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:58,278
have more connections between here and

852
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,119
the expert will probably also have more

853
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:01,919
nodules and so it'll be much more

854
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:04,558
connected and so you all in your

855
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,840
respective areas in probably have a very

856
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,398
welldeveloped cognitive schema around

857
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:10,678
whatever it is that that you do um I

858
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:12,678
would contend that your students when

859
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,200
they come to you probably have a very

860
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,720
skeletal one with either some missing

861
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,440
connections or maybe some connections

862
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,278
that are actually wrong and need to be

863
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,960
broken um and so the the challenge is

864
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:27,440
then so as an educator we present that

865
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,278
new piece of knowledge and we are very

866
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,320
good at this we can create a lecture we

867
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,960
can create an experiment we can create a

868
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,359
reading we can do this very well we can

869
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,919
give lots of new knowledge but what's

870
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,119
what's the problem with what we see

871
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,120
right

872
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,359
here it's not connected right it's not

873
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:46,440
connected and so this is where you guys

874
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:48,479
get very frustrated and I've been there

875
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,320
myself where you say dang it I taught

876
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,079
them that how come they can't figure

877
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,638
this out well it's because they have

878
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,319
this piece of knowledge they just never

879
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:57,918
made the connection that it fits out

880
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:01,158
here and so it's just laying out there

881
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,240
by itself and so if you ask them to give

882
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:04,519
you back that information in the exact

883
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,440
same way that you gave them that

884
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,880
information they can probably do that

885
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,760
but if you ask them to use that

886
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,240
information in a different way they're

887
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,520
like it doesn't make sense it's it's not

888
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,039
connected and so it's all about building

889
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,679
these connections and that comes back to

890
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:19,119
the notion of building those the the

891
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,320
opportunities for reflection and

892
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,320
generalization to help your students

893
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,599
figure out how does this new piece of

894
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,480
knowledge connect with with the existing

895
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:31,039
knowledge now the challenging thing is

896
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,079
you get that brand new class at the

897
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,719
beginning of the semester and you've got

898
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,320
30 students in it or whatever and so

899
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:40,279
they're in your class and each one of

900
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,679
your students has an existing cognitive

901
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,280
schema how many of those 30 students are

902
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,280
going to have the same cognitive

903
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:51,918
schema

904
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:54,599
zero zero now they might have some

905
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:57,159
shared experiences if you teach a senior

906
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,880
level course in the major and your

907
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:02,279
students taken pretty similar courses to

908
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,680
get to that point there's probably some

909
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,359
similarities in their schema but they're

910
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:08,440
never going to be the same the the

911
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:09,719
challenging part and also sometimes the

912
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,880
exciting part is teaching those

913
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:15,399
introductory classes when you don't have

914
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,838
a clue what they know um but they bring

915
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,320
in a lot of interesting experiences in

916
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:20,920
there so again it's all

917
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,599
about building connections and so that's

918
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,200
principle

919
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:27,960
four and I'm getting close on time

920
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,919
aren't I Neil you're doing good am I

921
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,838
okay 15 minutes left okay I want to save

922
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,880
a little bit of time for questions

923
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:38,880
so as we help the students process so we

924
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,358
give them that new that new piece of

925
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,599
information we introduce that New

926
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:44,440
Concept there there's really two general

927
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,519
ways that we can think about that new

928
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,760
piece of knowledge either the they're

929
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:51,199
going to assimilate it so if that New

930
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,160
Concept that new experience fits with

931
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,199
their existing schema they're going to

932
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:59,000
kind of say okay that makes sense it

933
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:01,679
fits or they might have to accommodate

934
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,079
that new experience if it's different or

935
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:07,118
if it's inconsistent or contradicts what

936
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,079
they already know and so they can

937
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,000
probably process these sorts of things a

938
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:12,480
little bit quicker than they can these

939
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,280
sorts of things and so it's all about

940
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,358
providing opportunities to to help your

941
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,519
students figure out how does this new

942
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:19,559
piece of information fit and that's

943
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,639
where that reflection and that

944
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:23,400
generalization can help kind of to tie

945
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:26,159
that loop back

946
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:29,079
around so that's principle four it's all

947
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:31,598
about building connection and so in your

948
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:34,280
own teaching what are some things that

949
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:38,200
you might be able to do to help your

950
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,200
students build those

951
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:56,759
connections okay yeah so give them

952
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,240
different opportunities to to kind of

953
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,000
experience that help build those

954
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,000
connections good what

955
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,480
else conceptual framework yeah it can

956
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,639
and it it's very nice if you can

957
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,599
organize your your course or whatever

958
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:16,279
around a broader conceptual framework

959
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,200
and keep tying back to that framework to

960
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,560
help the student see where it fits

961
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:23,519
because it might be crystal clear to you

962
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,318
that a plus b plus C equals D to

963
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,000
students it it may not be and so having

964
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:29,440
that larger graphic organizer will help

965
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,679
do that good I want to take a quick in

966
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,599
my when I teach my classes I say we'll

967
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:33,879
take a quick time out earlier that was

968
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:35,960
demonstrating weight time so when you

969
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,720
ask a question and you just wait until

970
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,000
it's awkwardly silent and then someone

971
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,919
is willing to give you an answer and so

972
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,318
when you ask a question don't feel

973
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,920
afraid to have the awkward silence

974
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:45,559
because sooner or later someone will

975
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,159
will give you a good answer so other

976
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:49,880
ideas about providing that helping

977
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:49,879
students make those

978
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:56,440
connections for me like teaching

979
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,400
chemistry if I'm teaching the sh Le's

980
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:02,280
principal in stress readjust to minimize

981
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:05,318
the stress I ask them in their personal

982
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,720
lives where have they been in stress and

983
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:09,800
what did they do they readjust so I I

984
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:10,919
tie it back to personal experience Ah

985
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,200
that's that's an excellent way so

986
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,519
connecting it with connecting a A New

987
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,318
Concept to a different kind of

988
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,719
experience that has some similarities to

989
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:23,199
it good good okay so principle

990
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:26,439
five teaching is about creating

991
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:28,318
meaningful learning

992
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,760
experiences

993
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:31,119
teaching is about creating meaningful

994
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,440
learning experience and we talked about

995
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,039
the Learning Cycle and we talked about

996
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,480
that we are are very good at creating

997
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,519
learning experiences and so I want to

998
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,079
throw a couple ideas out at you about

999
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:43,000
creating meaningful learning experiences

1000
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,560
things that are really going to engage

1001
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,039
your students and and drive things

1002
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:49,639
home the first thing I want to do is is

1003
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:52,000
talk to you about just a couple of

1004
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:53,598
differences between teaching and

1005
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,519
facilitation and sometimes we like to

1006
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,838
throw those words around a little bit

1007
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,039
but I would argue that most most of the

1008
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,799
time the meaningful learning experiences

1009
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:05,239
are happening when we are facilitating

1010
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,680
the learning process as opposed to

1011
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:10,159
teaching and so in teaching the teaching

1012
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,000
the teacher delivers the knowledge in

1013
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,358
facilitation the learner constructs the

1014
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,480
knowledge okay so a subtle

1015
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:17,559
difference teaching instruction is

1016
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,318
rigidly

1017
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:22,519
planned facilitation it's more flexible

1018
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:24,400
and spontaneous and we're open to those

1019
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:26,519
anomalies that happen that we weren't

1020
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,240
expecting in teaching the teacher has

1021
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,719
very strict control over the

1022
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,159
environment in facilitation the teacher

1023
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,118
and the learner share the control of the

1024
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:36,440
environment and teaching the Learners

1025
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,400
are

1026
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,519
passive in facilitation the Learners are

1027
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,160
active and so I would encourage you to

1028
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,318
think about your own teaching right now

1029
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:47,480
and figure out okay where do I where do

1030
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:49,079
I fit on this Continuum and and are

1031
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,358
there some things that you can change to

1032
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,720
maybe inch over this way now it's a

1033
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,159
little bit intimidating sometimes to to

1034
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:58,279
go into a class session and have a rough

1035
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,399
idea about what you think is going to

1036
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,160
happen in that class session but based

1037
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,318
on the interactions with the students it

1038
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,920
might go a slightly different direction

1039
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,719
than you were you were planning and so

1040
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,039
it's U you know it's it's tough

1041
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:11,919
sometimes as the instructor to give up a

1042
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:13,358
little bit of that of control to say

1043
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,480
okay we're going to we're in this

1044
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:16,400
together and I'm going to help

1045
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,318
facilitate this process but you're not

1046
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,559
getting off easy you got to contribute

1047
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:22,318
as well so I'd encourage you to think

1048
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:24,199
about that the other idea I want to

1049
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:25,480
present to you is called Dale's cone of

1050
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:29,078
experience how many of you have heard of

1051
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:31,079
Dale's cone okay so a couple and so

1052
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:32,519
Dale's con and this really it's actually

1053
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,280
pretty dated but it's a pretty it's a

1054
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,199
seminar work from from Edgar D and it

1055
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,880
comes out of the educational media

1056
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:39,480
literature but it's really about as we

1057
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,960
think about creating those experiences

1058
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,559
for our students we have choices to make

1059
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,079
in how we choose to present that

1060
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:49,719
everything from up here which is all

1061
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:52,359
symbolized which is very abstract to

1062
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:55,239
things that are down here which are very

1063
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:57,358
concrete and very direct and so an

1064
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:59,519
example might be if if we were going to

1065
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,799
teach uh how many of you teach some sort

1066
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:02,800
of plant identification okay so I

1067
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,680
figured in this department there' be a

1068
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,039
handful of you guys that teach those

1069
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,480
sort of courses and so as we're teaching

1070
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:09,880
those sorts of courses we can make some

1071
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,159
choices about how do we how how do we

1072
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,119
want to teach that well we might be up

1073
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,598
here and talk about what plants look

1074
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,960
like or we might be up here and show

1075
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,039
drawings about what plants look like we

1076
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,559
might show pictures of plants we might

1077
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:25,199
come down here but when possible and

1078
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:26,400
practical let them see the real thing

1079
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,279
and so I would encourage you to think

1080
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,079
about as you are teaching Concepts in

1081
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,920
your

1082
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,400
classes when it's possible and when it's

1083
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:40,318
practical to think about what can I do

1084
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,280
to provide direct personal interaction

1085
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:44,599
of the with the students with the

1086
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,440
concepts now

1087
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:48,400
logistically and sometimes it's just

1088
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,358
impractical to do those sorts of things

1089
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,039
but I would contend you know if if if

1090
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:53,759
you can let them see the real thing and

1091
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:57,039
do the real thing and touch the real

1092
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,560
thing then give them the real thing

1093
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,440
let's let's not come up here um so I

1094
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:04,400
would encourage you to think down there

1095
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,240
where we are really in the doing phase

1096
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,240
as opposed to the observing or the

1097
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:14,318
symbolizing next thing I want you to

1098
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,400
think about is what I call let's add

1099
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:20,480
some real world experiences to to what

1100
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,599
we do and so I would propose that in a

1101
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,440
class you might add some things like

1102
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,200
guest speakers I know you guys have have

1103
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,440
world class faculty here but let's hypo

1104
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:32,118
Hy uh hypothesize for a minute that

1105
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,200
maybe there is an expert that knows

1106
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:36,480
something better than someone here does

1107
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:37,558
why not invite that person in or Skype

1108
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,280
that person and that's the beautiful

1109
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,160
thing now with technology is is you can

1110
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,359
bring

1111
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:48,719
anybody you can bring anybody into into

1112
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,358
the classroom pretty easy field trips

1113
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,838
again it's about going to see the real

1114
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:55,679
thing um get your students involved in

1115
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:57,318
in research uh do service learning

1116
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,358
projects do outdoor adventure learning

1117
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:00,199
sorts of things where you're getting the

1118
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:02,960
students some direct purposeful

1119
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:05,239
experience with those things now

1120
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,800
activities outside of a course that are

1121
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:08,919
more at the program level might be

1122
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,240
things like internships study abroad

1123
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,280
experiences or broader research projects

1124
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,078
and um I don't know about on this campus

1125
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,599
but uh I suspect you guys are similar to

1126
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,519
us that we've got a lot of bright

1127
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,800
energetic students that are are begging

1128
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:26,480
for opportunities and on our campus we

1129
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,880
probably don't make good enough use of

1130
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,800
all these energetic bright young people

1131
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,240
in the other work that we do in in the

1132
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,960
research and extension activities that

1133
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,558
we do I would contend that there are

1134
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,280
probably some great opportunities um to

1135
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:43,240
get those students actively engaged in a

1136
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,480
variety of things so principal five

1137
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:46,759
was creating those meaningful learning

1138
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,920
experiences so now we're going to talk

1139
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,359
about let's take this home what can you

1140
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,720
do and so we're going to go back to

1141
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:57,759
another think pair share and so I want

1142
00:43:53,719 --> 00:44:00,959
to ask you guys two very specific very

1143
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,440
concrete things that you could take away

1144
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,880
from my discussion today to immediately

1145
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,039
at least in cases of the faculty

1146
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,358
immediately for the grad students at

1147
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:11,400
some point in the future two things that

1148
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:12,880
you can immediately take away to make an

1149
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,838
impact on your teaching so think about

1150
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,559
that for a sec and then pair up with

1151
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:19,119
with someone around you and share your

1152
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,920
ideas let's reconvene we'll get a few

1153
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,200
ideas shared and then we'll save a few

1154
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,599
minutes for

1155
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:27,318
questions and so let's let's hear a few

1156
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,640
examples and and Geneva I'll give you

1157
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:30,400
guys a heads up I'm going to call on you

1158
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:31,960
guys in just a minute so you guys can be

1159
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,639
thinking too but what are a few examples

1160
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,240
of things that uh that you could

1161
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,358
immediately Implement in your teaching

1162
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,279
for the faculty or for the grad students

1163
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:42,838
something that you could uh to do in the

1164
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,720
future so a few

1165
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:48,239
examples not lecture as much okay not

1166
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:48,239
lecture as

1167
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,240
mucha if you have a guest speaker

1168
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,358
providing some context so that they

1169
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,558
don't helping them draw that connection

1170
00:44:56,358 --> 00:45:00,078
why is person okay yeah help help your

1171
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:01,599
students draw the connections out of a

1172
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,039
guest speaker so it's not just this

1173
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,000
anomaly with this strange person was

1174
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,119
here for a day and now they're gone to

1175
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,880
have pull some meaning out of that good

1176
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,800
another example yeah after a fill trip

1177
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,519
the experimential learning

1178
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,039
part encourage students to yes yeah so

1179
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:19,639
after we've had that experience helped

1180
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:21,239
the students kind of draw some so it

1181
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:22,759
wasn't just a cool day outside the

1182
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:24,078
classroom it was actually there was some

1183
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,160
meaning ad it helped the students pull

1184
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,800
that out so Geneva what about you guys

1185
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,318
what's something that some of you guys

1186
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,318
might choose to

1187
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:36,960
implement I have a

1188
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:38,558
suggestion teaching a a co-taught course

1189
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,000
with you know three sections and

1190
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:44,480
different instructors sort of U struggle

1191
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,280
with the integration I think maybe at

1192
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,119
the beginning use the that schema as a

1193
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,400
way to show interactions within the

1194
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:54,039
components where we have different

1195
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,440
people talking about it doesn't always

1196
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:59,000
integrate as well as one person might

1197
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,200
great idea how about one more example

1198
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,199
from

1199
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:09,000
Geneva this is just like

1200
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:17,959
mik I guess I use a professional

1201
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,960
audience instead of a student audience

1202
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:23,440
okay passing around something physical

1203
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,559
for them to play with with their hands

1204
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,880
demonstrates the principle yeah that

1205
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,599
that's an ex you know you you know you

1206
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,119
you guys are going to have a lot of

1207
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,720
kinesthetic Learners and just having

1208
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,960
them of course the danger is sometimes

1209
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,239
that can be a distraction where they

1210
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,280
might be playing with it and not

1211
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:35,838
listening to you but at least they're

1212
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,359
they're getting some that any other

1213
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,000
examples in here or maybe we can shift

1214
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:42,799
over to questions yeah um take take your

1215
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,719
students outside on campus public school

1216
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,400
there yeah I mean the the the world is

1217
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,719
our campus and then particularly now

1218
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,559
with Technologies we can you know we can

1219
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:53,959
travel around the world in a very easy

1220
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:56,519
way where in the past it hasn't been

1221
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,079
quite so easy so I think we've got a few

1222
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:01,280
minutes for questions and so I'll take a

1223
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,880
few questions so in terms of that

1224
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,480
reflection oftentimes it's a lot

1225
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:09,039
morei you know set of questions to take

1226
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,318
home and read and write and respond and

1227
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,759
yeah how obviously that's probably

1228
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:16,239
better than nothing but how much better

1229
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,520
than nothing is it well it is assuming

1230
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:18,879
that the students actually do it it is

1231
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,039
better than nothing but there there's a

1232
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,440
concept now and I'm actually playing

1233
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:23,920
around with it in one of my undergrad

1234
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,079
classes it's called the flipped

1235
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,480
classroom have you guys heard of that

1236
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:29,920
terminology before it's the whole notion

1237
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,400
of of let's take the basic knowledge

1238
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,639
level stuff and do that as homework in

1239
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,800
the form of online lectures and readings

1240
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:38,920
and let's use class time then for the

1241
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,880
deeper discussions and the reflections

1242
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,159
on that and so you might think about you

1243
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,079
know are there some ways that I can do

1244
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,558
some things are there some things that I

1245
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,880
can take out of the face Toof face time

1246
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,359
to provide more opportunities for the

1247
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,559
face Toof face time because I mean let's

1248
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:54,880
face it I mean how many of you carry

1249
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,880
around something that looks like this

1250
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,039
most of you probably do and I hate to

1251
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,720
break it to you but everything that

1252
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:01,960
every one of us knows is available on

1253
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:03,919
this little device and so the the

1254
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,358
benefit our students get from us is not

1255
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,838
the knowledge they can get the knowledge

1256
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:09,318
anywhere they get the benefit of

1257
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:11,279
interacting with us so that we can think

1258
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:13,400
like a plant breeder or think like a

1259
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,559
weed scientist or think like an educator

1260
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,680
or think like a whatever you are think

1261
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:20,119
like so the students can learn and

1262
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,558
interact with us so that they can learn

1263
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:24,680
to think like whatever it is we want

1264
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:27,359
them to think like good yeah I'm think

1265
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:29,919
about that first video with the young

1266
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:33,679
mom saying very good very good very good

1267
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:36,079
and I think it's Carol D who um had some

1268
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:39,558
groundbreaking research that looked at

1269
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:41,640
the impact of all of this positive uh

1270
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:43,680
judgment essentially all of this praise

1271
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:47,440
you're so smart you're so beautiful

1272
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:51,078
you're so great is creating a generation

1273
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,639
of risk averse Learners who are really

1274
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:55,519
afraid to make mistakes and I think you

1275
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:58,358
know we're seeing an impact of that in

1276
00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:01,679
our classes what are some very concrete

1277
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:04,000
ways in which you have fostered um a

1278
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,000
healthy risk taking in your teaching

1279
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,719
yeah and so

1280
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,400
the that's a a little bit expertise but

1281
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:12,798
I can share some personal examples and

1282
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:16,960
it's it's about creating an environment

1283
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:19,280
where being unsuccessful is okay and

1284
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,280
it's about learning from those mistakes

1285
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,079
and and I teach classes on teaching

1286
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,480
methods and so I teach all day about how

1287
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,720
to teach and then conversely at the end

1288
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,920
of the semester I ask my students to

1289
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:29,679
evaluate my teaching so it's a little

1290
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,280
bit intimidating to talk about the

1291
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:33,078
entire semester about this is how you

1292
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,119
teach good oh by the way evaluate my

1293
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:39,240
teaching but I I will periodically throw

1294
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:41,798
myself out there and say okay I just did

1295
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:44,118
this activity let's critique it and so I

1296
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:46,440
I model the behavior that I hope that

1297
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:50,240
they can see and I also in the way that

1298
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:53,599
I evaluate student work um I tend to be

1299
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:56,239
very proactive in providing constructive

1300
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,280
feedback and I try not to be penalizing

1301
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:58,959
in the way

1302
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,798
that I provide that feedback that you

1303
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,880
know did you think about this what could

1304
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:04,960
you do to make it better and to provide

1305
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,200
some constructive feedback and and and I

1306
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,199
also try to provide very quick feedback

1307
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:10,598
to my students because if if we're

1308
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:13,358
teaching a course where the concepts

1309
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:15,119
build on each other and you T concept

1310
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,199
one and then tested it and then you're

1311
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,480
on concept before before you get

1312
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:20,838
feedback from concept one the students

1313
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,679
might have some misconceptions they

1314
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:25,639
don't even know that they have by the

1315
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:28,039
time that they get there um so that

1316
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,118
that's our students at at Florida are

1317
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:30,759
like that I mean they they've gotten

1318
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,240
Straight A's their entire life and so

1319
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,839
anything less than a straight A is

1320
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:38,118
failure to them even though they haven't

1321
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:41,838
earned a straight A

1322
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:45,000
yeah you talked about being more

1323
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:46,639
spontaneous sort of makes you a little

1324
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,358
bit more vulnerable and that's okay

1325
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:49,358
you're taking a

1326
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:57,239
risk so doesn't make you less smart

1327
00:50:53,679 --> 00:51:00,639
obviously so you might get

1328
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:04,118
respected in that situation see

1329
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:06,480
that yeah that's it's it's the the

1330
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:08,079
classroom comes a very fun and dynamic

1331
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,679
Place although it can be a little bit

1332
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,440
intimidating at times too because you

1333
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:12,440
don't know what's coming

1334
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,799
next yeah go

1335
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:21,000
ahead uh yes in terms of giving

1336
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:23,679
information uh students in many cases

1337
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,920
you can say give a relationship between

1338
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:31,118
two two factors in a uh table of numbers

1339
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,960
or in a graph at least personally I gain

1340
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:37,760
so much more and it sticks with me a lot

1341
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:40,798
better if it's a a graph form I can see

1342
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,720
the shape I can see the spacing between

1343
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:47,880
effects or whatever uh get me comments

1344
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:49,318
on that well and actually so and and for

1345
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,798
a lot of people that is the way that

1346
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:53,279
they like to receive information um I I

1347
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:55,679
would encourage you to think about in a

1348
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,480
given class of any size you're going to

1349
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,919
have different kinds of students in that

1350
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,358
class and and as instructors we tend to

1351
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,960
be most comfortable teaching the way

1352
00:52:02,358 --> 00:52:06,239
that we like to have been taught when we

1353
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:09,159
were students but to recognize that all

1354
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:10,959
of your students aren't exactly the same

1355
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:12,879
and so it's about presenting things with

1356
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,599
some variety in the way that you do that

1357
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,318
so that you present those those graphs

1358
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:17,798
and those charts and and that's going to

1359
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:19,318
reach those kinds of a student and then

1360
00:52:17,798 --> 00:52:21,480
you're going to you know deliver that

1361
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:22,759
that fabulous lecture that's very

1362
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,760
engaging and you're going to reach those

1363
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,559
kind of students and then you're going

1364
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,839
to do an activity that involves the

1365
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,760
students out in the greenhouse house or

1366
00:52:26,838 --> 00:52:28,920
whatever and you're going to engage

1367
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,160
those kind of students so it's really

1368
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,559
about providing that variety of

1369
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:36,798
different kinds of experiences um for

1370
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:38,839
the students um but I would uh I would

1371
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:40,559
look for opportunities and tying it back

1372
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:43,558
to when we talked about the sensory

1373
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:46,079
inputs look for opportunities to engage

1374
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:48,640
all five senses when practical and and

1375
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:51,480
when appropriate as opposed to to just

1376
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:56,000
the visual and auditory that we often

1377
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:58,159
do other question question yeah so we're

1378
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,318
being uced to the muks where you have

1379
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:04,118
10,000 students none of whom you can see

1380
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:06,000
um and from what I understand in now and

1381
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:09,240
the reflection and generalization part

1382
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,199
of the uh learning process is really

1383
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:12,959
done by small groups of students with

1384
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:15,439
each other so that's about the end of my

1385
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:19,119
knowledge right there but could you uh

1386
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,079
touch on how this process works in that

1387
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,079
giant

1388
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,760
setting shipped into the online

1389
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,440
environment it does create some

1390
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,280
different challenges and it also creates

1391
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,318
some opportunities and and um reflection

1392
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,280
does not have to be just in small groups

1393
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:34,880
it can be but you've got you're going to

1394
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,200
have some Learners that are very social

1395
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,400
in the way that they learn and and

1396
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:39,439
they're going to they're going to want

1397
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,519
to share with their peers but you're

1398
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,960
also going to have some Learners that

1399
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:45,519
are very introspective and like to think

1400
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,240
things through themselves and so just

1401
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:49,759
providing that pause time for them to be

1402
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,759
able to do that and so in an online

1403
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,000
environment it might be through uh some

1404
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,839
sort of a discussion board where you

1405
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,559
know maybe you're not forcing them to

1406
00:53:56,838 --> 00:54:00,318
respond to anybody else's thoughts

1407
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,200
you're just giving them an opportunity

1408
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:05,400
to put their own thoughts down or maybe

1409
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:07,679
it's a uh a a guided reflective

1410
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,599
reflective Journal where over the course

1411
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:12,039
of of the class they've got to do an

1412
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,240
entry once a day once a week once a

1413
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:16,440
however that is structured um and so

1414
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,519
it's it's you know there's as I said

1415
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:21,039
earlier there's not a Magic Bullet that

1416
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:23,838
is going to fit everybody which is is

1417
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:25,558
challenging um but it also can be can be

1418
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:26,920
fun because it gives us as the Educators

1419
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:29,200
the opportunity to try out some

1420
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,720
different things and to experiment a

1421
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,719
little bit and and one of the things

1422
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:34,879
that and I I try to model this in in my

1423
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:37,159
own professional life too is it's about

1424
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,960
not being satisfied with the status quo

1425
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:40,118
and it's about trying out new things I

1426
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,079
mentioned earlier I'm trying out the

1427
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:44,240
flipped classroom and this is the second

1428
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,559
semester now I've done that and I I went

1429
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,838
through the learning cycle myself the

1430
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:47,960
first semester and figured out some

1431
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:50,358
things that worked and some things that

1432
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,159
didn't work and so now I'll do that but

1433
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:53,318
uh you know I'm I'm tenured so it's a

1434
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:55,838
little bit easier for me to be a little

1435
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:57,960
bit more flexible and spontaneous the

1436
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,480
untenured faculty probably have to be a

1437
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,119
little bit more focused and a little bit

1438
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,240
more Norm reference yeah so are you

1439
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:08,318
saying the flip

1440
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:11,358
or FP what does it mean it means that

1441
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:14,400
you so the has been that the face Toof

1442
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:16,598
face time is the the instructor

1443
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,599
lecturing and giving information and

1444
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:20,519
then the students then outside of class

1445
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,960
time take that information and apply it

1446
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:24,838
through some sort of a problem set

1447
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:28,000
homework project Etc the flipped

1448
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:31,038
classroom does that 180 and so you

1449
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,920
create a way to deliver the lecture part

1450
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,960
outside a classroom perhaps through some

1451
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:38,119
online recorded lectures readings those

1452
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:41,519
sorts of things then you use the class

1453
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:44,039
time the face Toof face time for uh

1454
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:46,599
problem activities inquiry

1455
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:48,839
activities uh those sorts of things to

1456
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:50,440
where if we think about are you guys

1457
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:53,000
familiar with Bloom's taxonomy and and

1458
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,838
the levels of cognition so delivering

1459
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,920
the lecture part that's often times at

1460
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:59,000
lower levels of Bloom STX on

1461
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,240
the problem sets are at the upper levels

1462
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,760
of Bloom's taxonomy so we when they're

1463
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:05,598
with us under expert supervision we're

1464
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,720
doing a low level stuff we send them

1465
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,400
home by themselves to work on the upper

1466
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:12,159
level stuff they reach a problem where

1467
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,798
they're struggling and they're stuck and

1468
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:15,480
so the flip classroom you do that just

1469
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:17,838
180 to where they're doing the higher

1470
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,719
level stuff with you to where you're

1471
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:22,759
helping them work through issues and

1472
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:25,399
challenges and things um and so it's

1473
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:27,880
again it it uh it has not been a perfect

1474
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,318
switch for me I I'm knocking on wood

1475
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,519
that this second iteration will go a

1476
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:33,038
little bit smoother than the first

1477
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:34,400
iteration um but it's and it's a

1478
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:36,799
different model for the students because

1479
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,358
the students aren't used to that and so

1480
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:40,880
it takes a little bit of training on

1481
00:56:38,358 --> 00:56:43,719
their part to get them prepared for

1482
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,880
thats like to get them not less focused

1483
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:48,959
on grades yeah yeah you have to get them

1484
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,119
focused on actual learning as opposed to

1485
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,838
just getting the grade which that can be

1486
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:56,079
challenging on some of these

1487
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:57,558
students so are we how are we doing all

1488
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,760
right

1489
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:03,039
