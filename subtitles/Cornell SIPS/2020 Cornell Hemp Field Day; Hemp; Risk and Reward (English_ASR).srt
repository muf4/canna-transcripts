1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,798
good afternoon i'm mary ulrich with

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,599
quinoa cooperative extension in orange

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,240
county

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,839
i two am on the hemp team and i'm going

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,240
to address a little bit about risk and

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,280
reward because of course the question

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,079
this year is the reward of hemp the

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,358
potential for

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:22,159
profit balance out with the risk

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,320
because those two things should be in

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,480
direct proportion to one another but

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,039
they may not be

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,760
and so has hemp and all rainbows and

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,920
kittens or is it a little wild westy

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,600
i've seen a lot of wild westy out there

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,120
in the last couple of years

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,760
and so i'm going to address a couple of

18
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:43,199
ways to protect yourself

19
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,399
from the bad actors and other potential

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,840
negatives that

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,120
occur so how's risk measured and

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,760
mitigated you know we use

23
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,558
cost of production data john mentioned

24
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,960
that

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,640
it's coming along but the future market

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
certainly is questionable we certainly

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,359
do need more

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,159
of more interest from consumers to keep

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,159
that price up to keep the demand up

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,240
we also mitigate risk with crop

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,000
insurance i don't know what the payments

32
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,158
i haven't talked to anybody who

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,438
signed up for crop insurance and i mean

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,118
the usda

35
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,639
fsa crop insurance

36
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,400
so i don't know what those payments are

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,239
going to be for 2020.

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,600
my prediction last year was that they

39
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,239
were either going to be really good or

40
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,478
really bad

41
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,158
and so we'll see what happens with them

42
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,840
i'm always curious to talk to people

43
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,040
who've had insurance so if you've had

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,159
insurance please

45
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,920
give me a ring because private or the

46
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,400
federal government supported ones

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,799
that would be i'd love that information

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,079
so and also one way to protect yourself

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,360
or to

50
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,798
mitigate risk is to have a contract and

51
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,680
of course with the 2018

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,280
farm bill going to be brought into

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,680
effect in new york state

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,599
by the end of the year there's lots of

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,759
changes in the landscape happening and

56
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,000
of course we're not used to

57
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,079
legislation changing so quickly around

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,799
crops but the last few years this has

59
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,718
been

60
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,640
quite a little roller coaster so that in

61
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,679
itself is a risk that you don't know

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,238
where things are going to go

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,878
legislatively of course the big

64
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,680
force measure or the big risk is that

65
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,519
fda may decide to

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
regulate the crop particularly in the

67
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,400
case of cbd

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,480
and that could have a huge impact

69
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,800
on markets production if fda said no no

70
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,159
this

71
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,920
is a drug and everybody has to have

72
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,639
just like a drug everybody has to have

73
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:39,439
the same kind of testing and monitoring

74
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,878
then there would be a lot of producers

75
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,959
and processors

76
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,239
that would no longer have a market

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,519
because they couldn't meet those

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,200
requirements

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,480
and so the other thing i just want to

80
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,238
say about contracts you know if it

81
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,359
sounds too good to be

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,280
true it probably is and

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,480
i'm going to show you a flyer in a

84
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,959
minute that

85
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,439
can help you out in terms of contracts

86
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,959
so what's the biggest thing that i see

87
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:08,000
as a problem with uh hemp

88
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,400
contracts or hemp relationships right

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,039
now

90
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,000
is that there's no collective knowledge

91
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,000
you know we have for

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,239
produce we have the blue book so the

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,439
people can go look up buyers in new york

94
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,640
state

95
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,719
buyers are bonded so that if

96
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,479
a seller doesn't get paid they can go to

97
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,080
the state and get reimbursed through

98
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,158
that bonding process

99
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,599
if you know they really didn't get paid

100
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,798
for something that they sold and

101
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:35,359
everything was supposed to be okay and

102
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,200
the seller just didn't get their money

103
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,120
there's a way to get it back but in hemp

104
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,439
that doesn't exist right now

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,560
and there's no institutional memory

106
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,079
which we should have

107
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,878
or we have in other businesses you know

108
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,879
who is going to pay you you know who the

109
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,280
traditional bad actors are you know the

110
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,239
guys who pay in 30 60 90 and the ones

111
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,080
who don't

112
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,719
if you don't know your neighbors do and

113
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,879
so sharing information about that

114
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,799
in other crops has been very open and

115
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,639
hemp it has not been so even

116
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,159
what little institutional memory is

117
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,679
being gathered

118
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,039
it's not being shared and so it seems

119
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,840
like

120
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,598
bad actors are going from farm to farm

121
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,199
or from region to region

122
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,639
and causing trouble and certainly this

123
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,799
isn't just about cbd

124
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,160
i've had it happen that folks selling

125
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,439
grain came to me

126
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,360
because they didn't get paid for their

127
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,040
grain because the buyer said

128
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,040
that it was moldy but didn't tell it was

129
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,199
moldy until like three months later

130
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,840
so there's no way to trace back whose

131
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,120
fault that was it was just very

132
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,879
unfortunate and so also very unusual

133
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,759
relationships between

134
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,000
value and cost that the farmer needs to

135
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,479
buy

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,160
into the processing somehow which is

137
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,120
really you know not the case

138
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,800
ocean spray you know really doesn't need

139
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,360
the farmers necessarily

140
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,478
to buy into the processing part itself

141
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,800
they might be a co-op

142
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,839
in terms of selling but do they own the

143
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,840
equipment

144
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,439
maybe not or orange juice companies or

145
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,799
any of those

146
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,600
there isn't that same kind of need to be

147
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,120
involved

148
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,199
there's a lot of interest from people

149
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,160
who have never been involved in

150
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,079
agriculture

151
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,840
that can be a little bit of a problem

152
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,279
there's also what i call the billionaire

153
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,638
rule there's a lot of folks running

154
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,319
around saying oh i have billionaire

155
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,519
friends well unless you see a picture of

156
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,199
him with

157
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,680
warren buffett like on his christmas

158
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,919
card don't believe it

159
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,600
so uh one of the local growers actually

160
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,038
said if it's a good party it'll still be

161
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,800
going in a couple of years

162
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,319
and if it's a bad party i never wanted

163
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,919
to go in the first place

164
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,199
he said that one question about why he

165
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,519
was because he was going to grow and

166
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,840
then changed his mind in the last minute

167
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,159
and

168
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:47,758
19 and so just um using caution

169
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,280
so to try and um

170
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,240
look more closely at some of those

171
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:55,439
contract details there's this uh

172
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,280
six page pamphlet the first two pages

173
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,439
are about production stuff but then the

174
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,519
next four about contracts

175
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,879
i wrote it with the assistance of

176
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:08,079
several attorneys agricultural attorneys

177
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,759

178
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,519
on both the cornell website

179
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,840
and the hemp blog which here's the pages

180
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,758
and so the blog is on the left

181
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,159
that's what it looks like and so there's

182
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,759

183
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,039

184
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,080
