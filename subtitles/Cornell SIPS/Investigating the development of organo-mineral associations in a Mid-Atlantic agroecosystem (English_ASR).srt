1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,800
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:04,799
university

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,320
okay thank you for the introduction uh

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,000
yeah so today i'm pretty much gonna be

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,519
talking about the work i've been doing

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,800
soil chemistry related work

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,278
unfortunately i wasn't able to give a

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
fly fishing related presentation

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,640
if i wouldn't go over too well for the a

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,240
exam but

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,039
i'll be talking primarily about work

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,959
that

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,800
uh i've done a lot of it'll be

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,399
preliminary data but also some proposed

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,558
aspects of the overall project that i've

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,359
been working on past three or four years

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,359
in graduate school

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,320
so

19
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:41,679
i'm going to start off by giving a brief

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,359
overview of what i'm going to be talking

21
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,759
about

22
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,119
i'm going to provide a background on

23
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,280
soil organic carbon and dissolved

24
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,439
organic matter absorption and soils

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,480
these are going to be pretty quick

26
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,079
then i'm going to move on to the

27
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,078
research questions

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,239
questions that kind of motivate

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,399
the project

30
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,078
i'm going to follow that up with a more

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,920
detailed

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,560
explanation of the experiments and the

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,960
hypotheses as well as data

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,118
that go along with the project

35
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,599
which encompasses both field-based and

36
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,280
laboratory-based studies which look at

37
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,879
widely different scales field-based

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,280
studies are more focused on the profile

39
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,199
level and the lab-based experiments are

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,359
on the sub-nanometer

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
in some instances level

42
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,640
and i'm going to wrap up with some quick

43
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,280
acknowledgments and hopefully have time

44
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,920
to field some questions

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,519
so soil organic carbon

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,519
why do we care about it it is the

47
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,039
largest terrestrial organic carbon pool

48
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,000
on the planet

49
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,799
this

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,118
estimate here on this figure is seven

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,960
seventeen hundred and fifty gigatons

52
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,560
which is fairly accurate uh but well

53
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,919
shouldn't it accurate but it's a fairly

54
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,759
accepted value

55
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,439
uh and that's big it's bigger than the

56
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,959
atmosphere and biomass carbon pools

57
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,719
combined

58
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,798
and the reason it's so large is because

59
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,359
the carbon in these soil pools is

60
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,280
considered relatively stable uh it once

61
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,640
it's there it likes to remain there and

62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,118
the carbon there can have really long

63
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,439
residence times that can exceed 1000 or

64
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,479
so years

65
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,799
uh

66
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,400
the reason it's so stable

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,840
primarily is because there are some

68
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,640
mechanisms that are at play in soils

69
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,000
keep the carbon stabilized and

70
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,919
two big mechanisms are binding to

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,919
minerals and occlusion of the material

72
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,919
so it's not accessible to be broken down

73
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,879
a lot of the material gets in the soils

74
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,959
particularly in the subsoils through dom

75
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,039
dissolved organic matter

76
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,800
this is a major input of soil carbon

77
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,799
throughout soil profiles

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,920
and this is the fraction of soil organic

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,160
matter that is

80
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,759
in soil solution and is hence very

81
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,598
mobile on soils

82
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,039
so when soil solution percolates from

83
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,799
the surface

84
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,639
dissolved organic matter goes along with

85
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
it and the material is sequentially

86
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,598
adsorbed and locked up in organomineral

87
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,920
associations as the soil solution

88
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,318
percolates

89
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,039
the actual absorption process is pretty

90
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,518
complex as dom itself is not all the

91
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,519
components will absorb equally and it's

92
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,158
influenced by dom properties such as

93
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,158
molecular size the dom and the amount

94
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,958
and the properties of dom that

95
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,359
have an effect on the actual absorption

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,039
to soils they're sensitive to a lot of

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,360
different factors and one that we

98
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,479
understand fairly well is that land use

99
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,720
has a pretty profound impact on dom

100
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,479
and a real big one that we know of

101
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,400
and is actually relatively common is the

102
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,679
practice of tillage it is a land use

103
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,680
practice that has

104
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,680
a pretty profound impact on dom

105
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
character

106
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,200
but much of what we know is restrict to

107
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,719
the plow layer and what we know

108
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,639
is that tillage

109
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,120
tends to make dissolved organic matter a

110
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,719
little more humified and that is rich in

111
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,519
aromatic and carboxylic type

112
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,519
functionalities

113
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,039
so the molecular

114
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,640
structure and character of dom

115
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,079
how it actually translates to dom

116
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,119
absorption

117
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,599
is

118
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,920
not entirely known for a fact but there

119
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,759
is a model that has been presented in

120
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,798
the literature about seven years ago by

121
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,959
marcus claber and associates

122
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,040
investigating the way organic matter

123
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,639
tends to absorb and assemble at mineral

124
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,879
surfaces

125
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,800
and it's based on some observations that

126
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,959
there's a really strong adsorption of

127
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,639
proteins and other high molecular weight

128
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,120
amphiphilic molecules

129
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,519
and amphiphiles just going back a quick

130
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,360
refresher in chemistry are molecules

131
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,560
that possess both polar and nonpolar

132
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,479
moieties or functionalities

133
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,639
and these tend to absorb very strongly

134
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,360
directly at the mineral particle surface

135
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,960
where they kind of rearrange and form a

136
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,879
base for further organic matter

137
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,719
adsorption

138
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,360
and

139
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,840
dissolved organic matter

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
also absorbs not only preferentially

141
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,279
through these components but it forms

142
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,800
patchy multi layers on mineral surfaces

143
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,758
which ultimately results in a

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,759
hydrophobic type

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,000
hydrophobic um surface once the dom is

146
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,400
actually absorbed and this is believed

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,079
to be the result of

148
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,079
i should say that was inferred to uh

149
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,360
be a additional layers of organic matter

150
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,879
absorbing

151
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
so all these observations were kind of

152
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,560
taken together again and used to develop

153
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,679
this contemporary model that is

154
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,680
typically pretty well accepted

155
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,399
but there are some flaws with this model

156
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,520
it's primarily based on bulk type

157
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,519
observations and we're not really sure

158
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,719
how it actually proposes

159
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,079
how it actually translates to the

160
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,440
molecular assembly uh the model infers

161
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,199
molecular assembly but it isn't really

162
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,759
based on any direct observation of those

163
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,520
films and this is

164
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,199
i forgot to change that that's not

165
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,198
offset to suggest anything

166
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,478
and a lot of the measurements that

167
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,360
we use

168
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,839
to

169
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,360
a lot of measurements that were

170
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,679
formed the basis of that model were um

171
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,280
based on single soils where they have

172
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,720
dissolved organic matter absorption to

173
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,119
single soils

174
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,280
and these kind of measurements dominate

175
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,639
not only the the model's basis but also

176
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,519
much of what we know about dissolved

177
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,879
organic matter absorption in general

178
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,599
and these soils aren't necessarily

179
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,199
coupled as a soil profile would be

180
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,879
so we don't really know a whole lot

181
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,800
about the actual sequential

182
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,038
fractionation and adsorption of

183
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,038
dissolved organic matter through a soil

184
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,719
profile

185
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,719
and additionally

186
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,400
we're not really too sure what happens

187
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,240
when you modify

188
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,560
the soil organic matter and dom in the

189
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,680
top surface and its properties how that

190
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,879
translates to adsorption

191
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,160
both in

192
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,319
surface soils and the subsoil

193
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,599
so this kind of brings me around

194
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,479
to more specifically some of the

195
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,478
research questions

196
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,160
first one

197
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,719
how does preferential retention

198
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,720
absorption of dom translate to soil

199
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,680
organic matter on soil particles

200
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,680
throughout the profile

201
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,478
so

202
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,959
when

203
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,680
dom percolates and it

204
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,279
preferentially and sequentially absorbs

205
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,280
what ultimately is going to be retained

206
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,679
on soils and what will ultimately not be

207
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,679
retained

208
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,879
and the second research question if we

209
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,038
have a process at the surface like

210
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,240
tillage that is altering the dom

211
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,240
character

212
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,840
that is making it changing its chemical

213
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,478
structure or chemical size

214
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,399
how does this translate beyond the

215
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,079
surface if there is preferential

216
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,478
absorption

217
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,719
how does it influence dom mobility into

218
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,800
subsoils where it might be retained into

219
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,280
a stable organomineral association or

220
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,280
something like that

221
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,400
um

222
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,560
next questions i have two more research

223
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,959
questions are a little more

224
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,720
molecular level oriented and they kind

225
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:13,239
of are a little more focused at the

226
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,240
model itself that was presented

227
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,759
how does the actual process of

228
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,240
preferential absorption

229
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,240
play out

230
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,840
we have dissolved organic matter that

231
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,240
preferentially absorbs the mineral

232
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,399
surfaces and we can see this by looking

233
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,918
at single samples but we don't know what

234
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,679
the actual process looks like the

235
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,038
absorption process

236
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
isn't a single point so if we're

237
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,479
analyzing a single sample

238
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,240
we're missing out on some pretty

239
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,440
important details

240
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,799
such as

241
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,839
are we actually

242
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,679
seeing

243
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,600
a strong absorption of infraphiles

244
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,958
directly at the interface followed by a

245
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,800
subsequent reorientation or not

246
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,559
is it possible there are other dom

247
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,159
components that aren't rich in protein

248
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,079
or amphiphilic type components that are

249
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,559
absorbing first

250
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,399
these are some things that

251
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,399
we don't presently know all that well

252
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,319
and the last research question

253
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:12,799
how do these adsorb dom films actually

254
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,800
assemble at the molecular level again

255
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,559
the model is based on larger scale

256
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,759
measurements and if you have a

257
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,119
measurement

258
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,278
in scope that exceeds the actual size of

259
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
the film you really end up missing out

260
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,838
on the actual structure you cannot

261
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,200
structurally structurally resolve

262
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,440
the angstrom and small nanometer scale

263
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,360
features of these films so for example

264
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,120
if you're looking at this

265
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,800
entire film and you're taking a

266
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,440
measurement that exceeds it

267
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,879
in in scale

268
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,480
you might be able to measure it and say

269
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:48,399
okay this film is composed of four

270
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,680
orange spheres four green and four red

271
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,958
on the other hand you could do the same

272
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,278
thing with this film and come to the

273
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,599
same conclusion and clearly the assembly

274
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,600
of these two films is not the same

275
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,959
and this is something that

276
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,959
we were pretty interested in looking at

277
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,160
so i'm gonna get in now and talk a

278
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,000
little bit about the actual experiments

279
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,600
we have set up i'm going to start off

280
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,039
with the field based experiments which

281
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,800
are more oriented towards research

282
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,360
questions one and two that look at soil

283
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,359
profiles

284
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,480
so the field sites i've been using are

285
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,479
located in central pennsylvania kind of

286
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,240
down near penn state

287
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,920
it's down at the russell e larsen

288
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,879
agricultural research center in rock

289
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,879
springs pennsylvania

290
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,440
it's smack dab in the middle of the

291
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,879
state and nice and

292
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,120
nestled in between the ridge and valley

293
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,679
province down there

294
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,039
and the plots we're using

295
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,479
are part of a

296
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,519
longer tillage experiment that was

297
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,959
initiated back in 1978

298
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,639
and there are three overall treatments

299
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,799
that were used there was a chisel

300
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,399
disking a moldboard disking and a

301
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,479
no-till treatments

302
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,559
we decided to use the moldboard disking

303
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,839
and the no-till plots

304
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,879
because the moldboard disking is

305
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,480
probably a little more rigorous and

306
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,200
might play out in a more interesting way

307
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,039
and

308
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,839
these plots that are till they're tilled

309
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,799
annually in the spring

310
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,240
and

311
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,919
all of these plots

312
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,759
are

313
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,319
planted using a soybean oat and corn

314
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,319
rotation

315
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,879
and these plots uh the soil that's

316
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,399
underneath them is

317
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,360
what is known as the hagerstown soil

318
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,839
series

319
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,839
which is

320
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,519
an alpha cell developed over a limestone

321
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,839
residual

322
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,959
and it results in

323
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,640
a silt loam topsoil and a silty clay

324
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,838
subsoil

325
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,360
pretty smooth in

326
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,399
horizontal and the mineralogy of these

327
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,240
soils

328
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,600
is dominated by

329
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,000
iron oxides and illite primarily

330
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,720
and it's not quite so easy to make out

331
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,240
here but the cores on the left represent

332
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,440
a tilde plot and the ones on the right

333
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,440
represent a no-till plot

334
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,639
so within these plots

335
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,639
that we have laid out

336
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,360
both the tilde and the no-till plots we

337
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,600
have

338
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,879
sets of five lysimeters

339
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,879
and they're each set

340
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,078
actually each lysimeter is placed at a

341
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:22,159
different depth

342
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:24,399
we have lysometers placed at 72 50 35 20

343
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,600
and 12 centimeters depth and this was

344
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,039
controlled primarily by

345
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,639
the actual um

346
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,199
if we were to go too much deeper we'd

347
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,000
start hitting bedrock in some places at

348
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,200
least

349
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,200
so we had to be limited there

350
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,599
so with these lysimeters

351
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
we're going to collect the soil solution

352
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
and we're going to analyze it in a few

353
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,078
different ways

354
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,240
we're going to determine the amount of

355
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,278
carbon and nitrogen in solution

356
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,039
we're going to look at the dissolved

357
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,480
organic matter this is the organic

358
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,240
matter that has not preferentially

359
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,879
associated the soils it remains in the

360
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,079
dissolved organic matter fraction

361
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,919
and we're going to look at the relative

362
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,919
molecular composition using a technique

363
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,599
known as ftir

364
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,719
it it's used to

365
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,278
speciate

366
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,320
molecular functional groups

367
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,200
such as

368
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,560
aromatic or amide type groups

369
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,040
and we're also going to use a technique

370
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,199
known as hp sec

371
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,039
high performance size exclusion

372
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,959
chromatography to look at the relative

373
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,278
molecular size of the dom that is not

374
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:28,559
associated as this too

375
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:32,838
is a factor in preferential absorption

376
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,838
of dissolved organic matter to soils

377
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,879
so we're also going to collect and

378
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,519
analyze the material that is actually on

379
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,519
the soils

380
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:45,359
and we're going to

381
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,519
collect them from the same depths

382
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,639
at the lysometers we're at

383
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,560
we're gonna

384
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,519
but the cores be fractioned about into

385
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,518
five different sections

386
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,839
we analyze them thus far

387
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,278
for organic carbon and nitrogen

388
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,040
we also have the relative molecular

389
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,559
composition of the organic matter and we

390
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,559
will be at some point determining the

391
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,879
fractional surface coverage

392
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,399
so it's believed that adsorbs to form

393
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,759
patches on mineral surfaces it'll be

394
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,198
interesting to see

395
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,559
how these

396
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,719
structures actually develop throughout

397
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,719
the profile

398
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,879
so for question one we were more focused

399
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,399
on just in general

400
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,480
how does this partitioning play out

401
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,000
throughout the soil profile

402
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,920
i think some general trends are going to

403
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
be observed

404
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,479
first and foremost i think the material

405
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,120
that

406
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,039
is on the soils which is organic matter

407
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,039
that has over the years preferentially

408
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,399
associated with the soils is going to be

409
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,198
heavily enriched

410
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,360
in amide type groups

411
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,479
aromatic type groups and carboxylic type

412
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,120
groups and this is going to be

413
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,839
throughout the profile

414
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,198
there are there's ample evidence both

415
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,480
from laboratory and field-based

416
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,479
experiments in the literature that

417
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,560
suggests these groups absorb very

418
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,360
strongly to soils so i believe these are

419
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,119
going to be prevalent throughout

420
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,399
near the surface i think it's possible

421
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,159
we might actually be able to detect some

422
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:15,360
aliphatic and carbohydrate type carbon

423
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,958
that's only going to be present near

424
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,639
near the surface where we have thicker

425
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,559
films and perhaps

426
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,720
multi-layer type associations that will

427
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,078
be observed

428
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,240
in the dissolved organic matter the

429
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,479
material that will not be selectively

430
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,240
associating with the soils i believe is

431
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,399
going to be primarily enriched in

432
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,440
carboxylic type groups

433
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,120
and

434
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,040
we might see a little bit of aliphatic

435
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,320
type contribution

436
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,319
representative of smaller acids

437
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,079
so for question two

438
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,680
and this was the question again that was

439
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,198
focused

440
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,198
on looking at the difference between

441
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,120
tillage and no-till basically

442
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,198
investigating the impact of tillage

443
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,759
on the preferential association process

444
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,599
throughout the profile

445
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,680
we're going to be doing a comparison a

446
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,800
relative comparison between the till and

447
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,638
the no-till soils

448
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,639
and again i think in general these soils

449
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,720
are going to follow the trends mentioned

450
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,159
on a previous page but between the two i

451
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,160
think there will be some differences

452
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,919
that will be observed for example i

453
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,439
think the no-till soil will have a

454
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,159
relatively higher

455
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,839
aliphatic and carbohydrate type content

456
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,799
as the material won't be

457
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,480
as humidified or as broken down

458
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,719
in this in the surface soil at the very

459
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,720
least

460
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,000
throughout the profile i

461
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,680
think especially once we get into the

462
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,360
subsoils

463
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,559
we're going to go back to seeing a real

464
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,839
rich presence of aromatic carboxylic and

465
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,838
amide type functionalities

466
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,599
as for the dissolved organic matter in

467
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,560
these soils

468
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,159
i think

469
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,518
the primary functional groups that are

470
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,240
going to be present again are going to

471
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,240
be carboxylic type groups

472
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,680
but the no-till soil i believe is going

473
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,839
to have

474
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,758
somewhat of an enrichment of aliphatic

475
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,679
type structures relative to the tilled

476
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,160
soil which again is going to be more

477
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,880
humidified more broken down

478
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,199
more enriched in

479
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,520
in in more recalcitrant type functional

480
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,519
groups

481
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,119
so i've mentioned what we

482
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,359
plan on doing or have done to some

483
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,958
extent and the hypotheses so i'm going

484
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,318
to kind of show you guys a little bit of

485
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,199
the preliminary data we have from these

486
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:29,199
experiments so far

487
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,440
the organic carbon content of the tilled

488
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,400
soil and this is just one of the tilled

489
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,400
soils that is a

490
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,359
from the satellite simmeters that was uh

491
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,798
in the middle of the moldboard till plot

492
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,119
there's no real surprises with the

493
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,558
organic carbon content

494
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,239
within the plow layer we have a pretty

495
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,200
uniform distribution and below that

496
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,200
point it drops off

497
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,519
on the right there's a we have a carbon

498
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,120
zane spectrum

499
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,240
which kind of provides some insight as

500
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,839
to the actual

501
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,240
character of the organic matter that is

502
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,079
associated with the soils

503
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,519
and it's kind of interesting in this

504
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,678
case because you look within the plow

505
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,960
layer where your organic carbon contents

506
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,480
are

507
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,919
pretty much the same you do see some

508
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,038
differences in the spectra like there's

509
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,520
this little broad shoulder here

510
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,558
but throughout the profile and generally

511
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,839
speaking

512
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:21,839
what you observe

513
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,159
is a relative decrease of amide and

514
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,079
carboxylic type carbon

515
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,759
with depth

516
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,839
relative to aromatic carbon which is

517
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,879
seen to increase with depth

518
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,959
and this is pretty interesting

519
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,160
and a similar type trend is observed

520
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,160
with the no-till soils

521
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,759
at least with respect to the

522
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,959
distribution of the functionalities

523
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,038
it doesn't seem to be quite as

524
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,919
pronounced as it is in the tilled plots

525
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,319
but

526
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,720
you do see with depth the relative

527
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:56,079
intensity of these amide and carboxylate

528
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,919
type peaks here

529
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:02,079
with respect to these aromatic type

530
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,080
groups does change with depth

531
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,679
and organic carbon content is again

532
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,880
probably not much of a surprise to

533
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,679
anybody here

534
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,440
it's a lot higher at the surface

535
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,960
and then also undergoes a kind of

536
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,400
gradual decrease

537
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,319
but you can tell there's no real

538
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,320
homogenization there of the topsoil

539
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,558
so

540
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,919
i quickly showed you guys some of what

541
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,678
we know about the material that's

542
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,759
actually on the soils the organic matter

543
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,919
that is associated with the soils

544
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,440
i also took a little bit of dom from the

545
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,200
lysimeters and characterized it with

546
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
ftir

547
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,840
and these spectra are pretty interesting

548
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
uh

549
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:41,199
one thing i kind of want to get out of

550
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,640
the way first is that this peak here

551
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,080
at first i'm like oh it's great you know

552
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,759
i didn't think i was going to find much

553
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,798
organic material in this

554
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,079
solution

555
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:52,000
i saw that peak and i was fantastic

556
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,599
but then i noticed it looked shockingly

557
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,038
similar to a nitrate standard i had

558
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,558
prepared as well

559
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,119
so

560
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,639
and that's nitrate is obviously not dom

561
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,479
so that's kind of presented a bit of an

562
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,000
issue and i went and and

563
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,200
actually checked the concentrations and

564
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,880
there's a fair amount of nitrate in

565
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,798
these soils

566
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,120
but the good news is i also took a uv

567
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,798
vis spectrum of these soils which is

568
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,959
kind of used as a broad

569
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,359
is dom there is not their kind of

570
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,679
analysis and it is there

571
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,279
it has these characteristic shoulders

572
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,960
and

573
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,720
little like foot slopes there that are

574
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,840
indicative of dom

575
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,440
so

576
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,158
in addition to those

577
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,519
pretty stark nitrate peaks

578
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,360
we can discern a couple other features

579
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,599
primarily the presence of

580
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,079
carboxylate functionalities both the

581
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,439
symmetric and asymmetric groups

582
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,079
as well as

583
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,600
some presence of co and cc stretches

584
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,839
which you'll find in

585
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,918
aliphatic or carbohydrate type

586
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,240
functionalities

587
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,559
and again these appear to be somewhat

588
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,240
slightly more pronounced and enriched in

589
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,440
the no-till soil

590
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,200
but

591
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,400
it's hard to really say at this point

592
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,400
this is just from one set of data

593
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,919
so the conclusions from the field

594
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,240
experiments thus far

595
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,480
som character is not evenly distributed

596
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,599
throughout the profile

597
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,839
and this is again material that was

598
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,798
preferentially

599
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,798
retained and we're starting to kind of

600
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,279
get an idea of what's going on below the

601
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,798
plow layer in tilled systems and i'm not

602
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,319
talking about just the concentration of

603
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,359
the carbon but

604
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,359
starting to get a molecular

605
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,038
viewpoint of what the actual organic

606
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,798
matter on the soils looks like

607
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,798
not necessarily the

608
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:35,839
assembly of the the structure at this

609
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:37,279
point but

610
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,119
in general what it looks like and that's

611
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,639
that's a step forward

612
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,959
and there's still a lot of work yet to

613
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,960
be done

614
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,839
we need to go out and determine the

615
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,280
organic matter coverage of these soils

616
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,000
spend a little more time with those zane

617
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,599
spectra that i showed

618
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,038
of the organic matter characterization

619
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,879
on the soil

620
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,960
maybe try to make a little more sense of

621
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,400
them

622
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,919
it's also pretty critical at this point

623
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,679
to actually continue collecting and

624
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,360
analyzing soil solution and do it

625
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,360
seasonally because this is a pretty

626
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,519
dynamic fraction and it's

627
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,279
going to be important to make sure

628
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,720
if we see any differences or anything

629
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,839
interesting it's not simply the result

630
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,839
of a seasonal transition

631
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,439
it would also be nice to finally get

632
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,359
around to characterizing the size of the

633
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,000
organic matter in the dom now that we

634
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,000
know it's actually there

635
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,000
okay so that was the the field

636
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,960
part of my research and the general

637
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,480
project

638
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,319
uh now i'm going to talk a little bit

639
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,798
about the laboratory experiments we've

640
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,798
been running

641
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,360
so

642
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,798
we're going to we've used and are going

643
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,119
to continue to use a series of

644
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,879
spectroscopic type experiments

645
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,399
that will allow us to actually directly

646
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,720
probe the interaction of dissolved

647
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,960
organic matter as well as desi

648
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,440
model organic matter with soil minerals

649
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,120
on a really small scale

650
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,400
two techniques in general are going to

651
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,239
be used here

652
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,240
one of which is known as

653
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,558
attenuated total reflectance fourier

654
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,440
transform infrared spectroscopy

655
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:05,038
uh

656
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,960
for the sake of brevity i'm going to

657
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:10,798
call atr ftir from here on out

658
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,360
as well as x-ray photoelectron

659
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,558
spectroscopy or xps

660
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,000
and this will allow us to get in there

661
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,440
and really resolve some fine scale

662
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,240
structures

663
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,679
and

664
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,599
you know something on the order of a

665
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,960
couple angstroms to a nanometer to is

666
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,079
very much in play here and this is

667
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,079
what's exciting about this

668
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,519
so i mentioned we're going to be using

669
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,000
some dom models and these are going to

670
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:32,000
be useful

671
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,519
because they allow for a better

672
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,119
mechanistic understanding of what's

673
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,798
actually happening it's not as complex

674
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,319
as dom

675
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:42,319
so it's a little easier to discern

676
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,439
what's happening when you use model type

677
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,399
compounds that you can fully

678
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,558
characterize and understand

679
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,080
so we elected to use bovine serum

680
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:51,440
albumin

681
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,240
and dna

682
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,159
these are both biopolymers

683
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,159
and they're found not necessarily

684
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,000
themselves in soil like for example

685
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,280
you're not going to find bsa in soil but

686
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,240
you will find globular proteins

687
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,879
in soil and the general structure of bsa

688
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,000
and all proteins is pretty similar you

689
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,360
have a

690
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,119
a backbone

691
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,879
composed of amino acid groups that are

692
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,199
polymerized and you will get some

693
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,400
changes in side chain structure

694
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,960
as well

695
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,880
but these orient themselves in secondary

696
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,600
and tertiary type arrangements to give

697
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,600
what you see there

698
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,080
and this is a good model because there

699
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,840
are globular proteins in soil solution

700
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,000
and bsa itself is so very well

701
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,639
characterized so it we already know a

702
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,759
lot about it

703
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,559
dna

704
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:44,798
dna is found in soil solution it's

705
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,798
exuded by uh soil organisms and

706
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,159
is therefore readily available to react

707
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,879
with soil uh soil minerals as a part of

708
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,720
the deon fraction

709
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,159
and it like bsa is a biopolymer

710
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,120
only in this case

711
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,278
the main

712
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,639
backbone type structure is a pentose

713
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:06,720
sugar

714
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,720
that's connected via phosphate groups

715
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,519
and in the middle uh there are

716
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,278
nucleobases that are kind of used to

717
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,839
kind of glue the helices together to

718
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,839
form dna

719
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,399
so we also use model minerals in these

720
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,679
experiments they unfortunately aren't

721
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,679
very

722
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,600
compatible with whole soils that's one

723
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,759
of the drawbacks

724
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,719
the model minerals we elected to use are

725
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,558
ferryhydrate and montmorillonite

726
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,360
both very different but also both very

727
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,558
reactive towards organic matter so

728
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,119
it should hopefully give us a pretty

729
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,519
good idea of what's going on

730
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,839
with two different distinct minerals

731
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,759
ferryhydrate is a short-range ordered

732
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:46,798
poorly crystalline iron hydroxide type

733
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,679
mineral

734
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,639
and

735
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:54,159
its surface is composed of

736
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,278
hydrophilic ph dependent surface sites

737
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,320
as far as the charge is concerned

738
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,558
and the crystal lights that we

739
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,759
synthesized are pretty small they have a

740
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,278
real nice

741
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:04,319
high reactive surface area and they're

742
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,079
small

743
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,798
they're about 10 nanometers in size this

744
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:11,038
is an afm image of them so it shows that

745
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,200
general topography of the film of

746
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,720
ferryhydrate

747
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,000
montmorillonite on the other hand is a

748
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,000
crystalline two to one aluminosilicate

749
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,558
which also has ph dependent charge on

750
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,519
the hydrophilic edge sites

751
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:29,119
and the the structure itself also has a

752
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:31,278
ph independent charge that is situated i

753
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,239
believe on the siloxane sheet or perhaps

754
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,919
in

755
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,440
octahedral sheet in montmorillonite

756
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,840
so they're two very distinct minerals

757
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
we're going to use

758
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,278
so the one technique i mentioned

759
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,679
previously was atr ftir

760
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,119
and this is a suitable technique for

761
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,159
what we're looking to do

762
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:55,678
because it's highly surface sensitive

763
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,520
and it uses infrared radiation which is

764
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,880
very informative when you're talking

765
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,639
about

766
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,960
molecular level mechanistics it probes

767
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,880
molecular vibrations

768
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,120
so when you combine its surface

769
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,559
sensitivity with the information it

770
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,839
provides is a pretty useful technique

771
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,839
and it pretty much works by just

772
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,879
reflecting an infrared beam

773
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,038
off of a

774
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,559
diamond element which we have upstairs

775
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,720
in the lab

776
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,678
and when it's reflected it creates a

777
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,000
sampling wave that penetrates the sample

778
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,600
on the order of about a half to one

779
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,200
micron so

780
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,959
what that allows you to do is just look

781
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,720
at adsorbed molecules and not get as

782
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,720
much of a contribution from the solution

783
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,720
phase

784
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,278
so these experiments

785
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,559
again focused at the last two questions

786
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:47,440
that look at dom absorption process

787
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,798
as well as film assembly

788
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,960
are going to be run in situ so we're

789
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:53,119
going to deposit a mineral film on this

790
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,640
reflective element that i just mentioned

791
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,639
and as the material adsorbs with time

792
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,600
as it's drawn in like for example we

793
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,360
expose the film to a dom solution at

794
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,199
time zero

795
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,038
and as the adsorption progresses

796
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,159
material is drawn onto the film and it

797
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,679
absorbs and changes structures

798
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,039
until it reaches

799
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,038
what we're going to basically call an

800
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,558
apparent equilibrium

801
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,960
and at this point we can kind of

802
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,240
characterize the film

803
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,159
and then compare

804
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,640
material that's absorbed at all time

805
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,480
points to the whole dom and actually

806
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,000
look at the fractional

807
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,000
and preferential association of dom

808
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,399
so the other technique we're going to

809
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,559
take a look at is going to be

810
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,038
xps

811
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:41,038
and this is

812
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,918
surface sensitive like

813
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,000
in the same sense that atr ftir is it's

814
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,000
not going to get the whole bulk sample

815
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,880
but it's complementary

816
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,200
atr ftir will likely characterize the

817
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,120
entire dom film

818
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,399
this is only going to get the surface

819
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,839
maybe five to ten nanometers or so

820
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,398
and what this is going to tell us about

821
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:06,558
that surface five to ten nanometers

822
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:09,359
is

823
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,519
what's going on on the atomic level so

824
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,959
this is a an elementary specific

825
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,599
technique so it probes elemental

826
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,038
transitions

827
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,319
and these are they're going to be

828
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:23,919
sensitive to adsorbate structure so if

829
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:25,678
something adsorbs to let's say this

830
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,038
model mineral film

831
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,519
we should be able to detect the

832
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:29,519
structures

833
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,440
as the reaction progresses

834
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,599
and in addition to giving adsorbate

835
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,880
structure it can also be used to look at

836
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:43,678
the actual thickness of the xps films

837
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,200
oh excuse me the dom films as well as

838
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,200
the fractional surface coverage

839
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,119
so these experiments are going to look

840
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,960
like this we're going to expose a model

841
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,558
mineral film be it fairy hydrate or

842
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,240
montmorillonite

843
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,200
to a dom solution

844
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,120
we're going to take samples at a fixed

845
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,919
set of time points we have to work out

846
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,278
yet and analyze them with xps

847
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,960
and what this is going to do is let us

848
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:10,558
look at the surface most layer only

849
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,360
at each time point

850
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,440
and this will be very handy

851
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,000
especially when coupled with atr it'll

852
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,159
let us know not only the the bulk type

853
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,759
structures but also what the top of the

854
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,960
film looks like which would be useful in

855
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,440
resolving

856
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,440
assembly

857
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,360
so here's my hypotheses about what we're

858
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,960
going to see here

859
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:34,158
for question three how do i think the

860
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,600
actual preferential adsorption

861
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,799
throughout the whole process is going to

862
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,398
occur

863
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,798
i think that early on in the absorption

864
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,678
process with the models we're going to

865
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,079
see

866
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,480
approximate amounts of dna and bsa being

867
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,158
adsorbed to the minerals

868
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,240
i think once absorption is finally

869
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,320
complete though

870
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,519
bsa will ultimately be

871
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,119
preferred

872
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,359
i'll go and do this a little bit more in

873
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,959
the next slide

874
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,639
with the dissolved organic matter the

875
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,720
real

876
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,480
more complex solution

877
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,000
i think we can

878
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,440
kind of at least i've pretty much

879
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,480
assumed that initially we're going to

880
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,320
have a

881
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,919
real rich presence of aromatic and

882
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,079
carboxylic

883
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,759
type dom

884
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:17,519
and once the absorption process is

885
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,960
actually complete

886
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,918
this is still going to be the dominant

887
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,759
feature

888
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,159
but it will also be complemented by some

889
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,158
aliphatic or carbohydrate type dlm

890
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,240
so what do i think the assembly is

891
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,079
actually going to look like

892
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,200
i think that bsa

893
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,639
both on fairy hydrate and

894
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,480
montmorillonite

895
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,880
is going to form pretty uniform

896
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,640
multi-layers as it's been pretty well

897
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,960
documented in literature that bsa will

898
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,600
do

899
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,480
this um dna i think is going to form

900
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,678
patchy monolayer associations primarily

901
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,519
through binding of the backbone

902
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,200
phosphates with edge sites on

903
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,120
montmorillonite or directly on ferry

904
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,200
hydrate

905
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:02,639
and when both are present i think we're

906
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,919
going to have patchy type associations

907
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,919
of varying thickness

908
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,000
pretty much

909
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,000
where bsa absorbs first i think you're

910
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,319
going to continue to see a buildup of

911
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,960
bsa as the absorption progresses but

912
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,639
where dna absorbs first i think that's

913
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,480
going to be it i think

914
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,240
the remaining negative charge on the dna

915
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,480
will cancel out further adsorption

916
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,038
and for dom i think there is going to be

917
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,440
a uniform multi-layered

918
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,398
distribution on both soil minerals

919
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,200
with a base formed up of aromatic and

920
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,398
carboxylic rich dom

921
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,798
that

922
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:44,239
alpha and carbohydrate type

923
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,918
organic matter will then adsorb onto as

924
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,880
as

925
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,038
once the film was complete i should say

926
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,880
so now i'm going to quickly get into

927
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:55,038
some preliminary results here from the

928
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,200
laboratory based experiments

929
00:32:55,038 --> 00:33:00,960
this is bsa again the globular protein

930
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,399
when we expose this to a fairy hydride

931
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,679
film we saw some pretty interesting

932
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,558
things

933
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,000
uh so bsa by itself in solution is this

934
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,480
black curve here

935
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
and you can see it's got amide one two

936
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,919
and three bands

937
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,079
in the spectrum

938
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,159
and these are basically in reference to

939
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,678
bsa structures pre-elementary structures

940
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,440
on the bsa

941
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,440
but upon adsorption

942
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,278
which is this red curve you see here

943
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,558
after five hours it had pretty much

944
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:28,558
reached equilibrium by then

945
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,640
you see

946
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,159
some side chain vibrations pop up

947
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,240
but we're definitely most interested in

948
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,399
the amid one band as this represents

949
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,240
some pretty key structural vibrations

950
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:43,278
and this is typically used to look at

951
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,798
protein conformational change

952
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,960
so when we take a closer look at the

953
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:50,480
amid one band

954
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,480
we see some pretty interesting features

955
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:55,759
the band itself is composed of

956
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,759
three different components one of which

957
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,558
is assigned to beta sheets which is a

958
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,759
type of secondary structure

959
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:03,599
one is

960
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,960
composed of uh or

961
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:09,039
contributed to by beta sheets and turns

962
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,838
and alpha helices and random structure

963
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,159
so

964
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,679
these are all secondary type structures

965
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,159
and we can see

966
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,599
that in solution we have this

967
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,599
distribution

968
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,480
and once

969
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:25,280
the bsa absorbs we end up with a

970
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,639
different distribution we saw

971
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,159
some pretty substantial changes

972
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,280
throughout the absorption process and

973
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,039
this suggests that there is some

974
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,040
conformational change of the protein

975
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,200
and the conclusion from the infrared

976
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:40,319
data that you see up here was pretty

977
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,398
much reinforced by the xps data

978
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,480
the black curve you see on the bottom

979
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,918
is bsa the standard we were using and

980
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,719
the red curve

981
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:52,319
uh represents the

982
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:54,959
bsa that is absorbed onto fd oxide

983
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,159
and the spectrum shows the c1s amide

984
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,519
transition

985
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,838
well i thought the spectrum the spectrum

986
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:01,119
in general shows the c1s transition of

987
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:02,880
bsa

988
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,119
but you can see there's a change in

989
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,358
increase in this peak here

990
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,358
which is uh the amide contribution to

991
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:11,119
the spectrum

992
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:14,400
and this again suggests that something's

993
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,960
going on throughout this absorption

994
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,119
dna on the other hand uh

995
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,000
there are no amide bands so what we look

996
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,358
at

997
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,719
structurally

998
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:24,960
uh

999
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,719
it's typically considered

1000
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,639
what we typically look at when you look

1001
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:29,598
at dna structure

1002
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,279
especially

1003
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,800
talking about absorption

1004
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,640
is you look at the the backbone

1005
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,519
phosphates to see if they play a role in

1006
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:40,719
this case it looks like they do

1007
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,639
again the aqueous phase spectrum of dna

1008
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:45,279
and this is ftir so it's looking at

1009
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,358
vibrations is in black

1010
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,160
and once it is absorbed onto iron oxide

1011
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:51,759
for about five hours or so it's

1012
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:52,960
you see the spectrum that popped out in

1013
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,359
red

1014
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,760
and there is a big shift

1015
00:35:55,358 --> 00:36:00,239
in both anti-symmetric and symmetric

1016
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,800
phosphate vibrations

1017
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,799
upon adsorption

1018
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,440
and this insinuates that there is

1019
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,839
perhaps a direct binding of the dna

1020
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,358
backbone to the fairy hydride surface

1021
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,480
possibly through a hydroxyl type

1022
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,480
replacement mechanism

1023
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,759
and this is also reinforced by xps again

1024
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,358
if you look at our dna standard that's

1025
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,880
down here in black

1026
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,799
and the

1027
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,480
phosphorus transition

1028
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,160
of

1029
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,320
the absorbed dna

1030
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,799
you can see there's a

1031
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,000
shift in energy it's an increased shift

1032
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,680
it's hard to really make a whole lot of

1033
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,199
sense out of this at this point but that

1034
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,279
is indicative of some kind of a chemical

1035
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:42,159
change occurring to phosphorus because

1036
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,480
this is an elementally specific spectrum

1037
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,480
for p

1038
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,799
so the mixed systems we combined the two

1039
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,358
like i mentioned we were going to do

1040
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,359
previously

1041
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,880
and

1042
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,118
the solution again is here in black you

1043
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,519
can see features from both biomolecules

1044
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,119
in the solution spectrum

1045
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,960
upon adsorption

1046
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,960
some things clearly happen

1047
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,440
it's hard to say exactly what because

1048
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:12,960
there are some overlapping bands

1049
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,760
and this is where the xps data really

1050
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,920
became really helpful

1051
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,000
because it's difficult to discern a lot

1052
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,079
of structural information from that but

1053
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,920
the xps data kind of shed some light on

1054
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,160
on the structures

1055
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,159
and this is the c1s so this is the the

1056
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,358
carbon spectrum of the one to one

1057
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,358
material

1058
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:33,199
and you can see down here in blue

1059
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,239
is adsorbed dna

1060
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,838
and up here in red is adsorbed bsa so

1061
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,078
those are the individual components and

1062
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,358
when you combine them

1063
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,359
and you look at the adsorbed film from

1064
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,920
the one to one experiment you can see

1065
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,279
that amide one bump is appearing again

1066
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,960
so it kind of looks like bsa is

1067
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,400
reorienting even in mixed systems

1068
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,800
but it also looks like phosphorus might

1069
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,200
be as well

1070
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,599
this top peak here is the phosphorus of

1071
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,679
dna absorbed by itself

1072
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,760
the bottom peak in black here

1073
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,559
is the dna standard

1074
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,240
and in the middle this green peak is the

1075
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,759
the phosphorus spectrum from the

1076
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:11,919
combined system

1077
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,560
and you can see there is a slight shift

1078
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,039
as in dna absorbed by itself

1079
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,960
of the phosphate the phosphorus peak

1080
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:21,199
so

1081
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,920
both of these spectra kind of show that

1082
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,199
there

1083
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,320
there is still some structural

1084
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:25,519
alteration

1085
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,119
and likely

1086
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,639
direct coordination

1087
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,640
or association of both at the interface

1088
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,680
another thing these xps analyses yielded

1089
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:39,039
which i thought was pretty cool

1090
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,440
uh

1091
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,920
was the the actual ratio of the

1092
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,800
biomolecules that were absorbed using

1093
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,720
the p

1094
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,200
signal we can see how much it was

1095
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:49,199
diluted

1096
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:52,559
in in the one to one where there are

1097
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,559
both biomolecules

1098
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:55,838
and we did that and quickly looked at it

1099
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,480
and saw that there was a relative

1100
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:01,358
proportion of sixty percent bsa and

1101
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,358
forty dna absorb kind of suggesting that

1102
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:05,519
both were

1103
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:09,440
neither one was severely out competing

1104
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,440
the other which is kind of surprising

1105
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,599
so the whole dom experiments

1106
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,280
uh this is dom i extracted from a

1107
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,680
no-till surface soil using a water

1108
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,920
extract i passed it over a ferry hydrite

1109
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,519
film for the course of 12 hours

1110
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,838
and kind of

1111
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,599
what i'd expected in the hypotheses we

1112
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:28,559
saw a pretty nice enrichment of

1113
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,880
carboxylate type groups compared to

1114
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,639
the whole dom

1115
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,559
i should probably go back the whole dom

1116
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,199
is here in red and this is the dom that

1117
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,279
has not been fractionated by absorption

1118
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,759
and as material absorbs it becomes

1119
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,839
increasingly rich and carboxylate type

1120
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,119
groups relative to carbohydrate groups

1121
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:47,920
which is kind of the opposite of what

1122
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,119
you might

1123
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,039
see in the whole dom which is richer

1124
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,640
totally speaking

1125
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,440
in aliphatic and carbohydrate type

1126
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,879
vibrations

1127
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,320
so some conclusions from the lab

1128
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,800
experiments

1129
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,559
the preliminary data they reveal some

1130
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,960
new perspectives on organomineral

1131
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:09,119
associations and soil organic matter as

1132
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,880
a whole

1133
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,400
a new approach to dom adsorption has

1134
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,240
been developed

1135
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,599
kind of looking at the process in situ

1136
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,799
and then monitoring it with xps

1137
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,400
separately is

1138
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,880
pretty new and i think it's going to

1139
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,480
yield some good results in the end

1140
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,480
and the mixed systems to show only a

1141
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,960
small preference for amphiphiles which

1142
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,639
is in pretty direct contrast to what you

1143
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,800
might find in the literature

1144
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,879
and in particular uh

1145
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,519
the foundation of this claver model that

1146
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,800
i mentioned earlier

1147
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,480
and there's also still a lot of work

1148
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,000
that needs to be done

1149
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,199
i need to run some more absorption

1150
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,039
experiments

1151
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,799
perhaps try using dom from lysimeters

1152
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,559
which is a little more gentle perhaps

1153
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,839
more relevant rather than shaking it out

1154
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:53,039
in a lab and beating a dom out of the

1155
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:55,119
soil and there are a few other things

1156
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,039
that need to get done too

1157
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,960
sorry to run short i wanted to have some

1158
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,800
time for some questions though quickly i

1159
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,318
want to wrap up

1160
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,560
i'd like to acknowledge my lab group
