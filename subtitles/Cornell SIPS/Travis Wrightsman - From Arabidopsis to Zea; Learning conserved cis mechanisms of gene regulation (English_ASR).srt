1
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:13,798
University and so yeah it is a real

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,198
pleasure to introduce Travis ritesman

4
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:20,278
for his defense um he was born and

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,640
raised in LA and so uh he and my wife

6
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:23,359
have always connected over being

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,320
Southern Californians and things like

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,599
that and

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,719
so uh but he did his uh Bachelors at UC

10
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:35,159
Riverside and and um in Biochemistry uh

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,800
got started in understanding in his

12
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,558
world of understanding bioinformatics

13
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,718
and genomics uh working with Sue wesler

14
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,439
uh who uh was

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,280
a incredibly important figure in all

16
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,079
everybody in maage genetics today but he

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,280
worked with her to start really

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,840
annotating transposable elements in the

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,480
Citrus genome and I think really started

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,320
forming his ideas on how bioinformatics

21
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,718
should be done how it should be shared

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,079
with the community and everything um he

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,560
then applied to Cornell got in here we

24
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,599
were excited to have him but he also got

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,560
a full bright all at the same time and

26
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,280
so he said Ed I don't want to start here

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,840
I'm GNA go to Germany so he went to

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,799
Germany for a year and worked with that

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,478
left viagel group and there he helped

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,479
develop a pipeline of automated assembly

31
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,319
and annotation of a rabbit office genome

32
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:26,319
that was really important for

33
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,679
understanding the strength and

34
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,319
weaknesses of graphs uh at the time um

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,360
he then joined us in

36
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,879
2018 um and he's going to be telling you

37
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:39,200
about his research there but as part of

38
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,158
that he also took some time off to work

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,759
with Google X and he's wearing his

40
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,799
Google X t-shirt today uh but I think

41
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,478
you know you'll see the there's a very

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,399
strong streak in uh Travis of both

43
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:53,319
public sector commitment but also want

44
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,799
to understand how industry has worked in

45
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,959
putting those two together he's uh going

46
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,360
to go back to Germany to do a postto in

47
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:06,199
bioinformatics and we'll uh you know I'm

48
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,478
sure he'll do great things but you know

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,479
every graduate student brings the

50
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:10,759
strengths and

51
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,200
weaknesses uh

52
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:17,239
to to graduate school but I what I

53
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:20,159
really want to highlight uh about Travis

54
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,759
is this perspective he has on science

55
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,159
and you know he was one of the graduate

56
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,799
students I would argue that has thought

57
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,680
more deeply about how Science and

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,560
Technology should be developed and you

59
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,439
know he really was asking fundamental

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,519
questions about what does it mean to

61
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:36,878
conduct an experiment you know how

62
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,719
should experiments be repeated how does

63
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,919
one share and repeat these experimental

64
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,439
findings and then you know what are

65
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,280
really the strengths and weaknesses of

66
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:49,800
public sector versus private sector uh

67
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,878
science and you know know I was kind of

68
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,280
Travis I was thinking about it last

69
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,639
night you're kind of like a science

70
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,158
philosopher okay

71
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,079
uh who thinks about some of these things

72
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:01,598
about how do we do science and make it

73
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,920
repeatable but he's also has that blue

74
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,598
collar perspective of getting things

75
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,759
done like plant breeders need to get

76
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,839
things done and it's that combination of

77
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,878
things that's been really uh wonderful

78
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,400
and so he's really been a leader not

79
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,158
only in our lab but across the community

80
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,640
and establishing rigorous methods for

81
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:20,439
Designing and setting up scientific

82
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,798
computational pipelines so that our

83
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,680
science can be

84
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,959
repeatable um and he's combined that

85
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,480
with knowledge of really the the front

86
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,799
of machine learning whether here or

87
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,079
working with Google X and um and though

88
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,519
although we teased Travis about his

89
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,200
smartphone um uh which he has an

90
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,920
americanmade open- Source smartphone

91
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,719
which probably took him about six months

92
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,719
to make it so he could take a picture or

93
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:53,479
something like that I mean you

94
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,759
know longer okay I mean took a year

95
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:58,679
before you could get the thing to take a

96
00:03:54,759 --> 00:04:00,798
picture okay you know but it really

97
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,079
emphasizes the way he tackles problems

98
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,799
he wants to understand how things work

99
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,920
and work on systems that are you know

100
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,280
other people can participate in and I

101
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:15,359
think it's as machine learning and AI

102
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,120
become really even more distant uh and

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,759
unrelatable to people I think Travis is

104
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,879
really there trying to make sure that

105
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,960
we're doing science and apply these

106
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,959
incredible powerful Tools in a way

107
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,839
that's uh democratizing and really

108
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,719
available to us so Travis take it away

109
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:35,079
and tell us all about how genes work and

110
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,360
uh what we can do with that

111
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,359
knowledge all

112
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:46,918
right well thank you very much Ed um and

113
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:48,478
for the record if I allowed my phone to

114
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:51,279
install Zoom I would definitely be

115
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,399
presenting from it today but um

116
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,239
regardless that's not what you're here

117
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,959
to uh listen to me talk about but rather

118
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,800
the culmination of my uh PhD work that

119
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,758
I've titled for a rabbit Ops assia

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,560
learning conserves cyst mechanisms of

121
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,600
Gene

122
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,199
regulation classic uh so my PhD has been

123
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,560
broadly focused on these two research

124
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,879
questions the first is where are the

125
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,000
causal Loi in CIS regulatory regions and

126
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,719
second how do we transfer knowledge

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,839
across

128
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,680
species and I'm talking to a breeding

129
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,159
audience you might be wondering why I'm

130
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,240
mentioning causal Loi and the reality is

131
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,240
that if you want to do efficient genome

132
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,280
editing you need to know where the ca

133
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,240
ofi are to edit them and genome editing

134
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,198
is just the latest uh methodology in the

135
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,560
massive toolbox that plant breeders have

136
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,439
to make genetic gain so to borrow Ed's

137
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,038
software analogy we can see that

138
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,478
breeding methodologies have gone through

139
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,839
sort of four major software revisions

140
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,680
version one unconscious and and mass

141
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,560
selection moving to version two where we

142
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,199
get an idea of inheritance control

143
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,800
genetics to version three with marker

144
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,639
based methods and later on genomic

145
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,439
selection and now today being inv verion

146
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,160
4 with tools such as genetic

147
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,680
transformation and genome editing and I

148
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,680
want to emphasize here that all of these

149
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,680
add on to each other genome editing is

150
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,519
certainly useful for classes of traits

151
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,879
and problems but it doesn't replace

152
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,879
other methods um

153
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,840
everywhere but uh marker based methods

154
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,199
are known to be poorly suited for

155
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:25,198
actually finding these causal Loi and

156
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,038
for a number of different reasons one

157
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,038
there's an ascertainment bias in the

158
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,800
marker sets that are typically used uh

159
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,318
to fit these models they're a subset of

160
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,439
the total pool of genomic variation that

161
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,800
exists in in populations and further

162
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,038
you're only sampling the natural

163
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,319
variation and if your trait requires um

164
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:44,279
some novel non-natural variation then

165
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,800
that's not an option or doesn't exist in

166
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,638
these marker

167
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,478
sets and second uh even if you were to

168
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
sample all of the variation within a

169
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,800
population you still quickly run into

170
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
this NP problem where you have a lot

171
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,360
more variants to estimate effects for

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,240
than you have observations in your

173
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,919
breeding program

174
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,120
so the question becomes what's the right

175
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,159
causal Locus funnel how do we go from

176
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,000
for example on the order of 83 million

177
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,199
Snips in Elite ma germ plasm down to an

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,800
order of about 10,000 Snips that we can

179
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,879
start to either

180
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,759
edit my second question going back is

181
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,960
how do we transfer knowledge across

182
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,639
species and so why might we want to do

183
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,839
this well in the future we're going to

184
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,879
potentially need to breed thousands of

185
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,839
species historically breeding has

186
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,639
focused uh their efforts on the food

187
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,758
yield traits in about 10 or so species

188
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,639
but with uh increasing mean average

189
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,879
temperatures some species up to

190
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,400
thousands might need help being migrated

191
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,520
to cooler climates and we're going to

192
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,638
need to scale efforts in those without

193
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,839
investing the same amount that we have

194
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,240
in these food yield crops and so I'd

195
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,079
like to know how can we take all the

196
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,158
effort and data sets that we've created

197
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,079
in model plant species and transfer that

198
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:56,918
knowledge into specialty in orphan

199
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,719
crops but it's known that these

200
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,560
marker-based methods struggle to predict

201
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,879
across distant populations so we need

202
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,800
new methods in order to actually do this

203
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,360
transfer of knowledge across

204
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,560
species and so how do we do

205
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,479
that we can do that by looking at

206
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,598
conserved mechanisms and using those to

207
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,439
transfer knowledge so the central dogma

208
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:18,759
obeyed by all across the Tree of Life um

209
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,240
things like chromatin that all

210
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,560
eukariotic genomes uh organize

211
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,560
themselves

212
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,120
into and why should we use other species

213
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:31,240
to train models so first more species is

214
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,399
simply more training data and the Deep

215
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,200
learning models that I'm going to

216
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,479
present to you guys today require

217
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,200
relatively large training data sets and

218
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,440
this starts to alleviate the N less than

219
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,759
P

220
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,959
problem and if you can build models that

221
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,480
can predict in heldout species this is a

222
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,958
pretty strong validation that your model

223
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,159
is learning some biology um because we

224
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,159
know that functional sequences are

225
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:55,559
shared across long evolutionary

226
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,079
distances and it also helps you detect

227
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,319
when you're overfitting when you're in

228
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,839
poor NP regimes

229
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,079
and finally it helps prevent the

230
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,079
memorization of

231
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:06,559
retrotransposons and because they evolve

232
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,919
faster than their host genome they're

233
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,759
less likely to be shared across

234
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,078
evolutionary distances and this helps

235
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,759
prevent the common problem with machine

236
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:15,479
learning methods that sort of memorize

237
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,039
that retro elements are common in

238
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,720
regulatory regions and don't learn the

239
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:22,679
real biology about those regulatory

240
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,680
regions and just become transpose on

241
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,919
finders all right so just a quick

242
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,000
overview of what I'm going to talk to

243
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,000
you guys about today or my PhD in a

244
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,639
slide so we're going to start the DNA to

245
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,320
chromatin model move into an

246
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,519
expression-based model that takes in the

247
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,480
promoter and utr sequence go into some

248
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,399
bioph formatics work I've been doing to

249
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,759
find the functional transcription Factor

250
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,839
binding sites from DNA multiple sequence

251
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,200
alignments and finish off with a really

252
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,440
wonderful collaboration with the folks

253
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,480
at University of Washington where uh we

254
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,120
built a core promoter to expression

255
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,240
model all right so DNA to

256
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,039
chromatin so I'm going to go through

257
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,959
what chromatin is and how we commonly

258
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,319
measure it why is it relevant for

259
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:06,399
breeding why do I think that we can even

260
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,000
predict chromatin state from DNA and as

261
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,240
a hint we need both a concered

262
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,958
vocabulary and grammar which I'll get

263
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,240
into why are CNN's the model I'm using

264
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,199
here well suited for this how did I

265
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,159
train them and how well do they

266
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,040
work so we know that eukariotic DNA is

267
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:26,199
organized into chromatin and so we can

268
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:28,480
see here some cartoon representations of

269
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,480
histone proteins that DNA wraps itself

270
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,839
around and and when they're particularly

271
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,399
compact these even though these DNA

272
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,360
sequences have transcription Factor

273
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,879
binding sites they can't be bound by

274
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,600
transcription factors unless they're

275
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:42,480
more accessible and they can't then

276
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,600
therefore regulate gene

277
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,600
expression so we measure chromatin

278
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,800
accessibility many different ways one of

279
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,200
which is a tax seek and basically a tax

280
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,559
seek measures where a trans a massive

281
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,959
transpose a comes in and can cut and it

282
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,838
cuts preferentially in accessible

283
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:00,679
regions these cut sites can be are put

284
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,920
on the end of reads and you can align

285
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:04,799
them to the genome and call Peaks from

286
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:09,559
them so these blue squares for example

287
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,559
are binarized one or zero accessible or

288
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,719
non-accessible another interesting

289
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:15,919
result recently seen in the grasses is

290
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,879
that many of these accessible regions

291
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,240
across tissues almost all of them across

292
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:22,759
tissues are also DNA

293
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,600
unmethylated um and this is really

294
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,480
interesting because accessible chromatin

295
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,079
is highly Dynamic over developmental

296
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
time and so a lot of the Peaks aren't

297
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:30,958
shared across tissues and we want to

298
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,479
build models of them they have to be

299
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,159
tissue somewhat specific but if we can

300
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,759
build a single model of DNA methylation

301
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,600
then we can take it in one tissue

302
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,679
because DNA methylation is relatively

303
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,680
stable over developmental time and only

304
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,719
use one model to predict these

305
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,879
regions and I'm going to be referring to

306
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,680
these peaks of DNA lack of DNA

307
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,320
methylation as umrs and they're um Peaks

308
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,679
where there is a lack of DNA methylation

309
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,399
in all three context and just as a sort

310
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,919
of example you can see how consistent

311
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,078
they are in this region across leaf

312
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:04,599
Roots so why should breeders care about

313
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:06,919
accessible chromosone well we know that

314
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,159
they actually contain functional variant

315
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,599
so some prior work in the lab looked at

316
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:13,519
the heritability proportion assignable

317
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,920
to Snips in coding regions versus

318
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,679
accessible chromatin regions across

319
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,519
about 40 or so agronomic traits and what

320
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,000
they saw is that Snips within coding

321
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,759
regions explain almost as much

322
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,078
heritability as Snips within coding

323
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:29,439
regions which we already know are

324
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:32,239
important so this has relevance

325
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,399
so can we predict chromatin State uh

326
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,480
directly from DNA sequence and why might

327
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,799
we want to well only about 5% of the

328
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,240
maze genome is unmethylated and so this

329
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,879
would result in about a 20x reduction in

330
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,919
the Target space that we can mutate

331
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:50,919
within or should mutate

332
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:53,159
within and quickly why DNA based models

333
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:54,639
um specifically so first they are

334
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,879
alignment free and this is a common

335
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,600
roadblock when you're doing cross

336
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:00,320
species analyses how do you get good

337
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,879
cross species alignments it can be very

338
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,639
tricky second some samples we can only

339
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,078
assay with DNA sequence for example if

340
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,519
you're collecting from an herbarium or

341
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,719
other dead tissue samples it's really

342
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,320
impossible to do something like

343
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,320
chromatin as saying on those um and

344
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,879
nowadays DNA sequencing is relatively

345
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,079
cheap compared to things like attack

346
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,759
seek or

347
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,919
chipseek um also we have a pretty good

348
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,958
idea on how DNA behaves over Generations

349
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,919
so we can model reconstructed ancestors

350
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:30,359
or predicted plant bre uh breeding

351
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,360
program progeny and use those models to

352
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,039
predict functional aspects of those

353
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,039
non-existent

354
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,639
organisms and so it's this really this

355
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,160
grammar between the transcription Factor

356
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,278
binding sites that should be a strong

357
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,519
ratory signal from the genomic

358
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,399
background and it could be helpful to

359
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,759
think of these regulatory segments as a

360
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,440
DNA in general as sort of a sentence so

361
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,800
the vocabulary are these transcription

362
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,880
Factor binding sites so these colored

363
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,799
rectangles I'm showing here and the

364
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,439
grammar is the spatial relationship or

365
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,278
the co-binding between these motifs and

366
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,880
because the vocab is kind of is short

367
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,879
and very degenerate it's they occur

368
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:10,480
randomly by chance throughout the genome

369
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,000
and just one tfbs is not really enough

370
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,480
to say that that's regulatory but if you

371
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,120
sudden suddenly see a lot of them

372
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,000
together in a certain orientation that's

373
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,639
a better

374
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,120
signal but are these things conserved

375
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,000
across species we want to build across

376
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,679
species models we need to leverage

377
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,198
that so there's a reason to think from

378
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:33,278
theory that these vocab is conserved at

379
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:35,000
least across plants because we know that

380
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,360
the origin of a lot of these

381
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,078
transcription Factor binding domains

382
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,519
predate the plant expansion and so

383
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:46,278
therefore the motifs they bind to should

384
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,679
be highly conserved and common in plant

385
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:50,519
genomes and as a more concrete example

386
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:53,638
more recent work out of the lab trained

387
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:56,159
CER binding models for about 100 or so

388
00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:00,120
maze transcription factors and so they

389
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:02,639
related whether or not a CER uh was more

390
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,159
present in a region Bound by a certain

391
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:09,320
TF and if you take all of those TFS and

392
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:11,319
you build a tree out of based on the the

393
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,759
relationship between those camer weights

394
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,680
you can get this sort of tree that was

395
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,600
built in Maze and what's exciting to see

396
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,439
is if you start to color those tips by

397
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,399
the orthologous transcription factor in

398
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,279
a arabidopsis the colors also Group by

399
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,759
the tree suggesting that there is some

400
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:31,480
conservation of that binding uh

401
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,480
vocabulary across at least the

402
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:36,399
angiosperms so going back we know that

403
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,078
the vocab is pro is likely to be

404
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,078
conserved at least there's some evidence

405
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,559
but we really don't know if the grammar

406
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,278
is highly conserved and so that's my

407
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,039
main hypothesis going into this work is

408
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:49,000
that the grammar is conserved and we can

409
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:51,559
use that to predict romtin state from

410
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,318
sequence so just an overview of the sort

411
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,518
of classifier we're going to build here

412
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,919
going from a window of DNA sequence can

413
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,639
we put it into a model and get some 0

414
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,679
to1 prediction of whether it's

415
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,799
inaccessible accessible methylated or

416
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,278
unmethylated we already know that CNN's

417
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,439
the model I'm using here are pretty well

418
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,519
suited for this kind of task what I'm

419
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,519
showing here is results from 2015 one of

420
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,679
the first CNN's deep sea to be applied

421
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,360
to this uh in humans and so we know that

422
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,439
this is a good classifier because all of

423
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,600
these black lines which which represent

424
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,319
accessibility in different tissues are

425
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,120
far away from this diagonal which would

426
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:30,159
be what the random classifier would be

427
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,240
at and a year later this other model Dan

428
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,919
Q showed that it can do slightly better

429
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,919
across all chromatin tasks that I just

430
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:39,399
showed previously um so these CNN models

431
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,719
seem to be

432
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:45,318
working and also much more recent work

433
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,959
in plants in 2011 or 2021 showed that

434
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:51,078
they also do work well with high area

435
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,078
under the curves close to

436
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,639
one so just a brief overview of what

437
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:59,360
CNN's are and how they work so you can

438
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,198
one hot encode DNA as a matrix

439
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,759
and the convolutional layer in these

440
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,798
cnns one of the first layers is going to

441
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,519
scan over in Windows and it's going to

442
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:09,639
match these convolutional Kels to each

443
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,918
window and over time it's going to learn

444
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,520
what motifs are important to predict

445
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,280
whatever your target is um and those

446
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,160
when it finds a match is going to result

447
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:21,199
in a high value that goes into later

448
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,360
layers and so this is well suited for

449
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,360
this sort of like detection of motifs

450
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,879
problem and I use the Dan Q model here

451
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,879
specifically that I mentioned just prev

452
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,760
prly because it also has this lstm layer

453
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,559
which is a recurrent layer that allows

454
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,038
you to learn not just whether a motif is

455
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:38,798
present in a sequence but also the

456
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,480
co-presence of motifs and what their

457
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,400
spatial relationships are and this is

458
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,640
exactly what I think should be a strong

459
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,038
discriminator uh from genomic background

460
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,520
to regulatory regions like I said

461
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,079
earlier these models are pretty large

462
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:52,639
and uh danq has about 1.6 million

463
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,158
parameters and it's fairly small model

464
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,320
for for these

465
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:00,320
days so the data that I'm going to use

466
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:02,960
to train it uh is is chromatin data

467
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,480
across the angiosperms from both uh

468
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,360
monocots and dcot so things like grape

469
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,880
common Bean soybean and then your

470
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,479
grasses like rice Ma and sorghum and I

471
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,400
have aack seek in about 10 or 12 of

472
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,720
those species and methylation data in

473
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,840
about 10 of them in total that results

474
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,079
in about 312,000 attack seek Peaks

475
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:25,439
across these species and about 360,000

476
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,798
umrs so not quite above P yet but in a

477
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,759
much better space than if we were to

478
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,759
just train in one of these species

479
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,879
so how are we going to do this I'm going

480
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,519
to train the model in two different ways

481
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,400
one within species to compare to

482
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:40,879
previous literature and in another

483
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,480
across species so first for within

484
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,039
species we'll take the Peaks under one

485
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,038
chromosome and assign them to our test

486
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,359
set we'll assign the rest to our

487
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:50,558
training set we're going to down sample

488
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,079
so that there's a balance between our

489
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:53,759
black and blue or accessible

490
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,319
inaccessible regions and just so you can

491
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,879
see now 3: one to one:

492
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:01,519
one and then we can get some performance

493
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,200
metric for that model within the species

494
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,839
on the test set and we can do that for

495
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,080
both accessibility and

496
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,918
methylation for the across species model

497
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,720
we'll assign the same Peaks to the test

498
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,679
set so that we can have an even

499
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,880
comparison between the two and then

500
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,519
we'll assign training peaks in the other

501
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,960
uh species down sample again to balance

502
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,240
and now we have two bars that we can

503
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,480
compare on the same arabidopsis Peaks

504
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,640
for both accessibility and

505
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,079
methylation and so long story short it

506
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,759
turns out yes we can build models that

507
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,918
predict chromatin State across

508
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,720
angiosperms so for example I'm showing

509
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,440
the methylation first um we can see that

510
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,679
generally the orange and the blue bars

511
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,320
are pretty close to each other sometimes

512
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:47,000
reversed but the across species models

513
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,798
seem to be very competitive to models

514
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,319
trained solely within species even

515
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,440
though they have to go across a longer

516
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,839
evolutionary

517
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,000
distance and the same case is true for

518
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,079
the accessibility if not more so what's

519
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,079
interesting is if we have heavy sampling

520
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:02,918
within specific clades they seem to do a

521
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,759
lot better than the across species

522
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,919
models suggesting if we can fill out the

523
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,960
tree a little bit more we can do even

524
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,480
better with across species models across

525
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,279
the

526
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,038
angiosperms and I also just want to

527
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,639
highlight we don't expect these Cy based

528
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:17,158
models to be perfect for predicting

529
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,880
chromatin State we know that there are

530
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,320
trans effects that come in from other

531
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,159
areas of the genome that can silence

532
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,558
these regions even without any change in

533
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,360
the sequence underlying them and I'll

534
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:30,158
talk about those in a

535
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:33,199
second so what I asked next was what

536
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,240
region does the model do best or worst

537
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,640
in so I divided the genome up into

538
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,038
either genic regions that overlap Gene

539
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,960
annotations uh proximal regions that

540
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:44,200
over are within 2kb of either the

541
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,919
transcription start site or the uh

542
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,360
termination site and everything else is

543
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,159
distal and what I saw is that generally

544
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,399
the model does best on accessibility in

545
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:54,480
these proximal regions and worst on

546
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,200
these disle

547
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,599
regions and it's a very similar case for

548
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,600
the methylation models

549
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:04,839
so diving a little bit deeper I noticed

550
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,960
that a lot of the accessibility errors

551
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,879
the model's making are false positives

552
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,679
so I'm summing to 100% within each of

553
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,840
these columns and you'll notice that

554
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,919
excuse me about 70% of the um

555
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,839
predictions of the model that are open

556
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,480
are actually labeled as closed in the

557
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,000
data so there's a high false positive

558
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,960
rate but I do want to emphasize here

559
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,558
that this is not necessarily wrong

560
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,919
because the attack SE Peaks that I'm

561
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,278
using were cons were called with

562
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,278
relatively conservative thresholds and

563
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:33,919
so if you have some certain Peaks that

564
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:36,159
are open in maybe half of the cell types

565
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,440
or less in this data set those might not

566
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,720
have met the strength needed to be

567
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,880
called in this data set and they might

568
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,120
be open but the model uh doesn't know

569
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,400
that or it suspects that but it's

570
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,199
labeled as closed and

571
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,798
true okay so some of the trans effects I

572
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,240
alluded to earlier um one example of

573
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:55,558
those would be let's say you have a CIS

574
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,278
regulatory module sitting in a

575
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:58,918
transposon which is not an uncommon

576
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:00,839
occurrence

577
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,960
uh and it looks like it should be a a

578
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,839
regulatory module by the sequence but in

579
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,519
reality um some host directed maybe RNA

580
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:11,439
directed DNA methylation might silence

581
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,639
that transposon because of its context

582
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,278
um and our Cy based model might not

583
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,960
necessarily pick up on that so how do we

584
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:20,038
help it out what if we started masking

585
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,360
transposons so we take in in this case

586
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:24,839
let's say 600 base pairs of sequence

587
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:26,599
feed it into our model and then it'll

588
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:28,678
make a prediction and then if it's in a

589
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:30,319
transposon we'll set that prediction as

590
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,320
zero and if it's not we'll keep the

591
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:35,439
original one and see how we

592
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,960
do and if we if we do Mass transposons

593
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,679
we get significant improvements uh in

594
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,400
both accessibility and methylation

595
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,200
suggesting once we start incorporating

596
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,278
those trans effects into our Cy based

597
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,759
models we can actually get to more

598
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:47,759
towards

599
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,960
Perfection next I wanted to look at how

600
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,079
well this these models do across a

601
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,440
number of different cell types so I

602
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:58,278
didn't mention previously but this is

603
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,360
leaf accessibility data so the model is

604
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:02,599
only been trained in one tissue type

605
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:04,558
across species and so I'll have one

606
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:06,278
prediction for each of these Peaks and I

607
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:07,720
wanted to see how well it does across a

608
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:10,359
single cell attack seek that has

609
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,079
multiple cell types in

610
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:14,959
it so going from left to right on the

611
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,678
x-axis here we're moving from tissue

612
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,400
specific Peaks to more generally

613
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:21,120
accessible Peaks and we can see model

614
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,960
performance follows basically how tissue

615
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:23,959
specific you are

616
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,960
inversely and I want to point out here

617
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:31,319
that SCA Tech is is known to be

618
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,319
relatively noisy and so sometimes when

619
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:35,480
you don't have many observations of a

620
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:36,839
peak in or you only have it in very few

621
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,079
nuclei it's hard to tell whether that

622
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:41,678
Peak is noise or a truly cell type

623
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:46,480
specific Peak so this might actually not

624
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:49,559
be uh uh predictable for the

625
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,480
model I also looked at genome wide how

626
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:53,918
does performance differ across cell

627
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,000
types and it doesn't differ that much

628
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,679
promisingly the best uh performing

629
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,798
tissue is the guard cell which is a leaf

630
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,640
cell type that's rate and and one of the

631
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:04,000
worst performing is tro blast or root

632
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,600
hair precursor so promising but there's

633
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,400
still not much of a difference and the

634
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:11,519
reason for this is either many Peaks are

635
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,159
open in in very many tissues or very few

636
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,038
tissues and we know the model does uh

637
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,559
really poorly on distal regions which

638
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:20,640
tend to be more cell type specific Peaks

639
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,960
so across tissues we're not going to do

640
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,400
very well in those regions anyways but

641
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,880
it does very well on regions that are

642
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,798
open in many tissues and that doesn't

643
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,919
change across tissues a lot so kind of

644
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:33,879
explains why the model is sort of

645
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:33,880
consistent across

646
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,480
tissues one of the common criticisms of

647
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,079
deep learning models is understanding

648
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,798
just what they're learning they can make

649
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,839
good predictions but what biology are

650
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:45,839
they learning if any uh to make those

651
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,599
predictions so how do we open up the

652
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,240
black box so to speak one of the ways I

653
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,278
did this was using a method from Peter

654
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,798
Cruz group called Global importance

655
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:56,519
analysis uh and it's sister method

656
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:57,558
positional Global importance analysis so

657
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:00,240
the way that works is we're going to

658
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:02,759
sample some back sequences uh just a

659
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,960
control for potential co-binding motifs

660
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,558
across um uh the background and we're

661
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,399
going to embed some Motif that we're

662
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:11,720
interested in so we can start testing

663
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:13,519
specific Motif hypotheses and in my case

664
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,079
I took a database of known transcription

665
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,278
Factor binding motifs and just started

666
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:18,599
embedding them in these random regions

667
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:20,839
and then you measure the difference

668
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:22,480
between those set of embedded regions

669
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:24,558
and the random background and just see

670
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,120
how your model predictions differ and

671
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,678
it's the average difference between

672
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:29,479
these that is known as the global

673
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,240
importance so how important is that

674
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,360
Motif being in the sequence to your

675
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,919
model for making its

676
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,479
prediction you can embed this Motif not

677
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,880
just in the middle but at any position

678
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,440
and get a very position specific effect

679
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,600
of the global importance for embedding

680
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,600
that

681
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,038
Motif and so then you can start to rank

682
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,038
these motifs by their effect size to the

683
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:51,798
model so in this case I'm ranking them

684
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:53,720
by their maximum positional Global

685
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:55,319
importance so what motifs no matter

686
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,000
where you put them in the sequence are

687
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:59,678
very important for changing the model's

688
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,558
prediction and we can see that for the

689
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,880
accessibility model which had a rabbit

690
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:05,720
opsis held out predicting into a rabbit

691
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,360
opsis sequence it's paying a lot of

692
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,600
attention to TCP family motifs and this

693
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,719
is cool because we know that some tcps

694
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:17,639
can be chromatin remodelers so that's

695
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,120
promising for Maze there are some tcps

696
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,320
but we also see these doth type family

697
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,239
uh transcription Factor motifs ranked

698
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,839
highly we know that they're involved in

699
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,399
seed and seedling development no

700
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,599
chromatin remodeling evidence that I'm

701
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:32,719
aware of but perhaps part of development

702
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:35,798
is is chromatin remodeling in this

703
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,720
case and across both arabidopsis and Ma

704
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:39,960
held out methylation models it's much

705
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,880
more consistent being these bbr bpc

706
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,159
motives or ap2 erf we know there is some

707
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,919
evidence for bbr bpc to do chromatin

708
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:50,799
remodeling cool um and there is evidence

709
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:52,440
that ap2 erf or they're known to be

710
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,599
involved in development but the case is

711
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,278
less

712
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:58,719
clear so in summary uh I've shown that

713
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,599
these recurrent convolution neural

714
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,240
networks can seem to model chromatin

715
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:04,158
accessibility and DNA methylation

716
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,278
directly from sequin and across plant

717
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,960
species and that these across species

718
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:10,000
models are competitive with within

719
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,558
species

720
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,679
models the accessibility a toz models uh

721
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:18,639
seem to perform best on Gene proximal

722
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,720
and commonly accessible

723
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,278
regions and incorporating trans effects

724
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,558
starts to reduce our models CIS based

725
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:29,720
models false positive

726
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:31,398
rates and finally uh these TCP family

727
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,798
motifs seem to rank highly in global

728
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:34,558
importance to the across species

729
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,879
accessibility models and it's a much

730
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:40,440
more consistent case being ap2 erf or BB

731
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,278
bbr bpc for

732
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,080
methylation all right so moving right

733
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:49,200
along to our expression model or my

734
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:50,759
expression model I guess um so one of

735
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,360
the motivations for making this model

736
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:54,038
was to try to move towards some more

737
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:56,879
efficient promoter bashing and so

738
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:59,079
promoter bashing is where you'll take um

739
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,960
random guide targets of stream of a gene

740
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:03,038
and just start trying to make mutants

741
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,079
until you see the effect that you want

742
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,759
and they're untargeted but what if we

743
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,519
can build a promoter model that can

744
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:10,679
instead reduce the space that we would

745
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,720
need to randomly Bash from on the order

746
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,880
of 2,000 base pairs to more like a 100

747
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,278
or

748
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,919
so so plenty of uh human expression

749
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:22,119
models already exist in the literature

750
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,038
and I'm going to test four of them here

751
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:26,798
uh the first is fnet compression which

752
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:30,000
is a relatively tiny model at 60,000

753
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:33,000
parameters hyena DN a more recent one at

754
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,880
450,000 Dan Q we're familiar with at 1.6

755
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,240
million and Informer is currently

756
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,880
state-ofthe-art at about 250 million

757
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,359
parameters I couldn't quite get

758
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,519
informative run on the hardware I had

759
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:46,759
available so I down sampled it to about

760
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,399
50 million and called it mini

761
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:52,398
former uh some previous work in the lab

762
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:54,719
also showed if you have coding sequence

763
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,278
going into your model then there's a

764
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,558
potential for that model to start to

765
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:01,558
memorize Gene family

766
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,398
and so in this case if you have things

767
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:05,240
that are looking like transcription

768
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:06,759
factors for example in their coding

769
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,679
regions then the model just tend to

770
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,798
think that oh if you're a transcription

771
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:12,720
Factor you tend to be lowly expressed

772
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,240
versus something that is more highly

773
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,120
expressed and not learn anything about

774
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,200
the cyst regulation differences between

775
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,918
the two that actually explain

776
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,120
expression so there's a couple of

777
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,120
different uh uh ways to improve existing

778
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,639
expression models the first as I've

779
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,038
mentioned previously with thin species

780
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,480
models have limited independent training

781
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,599
observations second if you don't mask

782
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,200
your coding regions then that can enable

783
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,480
overfitting on Gene

784
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,360
family it's also been seen that there's

785
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,159
a poor recall of these models on rare

786
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,719
eqtl wheels for example um a lot of

787
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,039
these expression models just fail to

788
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,880
detect even high effect eqtl if they're

789
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,879
not present at high

790
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,799
frequency and there as of today uh well

791
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:58,398
before this work there was no level

792
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:59,759
comparison between all of these

793
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,479
architectures so it's hard to tell

794
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,079
whether this model was better because it

795
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,960
had a different data set or the problem

796
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:06,720
was easier and so I wanted to make sure

797
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,038
that we can test everything on on a

798
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,440
Level Playing

799
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:15,599
Field and so the data I'm using to train

800
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,759
these models are uh 32 new uh long read

801
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,240
genomes and RNA seek data from Wild

802
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,558
relatives of Maze and this is these

803
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,399
genomes are really the result of

804
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:26,200
collaborative effort between Arun Cam

805
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:27,639
and Michelle Stitzer um along with

806
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,319
collaborators at the danforce center

807
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,360
Taylor and Toby who actually did the

808
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:35,678
sampling of these um species and it

809
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:39,240
spans the uh andragonia tribe of which

810
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,240
Ma and sorghum are a part

811
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,720
of and so the schema for this uh model

812
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,880
is I'm going to train on the relatives

813
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,480
of Maze and try to predict in maze so

814
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,200
very similar to the last Model um but

815
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,880
also following the advice from the

816
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,399
previous lab work I'm also going to do

817
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,880
the orthog group guided splitting so in

818
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,278
this case I'm going to have a holdout

819
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,399
set of genes that are in different

820
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,079
orthog groups for my training set and

821
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:08,278
also in different species so this is a

822
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:10,398
very difficult problem in total I have

823
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:13,278
about a million training observations

824
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,278
for these expression

825
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,919
models so in my model I'm going to start

826
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:22,119
uh at the translation start site and go

827
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:23,919
one kilobase pair Upstream of the

828
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:26,558
translation start site and try to

829
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,639
predict the uh expression levels either

830
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,079
in specific tissues like Leaf stem or

831
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:34,158
flow or the maximum expression across

832
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:37,960
tissues or the binarized form of that

833
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:40,200
onoff expression in any

834
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,798
tissue and I want to highlight that the

835
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,798
within Gene performance is not

836
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:45,079
necessarily equal to a cross Gene

837
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:46,720
performance and a cross Gene is

838
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:49,240
typically what's been shown in the

839
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,399
literature excuse me what I mean by a

840
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,399
cross Gene is if you take a look across

841
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:55,000
all the genes in the genome and all the

842
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:57,918
species that you have in your training

843
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,440
or test set if you can correctly set

844
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,880
separate the highly expressed geneses

845
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,320
from the lowly expressed genes it

846
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,799
doesn't mean that you have the ability

847
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,638
to distinguish between for example

848
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:08,200
closely related orthologues so it's

849
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:10,319
classic Simpsons Paradox situation where

850
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,960
you looks good between groups but then

851
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,000
you start to go within groups and your

852
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,000
correlation levels

853
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,038
drop so first just to compare to

854
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,158
existing literature the across Gene

855
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,720
regression results are about equal to a

856
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,720
within human Benchmark what's cool to

857
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,120
see is one of my best performing models

858
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,240
on one of the best performing tasks

859
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:33,439
maximum expression is about 0.52 and

860
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:36,200
it's Dan q and the within human data in

861
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,558
former gets to about 0.57 so we're

862
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:43,038
almost there not quite but these models

863
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:43,038
are predicting across species in this

864
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,159
case I also compared it to the previous

865
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:50,079
work from the lab that did this within

866
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:51,720
maze so for the onoff expression model

867
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:55,079
uh one of the best models is fnet

868
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,278
compression at an a rock of 77 and this

869
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:59,678
is exactly equal to the model that was

870
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,440
trained Within in maze that took in only

871
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,038
promoter regions and I want you to

872
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,558
notice there's also a slightly better

873
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,398
model that took in both promoter and

874
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,599
Terminator and we'll get into that a

875
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:12,319
second but first the within Gene

876
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,359
performance dramatically drops uh once

877
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:17,599
you start looking across orthologs

878
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:20,119
within maze so I was showing cross Gene

879
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:23,519
correlations of on the order of

880
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:24,839
0.56 but within genes across different

881
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,319
orthologues

882
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:28,319
the uh average correlation drops to

883
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:29,918
about

884
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,398
and there's not really much difference

885
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,759
between even or models of several orders

886
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,359
of magnitude parameter difference and

887
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:38,240
it's only slightly better on average on

888
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:41,519
the maximum expression

889
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,120
task and this agrees with the same

890
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,919
Benchmark that looked at this in human

891
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:49,199
on Informer the current State ofthe art

892
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,200
um in

893
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:54,158
pattern so looking at one of my best

894
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,000
models Dan Q again uh just sort of

895
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,880
emphasize that how poorly it ranks these

896
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,038
orthologues by abundance I'm looking on

897
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,960
the x-axis here the predicted expression

898
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,319
change by the model between any pair of

899
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,759
orthologues on the log 10 scale and then

900
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,918
we're looking at the observed expression

901
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,358
chains and generally it's just not doing

902
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,320
well for anything except things that are

903
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:14,398
more towards the Tails so until you get

904
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,519
to about a hundred or a thousand uh

905
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:20,118
times x expression increase it doesn't

906
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,838
it's not able to differentiate perhaps

907
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:23,440
the model's overfitting quickly on these

908
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,878
huge expression differences and never

909
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,800
really gets a chance to uh finally

910
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:30,559
distinguish expression

911
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,079
another thing that might be going on is

912
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,000
the previous work in the group showed

913
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,519
that really it's the three prime ETR and

914
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,398
the Terminator uh that was needed to

915
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:39,759
distinguish between at least ma

916
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,878
orthologues

917
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,879
um and so potentially what the model

918
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:47,358
needs is to also include that sequence

919
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:49,440
but I also want to emphasize again that

920
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,159
if if we do this future work really

921
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,398
needs to make sure to mass those coding

922
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,398
regions so it doesn't memorize Gene

923
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,599
family I also looked at where the uh Dan

924
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,440
Q model was paying attention for

925
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,119
predicting expression levels in the max

926
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,159
expression task and what's cool to see

927
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,800
is it actually highlights the core

928
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:12,440
promoter so note I didn't give the model

929
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,079
the transcription start site I started

930
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,200
at the translation start site and I've

931
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,640
sort of manual manually aligned these

932
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:19,719
important scores for you to the

933
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:22,358
transcription start site and it

934
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:24,000
highlights across all the maze genes the

935
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:27,519
core promoter which is we know is

936
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,519
important for expression

937
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,160
yeah okay the other thing I looked at is

938
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,679
it's a common refrain in deep learning

939
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:36,879
that we need more training data more

940
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:38,078
data better models um and I wanted to

941
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,599
know if that was actually the case

942
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,119
because that data doesn't come for free

943
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,320
um so I took various subsets of my

944
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,200
training data starting at very small

945
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,640
fractions of it and gradually increasing

946
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,439
it to the 1 million uh number of

947
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:53,039
observations and I do see the

948
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,400
performance between the 500 and a

949
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,838
million is still increasing suggesting

950
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,920
there is a need for more training data

951
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,279
depending on the price point at which it

952
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,119
costs to acquire

953
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,160
it so in summary it seems the current

954
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,920
genomic deep learning architectures

955
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:11,519
perform well across dently related

956
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,280
species and this agrees with human bench

957
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,079
within human benchmarks in both pattern

958
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,560
and magnitude and it has nearly the same

959
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,160
performance as maze models without

960
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:22,358
seeing any maze

961
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,399
sequence they don't seem to be sensitive

962
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:26,598
enough yet to rank closely related

963
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,960
sequence which agrees with wi the human

964
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:31,200
Benchmark as well perhaps we need three

965
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,480
prime utr but I also think it's

966
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,679
interesting to think about if the three

967
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,318
prime utrs uh region that Evolution has

968
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,199
happened to favor to find tune

969
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:41,800
expression or if it is actually needed

970
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:45,480
to find tune

971
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,519
expression so in the third point is that

972
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,240
the models do seem to recognize the core

973
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,318
promoter as important across all genes

974
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:52,838
that's a good

975
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:54,920
validation uh and it seems we do could

976
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:58,799
use some more training data uh to

977
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,000
saturate the performance of these models

978
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,960
all right so moving on to a more

979
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,159
biomatics focused approach looking at

980
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,159
multiple sequence alignments to predict

981
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:09,960
functional transcription Factor binding

982
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:11,559
sites so why functional transcription

983
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,280
Factor binding sites well compareed to

984
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:16,000
an accessible chromatin model if we can

985
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,119
actually find the the real uh binding

986
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,559
sites that would be even a more

987
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,559
efficient editing Target because not

988
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,480
every base pair an accessible region is

989
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,838
necessarily A binding

990
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,960
site and I kind of alluded to this

991
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:29,838
before but Motif scanning if you just

992
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,079
take known motifs and scan them across

993
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,599
the genome there's a high false positive

994
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,240
rate so if you look at any random

995
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,559
promoter Upstream you're just going to

996
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:39,078
see a lot of hits and they overlap and

997
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:40,719
there's there's a lot of them but how

998
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:43,318
many of them are actually functional

999
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,919
which ones are functional and this is so

1000
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:48,440
bad that uh these authors kind of uh

1001
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,400
exasperatedly conjectured in 2004 that

1002
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,440
this futility theorem means that about

1003
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,039
100% of your predicted binding sites are

1004
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,240
nonfunctional three orders of magnitude

1005
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:00,079
difference but we can use other

1006
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,399
information to filter down these methods

1007
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,318
such as evolutionary conservation so if

1008
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,119
you do your Motif scanning as usual and

1009
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:08,039
you detect a region of the genome that's

1010
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,838
more conserved over time it's more

1011
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:11,599
evidence that these are actually doing

1012
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:14,679
something and this has been known for a

1013
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,920
while as philogenetic

1014
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:19,598
footprinting but why use phalogenic

1015
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,280
footprinting now what's changed so first

1016
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,559
there's new aligners on the scene like

1017
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,560
anchor wave that can handle these plant

1018
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:29,078
energenic regions much better uh than

1019
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:31,480
previously this is important where a lot

1020
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:32,880
of these non-coding uh in these

1021
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,280
non-coding regions there's a lot of

1022
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,000
regulatory regions that we want to study

1023
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,440
their

1024
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,079
conservation also I mentioned we have 32

1025
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,318
new highquality long read antropia

1026
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,680
assemblies and we also have 400 new

1027
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:51,199
short read anagon assemblies to even

1028
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,199
increase the depth of these msas

1029
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,599
further and so all of these assemblies

1030
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:00,119
came from uh the NSF pan and Grant which

1031
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:02,000
collected about 800 anagon samples

1032
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,720
worldwide as I mentioned previously

1033
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,599
colleagues at the Danforth Center Taylor

1034
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:08,598
aashan Elder and Toby Kellogg uh run

1035
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,160
around the world and collected andon

1036
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:13,480
from fresh uh tissue samples or either

1037
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:16,920
went into herbariums and silica

1038
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,920
collections to get these

1039
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,159
samples and so if you build a tree out

1040
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:22,719
of all these samples and you Sum along

1041
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:24,759
all the the branches in that tree they

1042
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:27,480
sample approximately on the order of

1043
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,520
about a billion years of evolution which

1044
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,559
comes out to about 30 to 5050 mutations

1045
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:35,239
per base pair so a very powerful data

1046
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:35,239
set to measure

1047
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,160
constraint and so if you look at these

1048
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,920
short read assemblies which are thanks

1049
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:42,838
to the efforts of twe and cinta for the

1050
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,318
sequencing and Amy and Charlie for the

1051
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,239
assembly um if we look at the bootco

1052
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:49,199
completeness of these assemblies

1053
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:51,000
generally they seem to be fairly

1054
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,838
complete and if the genes aren't

1055
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,400
complete they're at least FR uh present

1056
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:59,318
in a majority uh fragment so fairly

1057
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,318
contiguous

1058
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,760
and so as part of the long read assembly

1059
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,760
work a collaborator Armen uh Sheen took

1060
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,560
the long read assemblies and used the

1061
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,760
cactus genome aligner to build a

1062
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:13,679
multiple sequence alignment between them

1063
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,400
across all 32 and then he used fastc

1064
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,039
cons to do that philogenetic put

1065
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,800
footprinting I talked about earlier and

1066
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:23,318
find the conserved non-coding sequences

1067
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,880
or CNS and in maze there's about 95,000

1068
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:28,440
of them that he

1069
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,880
detected so now now my work comes into

1070
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,039
adding in those short read assemblies to

1071
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,200
see if we can get further depth in these

1072
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:36,400
uh alignments so starting with a species

1073
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:37,838
tree that contains the non-ref which I'm

1074
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,318
referring to the short read assemblies

1075
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,679
as and the ref the long read we can

1076
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:44,960
align the non- reference Contex to the

1077
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:47,239
nearest reference assembly so we can

1078
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,960
avoid some of the reference bias and

1079
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,959
then use that Cactus alignment to lift

1080
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,400
over all of these alignments into the

1081
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,880
same MSA space and get msas of these

1082
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:01,960
conserved non-coding regions that have

1083
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:04,519
hundreds of anon assemblies in

1084
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,400
them what I noticed looking at some of

1085
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:09,719
these CNS regions is that only about

1086
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,318
60,000 of those are widely covered

1087
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:13,000
across the an bergonia there are a

1088
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:15,199
subset of them that are only present

1089
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,599
across a number of the long read

1090
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:19,039
assemblies and we uh sampled heavily in

1091
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,280
the zeia clade for the long read

1092
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,759
assemblies um and I wanted to focus this

1093
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,599
analysis on things that were present

1094
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:29,119
across everything so I decided to filter

1095
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:31,760
out to this upper right CL quadrant here

1096
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,160
so that brings me down to about

1097
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,800
60,000 the next thing I did was use the

1098
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:39,598
Jasper transcription Factor database to

1099
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,519
scan for those motifs with the Fimo tool

1100
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,960
and so looking at a real example of an

1101
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:45,559
alignment within one of these CNS

1102
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,199
regions we can imagine that there are

1103
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:51,880
some Motif hits within it right here and

1104
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,519
I'm going to use fast so the same set

1105
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,760
that contains fast cons to test whether

1106
00:41:54,519 --> 00:42:00,480
these motifs as a region are more

1107
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,680
constrained than the bases around them

1108
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,000
and I'm going to do some very simple

1109
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,318
filtering to get rid of these uh very

1110
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,039
gappy

1111
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:10,079
columns and so when I do that and run

1112
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,318
the the test I get about

1113
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,920
56,000 uh transcription Factor binding

1114
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:17,480
sites in maze that are constrained uh to

1115
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:21,039
the bond coron correct Bond foni

1116
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,039
corrected P value across

1117
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:26,039
panand okay so the next thing I wanted

1118
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,280
to do is look for binding preferences in

1119
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,639
these across these motifs and so to do

1120
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,359
that I did an all byall alignment of the

1121
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,239
constrained motifs that I detected also

1122
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,440
along with all the Jasper motifs from

1123
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:39,719
the database and so since some of these

1124
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,519
motifs are shorter or longer than others

1125
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:43,598
I took the longest Motif and I slid the

1126
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:46,159
shorter one across in all possible

1127
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,400
positions and took the minimum of the

1128
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:50,920
ukian distance between the two and used

1129
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,160
that as the alignment score and it has

1130
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,318
to be ukian this is a common Motif

1131
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:57,639
comparison metric but also remember

1132
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:59,519
these motifs are actually matrices and

1133
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:01,879
they represent frequencies of bases at

1134
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,119
each position and not a single

1135
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,559
base so at the end of this I have about

1136
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:10,480
58,000 by 58,000 distance Matrix uh with

1137
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:11,960
all the constrained motifs in Jasper and

1138
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,639
that can be a little hard to visualize

1139
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,240
so I used umap to reduce the

1140
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:19,480
dimensionality and was actually very

1141
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:22,000
pleased to see that they cluster by

1142
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:24,159
class and family according to the Jasper

1143
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,838
labels so that's a good validation that

1144
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:29,118
the alignments actually worked and are

1145
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:30,880
doing something um and so let's see if

1146
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,480
they have some specific binding

1147
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,720
preferences within

1148
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,199
them so I looked in one class in family

1149
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,598
in this case the bip group B's and I

1150
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:44,000
clustered them uh according to their

1151
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,760
motifs and I see that there is this big

1152
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
cluster here that has a Jasper Motif

1153
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,839
within it um but there's also two

1154
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,639
clusters down here the pink and the red

1155
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:55,480
that don't have any annotated Jasper

1156
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:58,159
Motif which is cool suggests some novel

1157
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,760
binding pattern that we haven't seen

1158
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,440
and when we look at the motif

1159
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,640
preferences when each of these clusters

1160
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,599
there are actual differences for example

1161
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:08,679
between the pink and the red there's a

1162
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,480
CA strong CA preference versus a strong

1163
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:14,399
CG preference or a strong uh G

1164
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,679
preference in the red versus a very weak

1165
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,119
t or a preference up up here so

1166
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,719
certainly interesting to see but I'd

1167
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,640
like to get more validation and so I

1168
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:26,439
looked at how these subcluster presence

1169
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:28,799
or absence correlates to expression or

1170
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:31,200
explains expression variation so I'm

1171
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,000
doing a very simple linear model for

1172
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:36,558
this expression uh testing so the Y uh

1173
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,760
values are going to be TPM or

1174
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:41,640
transcripts per million a measure of RNA

1175
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,960
expression log 10 transformed and the X

1176
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:46,879
Matrix is either the presence or absence

1177
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,559
of a motif from that subcluster and it

1178
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,960
is it within 100 KB Upstream of a given

1179
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:53,920
Gene uh which is well within what we

1180
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,079
know CIS regulatory regions are capable

1181
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:00,119
of interacting with uh the core promoter

1182
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:02,359
and so uh I have about 5,000 genes that

1183
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:07,200
have any one of these motifs upstream

1184
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:07,199
and there's about 1,600 uh Motif

1185
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:11,239
subclusters and what I'm going to do is

1186
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,280
for each of these columns for each

1187
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:15,279
subcluster column I'm going to randomly

1188
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,160
permute and measure the change in r s of

1189
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,079
that model and I'm going to do a couple

1190
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:21,239
replicates of permutation and measure

1191
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:24,640
the average change in the models r

1192
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:28,000
squared by permuting that

1193
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:31,159
column and so uh Focus on the right side

1194
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,519
here every row is a replicate RNA seek

1195
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:35,279
experiment and we have multiple

1196
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:37,519
replicates per tissue and generally the

1197
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,720
r squ values don't differ very much

1198
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:44,519
ranging from 0 2 to 3 and along the

1199
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:47,919
x-axis here we have those different 1600

1200
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:50,199
Motif subclusters and I've normalized by

1201
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,559
the r s of each model the Delta so that

1202
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:54,558
we can compare across rows now this can

1203
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,800
be kind of hard to visualize so let's

1204
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:01,079
zoom in just a little bit to the again

1205
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:03,440
the bzip factors and the C c2h2 zinc

1206
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:05,680
finger factors and we can see some cool

1207
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,679
initial patterns so for example we have

1208
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:10,358
this subcluster that seems to explain a

1209
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:12,639
lot of the variation in endosperm uh

1210
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:14,719
tissue expression and it shows up across

1211
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:17,078
both tissue replicates so that's a good

1212
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:20,118
sign we have some subclusters that seem

1213
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:21,480
to show up in anther tissue as well um

1214
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,200
and then some subclusters that don't

1215
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,199
seem to be specific to any tissue in

1216
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:27,199
particular

1217
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:33,000
so for this uh uh section to summarize

1218
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:34,598
I've seen or identified these

1219
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,679
constrained maze transcription Factor

1220
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:39,359
binding sites and they seem to Cluster

1221
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:41,838
into subfamilies that have very specific

1222
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:45,078
binding preferences some of them are not

1223
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:47,440
annotated in known TF databases so novel

1224
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:49,880
motifs and the Upstream presence or

1225
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,880
absence of these constrained subfamilies

1226
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,480
seems to be important to tissue specific

1227
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,480
expression

1228
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:59,358
patterns so to close us off I'm going to

1229
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:00,759
talk about uh just a wonderful

1230
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,639
collaboration with some fine folks at

1231
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,880
the University of Washington where we

1232
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,199
built a core promoter to expression

1233
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,640
model I've talked a big game about these

1234
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,358
models saying that we could use them for

1235
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,799
genome editing but let's prove if they

1236
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:16,199
can actually work or

1237
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,920
not so what Toby and Jackson did in

1238
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:20,558
Christine qu's group is a star SE gas

1239
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,400
and glazing over a lot of the molecular

1240
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,880
biology just you know that you can

1241
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,240
synthesize any 170 base pairs you want

1242
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,079
put it Upstream of a reporter Gene put

1243
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:31,039
it into either tobacco leaf or Maze

1244
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:33,960
protoplast and measure the relative

1245
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:36,838
expression to some baseline and what we

1246
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,720
did in this work was take 170 base pairs

1247
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:41,440
Upstream of the transcription start site

1248
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:44,358
in a rabid opsis Maze and sorghum and

1249
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,679
I'm calling that the core

1250
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:48,960
promoter the good news is star seek is

1251
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:51,639
replicable within the expression system

1252
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,318
so looking across replicates one and two

1253
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:57,639
in tobacco leaf the same promoter agrees

1254
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:59,318
with an R skirt of about 0.91

1255
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:01,838
when we look in the Maze protoplast it's

1256
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:05,159
a little bit less at R square to 79 but

1257
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:07,199
still pretty agreeable across uh

1258
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:09,159
replicates and what I want to emphasize

1259
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:12,159
here is if we start to compare the same

1260
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:15,039
170 base pair promoter across Maze and

1261
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:17,920
tobacco uh systems they only agree with

1262
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:19,679
an R squar of. 31 really emphasizing how

1263
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,039
much of the variation expression depends

1264
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:25,000
on the trans the cellular environment

1265
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:27,639
versus the Cy promoter

1266
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,679
sequence so my contri ution to this work

1267
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:32,920
was building this bidirectional CNN

1268
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,480
model to predict core promoter strength

1269
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,920
so what's bidirectional about is

1270
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,639
typically these convolutional neural

1271
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,119
networks scan along your input sequence

1272
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:41,318
only in One Direction They Don't

1273
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,079
Understand DNA strandedness so a

1274
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:45,079
modification I made was to have the

1275
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,240
model automatically flip the motif into

1276
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:49,960
its reverse complement and scan it along

1277
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:51,838
the other strand all at once so that it

1278
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,240
can use the same kernel to learn both

1279
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:55,920
the forward and the reverse strand

1280
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:57,479
instead of wasting two and that's great

1281
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,200
because it results in a more efficient

1282
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,440
use of parameters which is important if

1283
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:04,598
we're Limited in data

1284
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:07,400
quantity and in one of the most exciting

1285
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:11,119
moments of my PhD we found that these

1286
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:13,519
models actually work so we took both

1287
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,559
three Snips suggested by the model or 10

1288
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,920
Snips suggested by the model and

1289
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:20,200
actually put them into tobacco or Maze

1290
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,400
and show that they increased expression

1291
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:24,439
level significantly and this doesn't

1292
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,838
matter whether you're in tobacco or maze

1293
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:30,318
or if you have a 35s enhancer Upstream

1294
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:33,798
or not it increases expression in all

1295
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:36,039
cases and not only that it the model is

1296
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:39,280
able to predict the degree at which

1297
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:40,838
expression increased so they do seem to

1298
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,000
have the ability if you can control the

1299
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:48,400
trans environment to predict across

1300
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:52,000
different alals uh very closely related

1301
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:54,160
alals so in summary the CNN models seem

1302
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,400
to be highly effective Learners of Cy

1303
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:59,239
promoter variation if you can control

1304
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,519
that trans environment and the suggested

1305
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:03,919
edits from these models actually work in

1306
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,759
planta um and it seems that these could

1307
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,838
be the way towards more efficient uh uh

1308
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:12,520
promoter

1309
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:15,239
bashing so bring us all uh together

1310
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:18,480
again uh the DNA to chromatin model we

1311
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:21,039
saw does work across species and also is

1312
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:25,000
um comparable to within species trained

1313
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:27,239
models so great for the promoter and utr

1314
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,519
uh expression model it does does work

1315
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:31,118
well across species but it still

1316
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:33,079
struggles to predict across different

1317
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,559
orthologues so I'll give it a yes and a

1318
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:37,599
no sort of success

1319
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:39,559
there there's still some more work to be

1320
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,119
done to validate these subclusters in

1321
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:44,400
the transcription Factor binding site uh

1322
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:46,880
work but it's showing some

1323
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,358
interesting patterns between subcluster

1324
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:52,559
presence absence and

1325
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:54,078
expression and finally the core promoter

1326
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,160
expression model not only seemed to

1327
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:59,160
learn the relationship but also then

1328
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:01,118
predict edits that could make changes

1329
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:02,558
and actually those changes reflect what

1330
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,760
the model predicted so I'll give that

1331
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,960
two checks for super

1332
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,799
success um and with that I would just

1333
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,318
like to acknowledge my funding so from

1334
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:15,079
the NSF and the grfp specifically for my

1335
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:18,199
first three years of graduate school and

1336
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:19,480
USDA AR for the rest I've as you can

1337
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:21,279
imagine had to leverage a lot of

1338
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,440
different compute across the years from

1339
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,720
exceed in the TAC cluster uh to the

1340
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,280
front system and more recently on the

1341
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:30,679
USDA sin cluster and bio HBC thank you

1342
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,480
very much of course my committee at Amy

1343
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:36,440
and Eric for your advice and Cornell for

1344
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:38,280
having me I'd also like to thank X for

1345
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,599
just not only giving U making my

1346
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:44,599
internship very valuable experience but

1347
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:46,318
just playing fun um my co-authors which

1348
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:48,640
out whom of course I could have just not

1349
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,719
done this work the bucker lab and

1350
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,798
synapsis for both the support and all

1351
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:55,679
the good times over the

1352
00:51:52,798 --> 00:51:57,280
years and finally thank you to all the

1353
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,558
open source software developers and

1354
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,760
packagers who have probably spent

1355
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:04,400
countless hours making the tools that we

1356
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,160
rely on um and also the packagers for

1357
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,960
making them just easily installable for

1358
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,960
us so with that I'm happy to take your

1359
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:18,119
questions yeah you can go back to your

1360
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:20,639
your p on a slide there yeah so the the

1361
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:23,880
upper right hand corner

1362
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:26,118
is um I guess you you're when you're

1363
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,358
you're trying to predict within or you

1364
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:31,519
can predict the the amount of expression

1365
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:34,279
across orthologs pretty well but not not

1366
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,838
between genes within orthologs right

1367
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,400
yeah so I'll I'll be a little bit more

1368
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,358
precise with my terminology there sorry

1369
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,720
so when I say orthologue in this case

1370
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:44,960
what I mean is across one gene in maze

1371
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:48,000
across different OES in the N population

1372
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:51,199
so not necessarily two paralogs within

1373
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,960
the maze genome so sorry if I was clear

1374
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:57,000
about that and the training that you

1375
00:52:52,960 --> 00:53:01,679
have is the the total expression

1376
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,838
of that Gene across many ortholog right

1377
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,639
uh it is either the max expression of

1378
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:09,279
that orthologue across all tissues that

1379
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:11,960
I have data for or just one single uh

1380
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:17,240
tissue expression value could you could

1381
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:21,960
you try to train on the deviation

1382
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:24,078
within within a within so so for a it's

1383
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,559
deviation from the mean for that Gene

1384
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,200
does that make sense yeah yeah you could

1385
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:28,640
absolutely do that and and pre the

1386
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,318
previous work I didn't highlight what

1387
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,519
they did there but they did exactly that

1388
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:34,159
they they put both orthologue uh

1389
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:36,239
sequences in the model and tried to

1390
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:38,440
predict the expression and it does does

1391
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,479
really like the expression change and it

1392
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,318
does

1393
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:46,639
well but not it doesn't like for example

1394
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:50,400
take a difference in DNA sequence it

1395
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:54,639
takes both in the in the input

1396
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,480
yeah yeah I do know roughly how

1397
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:57,798
differentiated those two orth logs are

1398
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,159
from one

1399
00:53:57,798 --> 00:54:02,960
another yeah why the was bur approach is

1400
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:04,639
is easier than this one no I don't know

1401
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,240
a sequence the sequence number off the

1402
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:10,759
top of my head you know yeah so they're

1403
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:14,558
about 8 million years Toge oh I

1404
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:17,480
see so it's it's that's an easier

1405
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:20,319
problem than this right differentiating

1406
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,519
one snip right causes an expression

1407
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:25,519
difference so in their case orthologs

1408
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:26,920
were across Ma and sorghum um in my case

1409
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:30,119
they're across

1410
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,119
like b73 and mo

1411
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:38,280
17 are there any questions online I

1412
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:38,279
can't really see the chat no

1413
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,880
cool yeah did you look at

1414
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:46,079
transferability across tissues for the

1415
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:49,119
DNA Caron model and model

1416
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,519
transferability across ti so I did show

1417
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,039
like sort of the perform you mean

1418
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:53,920
performance across different tissues

1419
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:57,318
like the single cell work well like if

1420
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,798
you train in Leaf how well does it

1421
00:54:57,318 --> 00:55:00,880
yeah that's a great and if I had the

1422
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:02,920
data set to do that I would have but at

1423
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:06,000
the time I did the model I only had the

1424
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:09,079
leaf accessibility across that vast

1425
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,239
number of species um so no I think it's

1426
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:14,318
an interesting question but I didn't

1427
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:14,318
have the data at the time to test that

1428
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:20,440
yeah

1429
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:24,719
yeah

1430
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:26,000
call she come to my defense now um so

1431
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:28,118
yeah I've just been sort of roughly

1432
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,960
saying core promoter like anywhere from

1433
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:35,000
50 base pairs to 150 base pairs Upstream

1434
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:37,480
promoter is such a wide number I've seen

1435
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:42,039
up to 2,000 base pairs from a Jee be

1436
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:46,280
called the promoter um so yeah it's it's

1437
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:46,280
a very loose term and I'm abusing it

1438
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,000
sorry H sarin I think

1439
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:57,639
yeah yeah

1440
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:07,118
yeah it's I mean it highly varies based

1441
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:08,559
on really genome size so like in a rabid

1442
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,519
opsis things on average are going to be

1443
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,599
a lot closer together than in bigger

1444
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:14,358
genomes like maze where things are

1445
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:17,039
pushed out by a lot of this transposon

1446
00:56:14,358 --> 00:56:19,279
activity over time and So within the

1447
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:23,200
grasses that can tend to have larger

1448
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:26,519
genomes that range can get up to 100 250

1449
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:31,358
KB um on average so it really really

1450
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:31,358
seems to depend on genome size

1451
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:35,680
yeah oh John

1452
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:39,480
Mo

1453
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:42,078
um you you train these models on data

1454
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:45,760
yeah and sometimes it's accessible or

1455
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:48,920
not methylated or not conserved or

1456
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,440
not but but it like you had a comment at

1457
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,639
one point where it seemed like

1458
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:55,880
accessible or not it's actually not

1459
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:58,679
binary in in biology right there's uh

1460
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:01,440
some continuous nature of accessibility

1461
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:04,078
yeah so it's it's a general question

1462
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,760
about statistics maybe of like what do

1463
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:09,400
you gain and what do you lose when you

1464
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,240
convert something that's in some ways

1465
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,400
continuous to something that's binary

1466
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:15,318
for for training a statistical model

1467
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,880
yeah I mean that's a great question and

1468
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:21,000
part of what you what you gain is a high

1469
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:25,838
false positive rate uh but I mean it's

1470
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,838
something that we that's a loss right

1471
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,599
do you like my phrasing

1472
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:36,798
yes um and yeah I so there there's more

1473
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:38,960
as we get more and more single cell data

1474
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:41,318
we can ask that question like train a

1475
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,920
model on the proportion of a given cell

1476
00:57:41,318 --> 00:57:46,358
type that's actually this this peak is

1477
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,240
accessible and in and you know we had

1478
00:57:46,358 --> 00:57:51,318
the data we had at the time and I think

1479
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:54,399
nowadays we can certainly make a more

1480
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:56,759
quantitative uh model for accessibility

1481
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,119
yeah because I totally agree biology is

1482
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:02,240
not in this case your answer suggests

1483
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:06,599
that usually if you convert to Binary

1484
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:11,159
you lose something but I you had a you

1485
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:13,160
had a a a sort of scatter plot where I

1486
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:14,639
think it was also within the promoter to

1487
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:16,279
expression where you said oh maybe it's

1488
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:18,159
overfitting on these things that are

1489
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,599
massively expressed that have massive

1490
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:23,118
fold changes yeah uh and that made me

1491
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,480
think oh why don't you just make that

1492
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:28,680
one binary and then it won't know which

1493
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,240
ones are or yeah have massive bu changes

1494
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:32,879
yeah which that might be a case where

1495
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:34,759
you gain something but maybe I'm wrong I

1496
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:38,240
mean comment no I think that's

1497
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:41,400
interesting and some some potential ways

1498
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:43,399
to think about that is is first training

1499
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,798
a model on pseudogene or not pseo when I

1500
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,599
say pseudogene things that are expressed

1501
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:48,358
or not expressed in any tissue and then

1502
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:50,400
have a model that fine-tune some sort of

1503
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:53,239
expression level so you don't get have

1504
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,519
to learn both any expression all at at

1505
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:58,118
the same time as you're trying to learn

1506
00:58:55,519 --> 00:59:00,920
uh expression fine tune and I think

1507
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:02,480
another problem uh why I emphasize the

1508
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,358
tals is sort of overfitting is because I

1509
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,039
used the mean squared error as my loss

1510
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:10,159
function maybe that's weighted much

1511
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:11,680
higher in my model uh and just learns

1512
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:15,399
that

1513
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:17,919
so thank you yeah sure Sam

1514
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,760
doel

1515
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:24,720
improveing architectures you think it's

1516
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:28,319
problem of data um I think it's a lack

1517
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:31,000
of not only data but sort of well

1518
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:33,639
replicated and controlled data sets I

1519
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,679
mean I tested uh model architectures

1520
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:37,719
that had vastly different orders of

1521
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:40,000
magnitude uh differences and they just

1522
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:42,919
really didn't show much performance

1523
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,599
differences uh so yeah from what the

1524
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:48,039
evidence I've seen I think we just need

1525
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:49,318
better data more controlled data sets

1526
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:51,599
and if someone has a really cool

1527
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:54,358
architecture they proposes the best and

1528
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:56,720
tests against that data set just like we

1529
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:58,558
have these uh Casp comp competitions for

1530
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:00,358
protein folding and that's how we knew

1531
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,960
Alpha fold was one of the best

1532
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:04,358
performers because it didn't see any of

1533
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,318
the data beforehand so I think having

1534
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:07,838
these sort of

1535
01:00:05,318 --> 01:00:11,038
holdout uh well curated data sets is

1536
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:13,838
really essential moving forward

1537
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:16,920
so Travis I was wondering when you're

1538
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:18,920
fitting your uh transcription Factor

1539
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,880
binding site models you're only using at

1540
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:24,519
the end 5,000 genes why why is that

1541
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:27,039
rather than like the 20,000 or 25,000

1542
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:28,960
genes yeah so good question in this case

1543
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:32,200
I only I only chose genes that had at

1544
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:34,559
least one motif of the subclusters that

1545
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:36,719
I identified Upstream I could just I

1546
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,280
could certainly add in the other 20,000

1547
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:39,719
that don't have any but there would be a

1548
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:43,200
lot of

1549
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:45,159
zeros so there was that many gen without

1550
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:48,919
a without a

1551
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:51,838
constrained Motif uh that I could detect

1552
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,838
with my msas

1553
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:56,719
Yeah question

1554
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:04,679
okay asking more

1555
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:07,318
questions well thank you very

1556
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:10,199
much this has been a production of

1557
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:13,199
