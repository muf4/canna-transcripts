1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,798
University thank you very much for the

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:15,718
intro and for the welcome I'm happy to

4
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:17,800
be here um and partly because I've been

5
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,000
kind of a sap about uh being back on

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,760
campus after quite a few years and um

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,640
yeah it's it's beautiful to be here um

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,279
so you know originally I came to study

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,640
uh mechanical and aerospace engineering

10
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,599
and I was hoping to study under Carl

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,799
Sean but uh that didn't work out uh

12
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:36,519
exactly and then um but I did get to

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,199
work with Steve Squire and space

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,000
Sciences on some of the early Mars Mars

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,840
Rover development work there and uh so

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,119
uh then so coming from that you know

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
Aerospace robotics angle ended up

18
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,119
working on all these tools it had to do

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,960
with soils and rocks uh like the

20
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:56,119
grinding tool on the Mars rover spirit

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,280
and opportunity I got to help design and

22
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:00,358
build that and and operate it uh when it

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,399
was on Mars uh it actually one of them

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,519
still working on Mars now um and that

25
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,719
was all because of the Cornell

26
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,080
connections here and um and then after a

27
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,079
while I thought uh so I was at a private

28
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,039
company where we built that for the the

29
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,079
Rover missions uh called honeybee

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,159
robotics in New York City then after a

31
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,519
while I thought it'd be nice to maybe

32
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,439
take a break from all that uh rocks and

33
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:25,798
dirt uh basically you know and I figured

34
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:28,879
I'd go to Carnegie melon to do robotics

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,560
robotic vehicle development work and uh

36
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,280
my adviser told me you know once I was

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,478
there you know about this it's exciting

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,599
Mars you know like a lunar rover project

39
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:39,280
to De develop a new lunar rover and then

40
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,199
he told me what the task was it was to

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,320
to support drilling down into the soils

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,560
um so uh I started to wonder if this was

43
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,839
a thread in my career that I was kind of

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,920
inescapable uh and

45
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,759
then uh later ended up um here now at

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,079
this near Earth autonomy which is a

47
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,759
spin-off company from Carnegie melon uh

48
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:04,519
from the field robotic Center and um now

49
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,438
you know my major project at the moment

50
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,318
is this agriculture project and so we

51
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,878
end up with a lot of this data where

52
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:15,199
we're making these aerial observations

53
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:17,679
on on the crops and and of the soils so

54
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,759
the the thread continues and um I'm

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,439
embracing it I think I it's great to be

56
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,519
in the field I think um the other more

57
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,680
uh the more important threat I think is

58
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,599
that uh I've enjoyed getting to work on

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,400
systems that are collecting data for

60
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:37,000
some scientists to make progress um in

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,280
their areas so um the this Terra program

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,719
uh is has been a great project for us in

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,000
our company to get deeper into the the

64
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:50,120
support of Agriculture um uh from an

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,080
aerial sensing kind of

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,719
angle um so I think just to give you bit

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,719
more of a just a picture of uh what

68
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,800
we're doing this teror program is you

69
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,799
know it's led by Steve C he's the pi on

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,599
our project at Clemson um we are the

71
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,920
team providing the aerial data

72
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,839
collection and some of the analysis from

73
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,119
there there's also a team at um at

74
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,239
Carnegie melon doing ground Vehicles so

75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,840
that robotic uh Vehicles driving through

76
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,319
the crops uh collecting data up close to

77
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,878
the crops um so combining these these

78
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:27,878
data collection platforms uh uh outputs

79
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:30,000
and um learning more about ways to

80
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:33,639
accelerate the breeding process so this

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,280
is one of the fields there these um

82
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,878
these exquisitely planted fields in

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,799
South Carolina outside of Clemson uh

84
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:43,318
seeing hundreds of of varieties of

85
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,519
energy sorghum in this one two acre

86
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:48,238
field and so we're you know while at

87
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,360
this point I think one of the ground

88
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,878
Vehicles was driving uh making

89
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,439
observations um on the ground while

90
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,598
we're flying over

91
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:01,000
um and I hope the two screens doesn't

92
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:04,919
make anyone uh MO

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,680
sick um even one screen might be enough

94
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,919
um so you can see a lot of variation in

95
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,560
the in the fields you know this is

96
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:14,119
definitely not a typical farm right when

97
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,600
you're looking at breeding plots um they

98
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,840
there are a lot of different uh traits

99
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,799
in these different varieties um this is

100
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,359
early this is a first year out of three

101
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:26,599
for this project um so we're we're

102
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,840
starting to we're looking at some of the

103
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,840
uh early refinements of the breeding and

104
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,119
um and refinements of the the data

105
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:37,679
collection

106
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,240
techniques um so they have two fields in

107
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,560
South Carolina one's in uh is right

108
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,960
outside of Clemson and the other is in

109
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,079
in Florence uh so it's more this you can

110
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:51,000
see this like reddish clay soil um and

111
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,399
uh the Florence side is more coastal

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,959
plains very Sandy um so it's nice to be

113
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,959
working the two different conditions um

114
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,240
so down for a landing so just for a

115
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,280
little bit of background on on the

116
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,199
company I'm at now it's we're about 40

117
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,000
people it's about four years old uh

118
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,000
we're a spin-off from carnegy melon

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
field robotics Center uh you can think

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,478
of us as kind of this uh the convergence

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,478
of the standard Aviation where you know

122
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,038
just basically uh flying it's it's good

123
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:26,800
technology of course but it's fairly

124
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,599
simple navigation usually flying

125
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,160
waypoints straight straight flight

126
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,360
fairly straightforward um converging

127
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,479
that with more of all the kind of

128
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,960
intelligence that you're seeing more and

129
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,560
more on driverless cars uh the Fiel

130
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:41,478
robotic Center is actually a place that

131
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,280
that uh put out a lot of the people who

132
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:46,318
are at now at at Uber and at Google

133
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,239
developing these drivers's cars that

134
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,840
came out of this the DARPA Grand

135
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,720
challenges um for for these vehicles so

136
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,318
um so our group is a lot of researchers

137
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,880
that came from from that area and uh so

138
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,000
we're converging into this this kind of

139
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,680
this near thought autonomy so basically

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,079
the the company began where it's more

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,400
focused on the navigation helping

142
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,879
aircraft fly on their own down near the

143
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,399
ground where it's

144
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,079
difficult uh so we work in in the field

145
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:16,399
a lot you know we work on a lot of

146
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:18,959
different you know sizes of helicopters

147
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,478
um this is kind of a cool shot flying up

148
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:25,079
over Pittsburgh um one of the seeing one

149
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:27,079
of the rivers and downtown um this is

150
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,639
actually an autonomous flight with a

151
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,478
fulls scale helicopter there in the

152
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,560
upper left uh and you know fly in a lot

153
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,240
of different conditions even out we're

154
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,319
flying out over Lake Erie lately uh

155
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,478
helping a helicopter land onto a onto a

156
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,039
barge uh to show that we could operate

157
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:46,399
from ships so yeah we work with full

158
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,478
scale helicopters um and also kind of

159
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,239
getting into the more and more where I'm

160
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,000
focusing on the mapping and inspection

161
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,840
kind of work is is in these uh the

162
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,199
smaller kind of the 50 lbs and less kind

163
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:00,279
of the um the that kind of category of

164
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,478
aircraft with their um you know like

165
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,478
these quadcopters and hexacopters that

166
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,639
kind of stuff now they're the technolog

167
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,560
is really improving they're easier to

168
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,000
use and now their the FAA is allowed

169
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,839
them to be used commercially um uh more

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,598
and more so it's all it's all working

171
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,159
together to become actually available

172
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:22,560
and so that's kind of the where we're

173
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,639
working in uh for our agricultur work so

174
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,680
far so as a company we're working a lot

175
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,639
in navigation uh and mapping and

176
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,160
inspection those kind of the three kind

177
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,800
of categories

178
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,960
um I think we have kind of in our in our

179
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,160
genes as a company um this you know

180
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,839
history in agriculture there was a

181
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,400
fairly big project USDA funded uh years

182
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,359
ago where some of the founders were uh

183
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:48,120
were working on um with specialty crops

184
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,240
uh this is all ground vehicle based um

185
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,280
but making observations in the field

186
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,158
with specialty crops and uh with

187
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:58,318
nurseries and and Landscape industry

188
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,680
um and so that's actually the

189
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,240
connections I think with with Marcel uh

190
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,519
to

191
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,519
Steve um and so now our current work is

192
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,680
um we're focused on this accelerated

193
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,399
plant breeding uh using the aerial

194
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,360
reconnaissance essentially to help the

195
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:17,679
breeding process and also uh trying to

196
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,158
spin that off into more of farm

197
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,478
management uh helping Growers um and so

198
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:24,560
you could see you could imagine we're

199
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:26,079
we're kind of working with the kind of

200
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,478
early adopters at this point kind of

201
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,680
breeding groups that are that are fairly

202
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,759
high-tech um think of them you know who

203
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,080
function that way uh and also some of

204
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:38,399
the maybe uh larger Growers that would

205
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,800
be open to adopting this kind of stuff

206
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,519
early mostly we working with with energy

207
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,919
sorghum uh but we're also looking some

208
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:50,200
at Maze and uh and

209
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:52,039
grapes um so this boost is our our team

210
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,440
it's our project under the Terra program

211
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:56,480
there there are six different Terra

212
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,079
projects um and so it's it's the

213
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,440
department of Energy's u arpa e it's

214
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:05,000
like it's there their DARPA for energy

215
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,800
applications uh and so I think it's a

216
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,799
fantastic program um the goal for Tera

217
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:13,879
as a whole is um to support you know to

218
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:16,159
basically accelerate uh to this breeding

219
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,039
process to get this really good

220
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:21,919
potential of of energy sorghum as a

221
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:23,799
sustainable biofuel Source um and also

222
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,439
along the way develop new techniques for

223
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:27,559
for breeding for Accelerated breeding

224
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,680
for and and looking at high throughput

225
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:32,278
phenotyping in the field as the as the

226
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,519
main kind of method for that so we're

227
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:35,200
looking into you're basically trying to

228
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,078
support this development of predictive

229
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,240
algorithms you know you get data early

230
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:41,439
in a growing season and predict the the

231
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,680
the you know Harvest kind of results U

232
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,279
be able to assess a variety really early

233
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:49,559
um and then just get get more these

234
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,480
detailed measurements of the the plant

235
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:54,599
physiology and uh then focusing a lot on

236
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,600
the data analytics and connecting the

237
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,240
the the genotypes to phenotypes that

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,200
kind of mapping

239
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,079
um so I don't know if this this might

240
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,759
give you motion sickness too potentially

241
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,319
but it's we're trying you can imagine

242
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,159
that we're this first theme we're

243
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,000
essentially developing these pH

244
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,559
phenotyping hardware systems getting

245
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,720
them into the field so that they can

246
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,719
collect data um both on the ground and

247
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,120
in the air uh taking these results and

248
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,399
putting them in through an analysis

249
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,278
pipeline including machine learning

250
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,360
techniques uh and then uh doing this

251
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,200
phenotype to genotype mapping um and

252
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,720
feeding that all back into the field so

253
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,480
that we you know we have three growing

254
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,079
Seasons to work so this cycle uh goes uh

255
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,839
throughout the

256
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,599
project um so just thinking about our

257
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,480
activity in the field for this program

258
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,480
we've got um these ground Vehicles by

259
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,399
that carneg melon are making um they're

260
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,120
driving through the roads uh getting uh

261
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,399
doing able to do this close proximity

262
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,839
kind of sensing you know you're you're

263
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,278
right up against the plants they're

264
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,279
doing stereo vision lar other sensor

265
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,480
types um then they're also doing things

266
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,879
that are contact sensing which I think

267
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,320
is pretty novel um where they're

268
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:13,439
actually interacting physically with the

269
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,278
plant um you know measuring uh one thing

270
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,000
they're focusing on right now is a

271
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,320
penetrometer testing on the strength of

272
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,120
the stocks so it actually has a gripper

273
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,639
that visually you know automatically

274
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,440
finds a stock grabs it and does a

275
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,079
penetrometer test um and as it goes

276
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,279
through the rows and then um there's

277
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:36,519
also a sensing Network for environmental

278
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,078
uh characteristics on the ground and

279
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,360
then we the we're the team that's doing

280
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:43,479
that the aerial sensing um so yeah we're

281
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,240
we've got this uh this aircraft flying

282
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,399
overhead you know 40 to 60 ft kind of

283
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,278
above the ground um doing mapping of the

284
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,559
whole field um with a custom sensor

285
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,078
package so that's that's the bulk of our

286
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,078
work is developing this custom sensor

287
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,919
package we don't develop the aircraft we

288
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,838
don't develop sensors we we choose

289
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,519
aircraft for the for the purpose and we

290
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,639
choose the sensors for the purpose and

291
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,200
integrate uh and then work with that

292
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,240
data make sure the data can be fused

293
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,920
well it's registered well spatially it's

294
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,839
calibrated well in terms of

295
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:18,319
energetics uh and bring that data

296
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,079
together and make it make it useful so

297
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,800
this is a picture of our um our first

298
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,399
sensor package for this project um it

299
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,799
ended up kind of looking like a micro

300
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,799
satellite or something this is about six

301
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,000
or seven pounds you you could hold it in

302
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:36,240
your hands like this um and it it rides

303
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,039
on board the aircraft and is completely

304
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,720
self-contained black box like you

305
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,559
essentially like a very tricked out

306
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,920
GoPro you know you hit start it records

307
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,479
from all of its six

308
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:51,719
sensors and then uh also simultaneously

309
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,839
um it uh is estimating its position and

310
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,879
and orientation in the world as it goes

311
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,839
so that way we're not just taking it's

312
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,559
not just flying over with a camera and

313
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,959
then stitching together imagery later

314
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:06,119
that's fairly straightforward um it's

315
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,919
actually uh it estimates the where the

316
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,240
sensor package is and how it's how it's

317
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:14,719
pointing so that you can uh pull

318
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:17,120
together uh really explicitly mapped uh

319
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,480
so every pixel you know exactly where it

320
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,198
hits on the ground um and so you can

321
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,959
make this very accurate uh very accurate

322
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:27,039
Maps um thre dimensionally in some

323
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,599
cases so

324
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,719
um these are the aircraft we're working

325
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,480
with uh this is a a 35 lb uh electric

326
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,399
autonomous helicopter on the left um and

327
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,839
then this is a similar weight um there's

328
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,320
a hexacopter that we're using now um so

329
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,720
we're kind of showing both you know

330
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,560
they're different categories in terms of

331
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,278
cost and uh complexity um and also

332
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,159
performance in some ways the helicopter

333
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:54,559
can get a lot more coverage over larger

334
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,838
Fields faster flying more wind

335
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,559
conditions um but the hexacopter is

336
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:02,079
really easy to use uh uh um and so you

337
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,838
know we're I think most of the time

338
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:08,719
we'll be operating from that but

339
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,399
um so we we Tred to start kind of from

340
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,600
you know first principles in a way on

341
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,159
deciding what was going to be in that

342
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,360
sensor package um

343
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:20,278
so we ended up uh going through that

344
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:24,000
that process ended up with these uh four

345
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,838
sensing modes um so one for to try to

346
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,039
get at the shape of the crops uh kind

347
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,720
geometric properties we're experimenting

348
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:33,000
with Lar so it's you know it's laser

349
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,399
scanner there that that disc kind of

350
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,440
Puck shaped h in the front um so it's

351
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,720
scanning across the ground with with uh

352
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,040
infrared laser points and building up a

353
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,160
3D Cloud um and then to get at kind of

354
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,799
color properties and and also geometric

355
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:50,159
properties uh we're using visible

356
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,919
Imaging just standard RGB Imaging uh to

357
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,278
to look at temperature related

358
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:59,039
properties and uh some stress uh plant

359
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,759
stress using the thermal infrared so

360
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,799
that's just monochromatic long wave

361
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:06,039
infrared and then uh to be a little more

362
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:10,639
ambitious uh we also added in

363
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:12,838
hyperspectral camera so um you know with

364
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,039
typical camera you think of color it's

365
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,160
three three bands right red green blue

366
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,559
the you could think of them as three

367
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,240
separate layers um if you really look at

368
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,719
the sensor on a color camera it's

369
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,519
actually red green blue and then another

370
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,800
green it's a pattern of four for every

371
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,839
thing if you think of as one pixel uh

372
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,159
and so so you know you're getting those

373
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,680
three uh separate bands for hypers

374
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,919
spectral we're using a camera that has

375
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,359
100 spectral bands and they're all

376
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,838
they're not overlapping at all they're

377
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,318
all separate uh very narrow bands uh

378
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:46,639
they're and it's cutting across the kind

379
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:48,919
of uh red end visible and up into the

380
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,919
near infrared through pretty far into

381
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:53,479
the near infrared so um there's going to

382
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,439
be I think there we're taking a lot of

383
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,319
inspiration from the remote sensing

384
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,000
approaches uh from you know satellite uh

385
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:03,919
where they they have all these um

386
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,720
interesting indices where they'll

387
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,360
they'll say this spectral band ratioed

388
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,639
with this spectral band uh ends up

389
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,959
correlating really well with this kind

390
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,759
of plant property and so uh and so there

391
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,359
we're thinking that through this whole

392
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,079
combination hypers Spectrum particular I

393
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,199
think we're going to get to explore and

394
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:20,078
look for these properties these

395
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:23,240
predictive things these uh correlations

396
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:25,919
to plant properties and um and be able

397
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,278
to I think we'll learn quite a bit and

398
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,879
then also get to do a second generation

399
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,399
in the second year year of this payload

400
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:35,159
where of the sensor Suite where it'll be

401
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:39,839
more refined and uh and a bit a bit

402
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,838
cheaper too uh so be closer to being

403
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:46,519
commercialized so here's a shot of us um

404
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,039
it's in the field this is the sandier

405
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,600
site there um uh in South Carolina uh

406
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,838
and there's the sensor package Riding

407
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,040
Down Below on one of the multi-rotor

408
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,199
copter so it's pretty straightforward it

409
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:04,438
takes just a couple people to operate in

410
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:09,279
the field takes off and um and collects

411
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:10,720
data all along lands we uh here's a shot

412
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:15,399
of us

413
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,400
um I think it was last month

414
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:27,867
[Music]

415
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,960
I would lower the volume but I don't

416
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,798
know

417
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,038
how I

418
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:43,119
tried um so you can see it's just it

419
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,279
takes off uh it's really simple to

420
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,719
operate this thing even though it's it's

421
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:46,960
a pretty serious aircraft in a way I

422
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,240
mean it's still you you have to be very

423
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,160
careful we're following all the fa

424
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,640
regulations we have registered Pilots

425
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,080
like the guy who's actually piloting

426
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,640
this he manually made it takeoff and

427
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,319
then flipped it into autonomous mode for

428
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,919
it to do its kind of simple lawn kind of

429
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:04,720
pattern over the crops U but he he used

430
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:06,799
to fly Apache helicopters for a long

431
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,558
time in um South Korea

432
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:13,038
so that's him there Spencer so he's kind

433
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:16,109
of unfaced by this stuff

434
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:27,509
luckily um

435
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:27,509
[Music]

436
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,400
so yeah the the flying portions is easy

437
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,240
you know it's just just as long as you

438
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,000
follow all the right procedures and keep

439
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,599
everything legal and safe it's all very

440
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,359
straightforward stuff it's not novel

441
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:44,079
technology there it's off the shelf um

442
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:47,119
but so it all the all our focus is in

443
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:50,038
the uh in making the sensor Suite

444
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:52,558
correct and uh making the data

445
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:54,960
worthwhile so here's just um series of

446
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:58,079
frames just of what this so it's all

447
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,038
straight down looking cameras um this is

448
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:03,599
just some of the visible data from you

449
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:07,279
know from the RGB

450
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:09,879
camera um and then just an example of

451
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,960
what some of that looks like once you uh

452
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,280
start to build these orthographic maps

453
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,440
from from the imagery to get a sense of

454
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,000
uh kind of resolutions we're getting

455
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,840
this was flying a little on the high

456
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,200
side about 60 ft above ground level um I

457
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:29,119
was showing Steve some of the the Weeds

458
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,759
on this shot um and then just you know

459
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,319
better sense zooming in so you're

460
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:35,759
getting many pixels across a leaf you

461
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:37,678
know that kind of a spatial resolution

462
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,599
uh seeing color variation seeing texture

463
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,519
in the Pentacles of these uh these sorum

464
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,719
plants U most of the time we're flying

465
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:48,558
over energy sorum so the Pentacles

466
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,400
aren't there uh but um in some cases we

467
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,440
are you're also seeing uh you we will be

468
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,280
able to be pulling out information about

469
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,279
the leaf geometries we're also seeing

470
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,399
some lodging here as an example I think

471
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:02,879
that's something we could probably pull

472
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,400
out um a

473
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,400
automatically

474
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,600
um and so then uh another data product

475
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,240
is this the lar data so this is this

476
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:13,319
point Cloud that we get this isn't

477
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,519
cleaned up or anything it's just

478
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:20,158
basically what it sees as it's flying um

479
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,359
and so it's just a a real 3D model it's

480
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,120
like flying around in a in a strange

481
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:26,599
video game afterwards right you just um

482
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,918
it's you can actually take measurements

483
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,959
between points um you can so you're

484
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,679
essentially able to just after the fact

485
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,480
go through and measure uh geometric

486
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:41,080
properties um so uh so later you get

487
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:45,919
this this 3D model that you can you know

488
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:48,359
spin around um map in different ways uh

489
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,640
process in different ways and get the 3D

490
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:54,038
information so those are some Vans

491
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,799
vehicles and Tents uh here in that big

492
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:57,839
open

493
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,720
aisle and so you're seeing a lot of the

494
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,359
color variation is it's it's a color

495
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,400
scale is applied just to visualize the

496
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,678
differences in Heights so it's it's like

497
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,759
a heat map for uh for height so you're

498
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,360
seeing all the you know a lot of these

499
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:11,960
plots you clearly are different

500
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:14,678
varieties um and so you're seeing fair

501
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,440
amount of variation in the in the height

502
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:19,360
by

503
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,519
plot um that's actually uh one of the

504
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,240
the pherotype that we're focusing on

505
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,879
these last couple weeks is is cleaning

506
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,480
up a uh a way to produce um a good

507
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,278
measurement of plant height uh averaged

508
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,038
out by plot um so this data kind of

509
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:35,440
lends itself to that to be able to know

510
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:37,440
what your kind of characteristic height

511
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,000
is for each plot and the amount of

512
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,960
variation in height in that plot um and

513
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,960
getting more and more appreciation for

514
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,679
how it sounds easy but isn't easy you

515
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,558
know just the idea of I I heard the

516
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,120
story of Steve covich told us the story

517
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:55,839
of a group with um there were I think

518
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:57,839
maybe six um pretty uh respected you

519
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,199
know faculty members on this one program

520
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,639
NSF program and uh multiple of them were

521
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,679
in the National Academy of Sciences and

522
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,240
it took them months to argue out how to

523
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,919
measure the height of the plant and um

524
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,759
now I understand that a little bit

525
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,520
better uh the idea of you know if it has

526
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:13,960
a panicle or not does that influence

527
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:15,879
your height measurement is the leaf is a

528
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,079
leaf pointing up or down does that mean

529
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,039
the plant is a different height um is it

530
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:24,119
is the wind blowing things

531
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:25,879
uh you know what's your me what's your

532
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,839
standard method how a person would do it

533
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,120
versus what can you actually do from

534
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,079
from the air

535
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:34,199
so um this is I think we're you know

536
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,879
getting more and more appreciation for

537
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,440
uh for some of these things with the

538
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,919
sensitivities um so here's just a just

539
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,519
another shot of the the light R Point

540
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,200
Cloud these are the the Vans there in

541
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:50,480
the in the top for scale

542
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,840
um so as we fly we're registering the

543
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,440
data using GPS and inertial sensing um

544
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,199
within the payload it's completely

545
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,600
separate it just is along for the ride

546
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,919
on the aircraft it's not Interactive

547
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:03,558
with the uh the aircraft controls U

548
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:06,120
we're also experimenting with um uh

549
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:09,000
Targets on the ground to help uh tighten

550
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,038
up the spatial registration even more on

551
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,278
the calibration there's um you know we

552
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:14,240
work to some extent with what the

553
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:17,000
manufacturers give us as far as man the

554
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,679
calibration of cameras but then um we're

555
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,679
also doing our own quite a bit in some

556
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:23,038
ways we're redoing and improving things

557
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,720
that the manufacturers do uh especially

558
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:28,079
for the energetics um on like the

559
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,960
hyperspectral camera uh we're doing

560
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,918
things where we

561
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,000
give different light source inputs um

562
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,360
put and then so doing lab calibration

563
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,679
then also field calibration laying out

564
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,599
tarps in the field um taking off and

565
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,360
Landing from a a calibration Target more

566
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:46,879
or less uh and then we're experimenting

567
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:48,678
some with the um uh with shadowing too

568
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,880
the intent there is just to make sure

569
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:54,000
that the data has is closely tied to the

570
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,720
real physics of the plant There's real

571
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,798
plant properties and aren't influenced

572
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,440
by Too Much by the changes in in in

573
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:04,000
lighting conditions which can be pretty

574
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,720
significant it would be like you know

575
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,558
like if you with photography right if

576
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,480
you're messing around with uh different

577
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:11,240
white balances you can imagine it being

578
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,200
very different and that's just trying to

579
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,400
make things look appropriate if you're

580
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,480
trying to make physical deductions then

581
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,519
uh it's even more

582
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,480
important so um with our our analytics

583
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,519
kind of support uh We've we've got these

584
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,319
kind foundational things um ways of

585
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,359
modeling what the ground shape is and

586
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:34,000
segmenting into plots and annotating

587
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,879
things um producing these raw data

588
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,960
products like just you know just the

589
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,679
standard things that are collected right

590
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,278
off the camera um and then these reduced

591
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,880
products these you know image Maps uh 3D

592
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:46,278
models uh and then these more of derived

593
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,440
data products is where we're starting to

594
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,759
put more focus into now things where

595
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,880
it's like like phenotypes you know plant

596
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:57,038
traits Trends in these plant traits um

597
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,679
and then uh we'll be supporting the the

598
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:02,278
rest of the team uh at Clemson where

599
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,320
Steve covich's team is and um the Dan

600
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:07,679
forth Center where where they'll both be

601
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,879
doing uh a lot of the the effort of

602
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,440
making correlations between um the

603
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,520
phenotypes and and genotypes and feeding

604
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,320
that into the breeding

605
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,918
process

606
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:21,278
um so I think

607
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,880
I yeah I describe those fairly well I

608
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,359
think just to get a sense of some of the

609
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,080
other um phenotypes we're going after

610
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,918
things like show you know observing

611
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,759
being able to map out when when

612
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,759
emergence happens where um across the

613
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:39,038
field uh measuring the plant height per

614
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,960
plot uh and then um that how that

615
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,079
changes over time whether or not there's

616
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,360
a

617
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:49,199
panicle uh so the uh and things like

618
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,639
canopy closure Leaf area index um

619
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,840
lodging you know if the plants have

620
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,559
fallen over just other geometric types

621
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:57,359
of things uh other stress like water

622
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:02,038
stress or nitrogen stress or Leaf

623
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:03,319
necrosis um and uh anything we can learn

624
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:05,359
about you know the photosynthetic

625
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,200
activity I think from our hyperspectral

626
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,278
uh camera we hope to be able to pick

627
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,600
that up pretty well um and other

628
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:14,640
hyperspectral indices that could maybe

629
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,839
have novel correlations that will'll

630
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,559
find in this

631
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:21,918
project um so in the end I think you

632
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:23,759
know once these become more refined um

633
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,799
you know the hope is that we're giving

634
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:31,038
advice to breeders um uh feeding into

635
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:34,079
their their analysis chains um and

636
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:36,319
advice for for Growers too um you know

637
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,879
how to how to better manage their their

638
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:42,599
fields um and so that they're they're

639
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,159
not just given you know like say on

640
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:47,079
earlier this week we had our people were

641
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:49,799
in the field in South Carolina they came

642
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:53,319
back with 1.3 terabytes and they only

643
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:55,558
flew I think six times and so you know a

644
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:58,599
grower doesn't want that you know that

645
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:59,839
might a lot of us you know just be kind

646
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:01,839
of Blown Away by that it's just not

647
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,480
useful um I think Steve and I were

648
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,278
talking you know they're busy already

649
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,440
you know they're not looking for a a

650
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,759
boring hobby on top of their job so um

651
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,159
we're we're trying to refine this

652
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,759
software process so that they're given

653
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,880
something that's more like actionable

654
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:18,440
intelligence to use U ter from that

655
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,120
World um so it's just basically what do

656
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:25,960
I do give me advice

657
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:27,158
um and so the rpu program Tera is really

658
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,480
consciously pushing us to think about

659
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,278
commercialization um we've kind of

660
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,319
identified a lot of different potential

661
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,278
ways that that things could go we could

662
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:38,798
transition this technology to Market um

663
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:40,359
in the end um you know we're collecting

664
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,200
a huge amount of just of data in the

665
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:45,479
field I think that could be valuable

666
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,600
just the straight data um the anal

667
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:52,079
analysis algorithms uh could potentially

668
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:54,599
be licensable um the the vehicles and

669
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,119
the sensing packages uh and then also

670
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,719
you can imagine the whole integrated

671
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:01,719
phenotyping system of ground and Air and

672
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,600
Analysis um and then I think we could

673
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,960
very well make significant progress um

674
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:10,319
on actual you know new more refined

675
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,440
varieties of energy sorum throughout

676
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:15,759
this

677
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,360
project so I think uh looking ahead a

678
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:21,000
bit um we're hoping to you know extend

679
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:23,759
the work uh onto other Target crops you

680
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,599
know a lot of our sensor approaches and

681
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:30,319
Analysis approaches aren't um you know

682
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,519
completely specialized to energy sorum

683
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:35,599
you know they could easily be applied to

684
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:40,759
other other crop types um or you know

685
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:44,240
even other other areas um uh uh Beyond

686
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:47,319
specific crops um like surveying for um

687
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,880
you know disease in in natural uh you

688
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:52,398
know in trees um that's something that

689
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,600
has been coming up in in Pennsylvania

690
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,719
area lately in discussions um so we're

691
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,079
hoping we're trying to line up more

692
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,640
field trials with uh kind of large farms

693
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:03,439
and um smaller Innovative Farms we've

694
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,120
got people in the area you know like

695
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,558
Pittsburgh is such a you know robotics

696
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,518
kind of uh Mecca that you know we get

697
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:12,000
lucky that there's you know a farmer in

698
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,079
the outside of town who's just supports

699
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
our work so we get to operate there a

700
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:19,759
lot work with his on his crops um and so

701
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,480
it's a nice example of that we're going

702
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,879
to be doing some breeding trials um in

703
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,360
Australia and trying to find a way to

704
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,960
stay active during the the winter here

705
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,278
uh so that we'll be

706
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,519
there in uh outside of Melbourne um this

707
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:37,960
winter so um I think some good

708
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,640
potentials there and then uh so this is

709
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,880
a three-year program uh with terara uh

710
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,120
and so we're hoping to continue that too

711
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,200
there's some potential there once some

712
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:51,839
if some uh funding matching happens uh

713
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,960
so that could continue the work make it

714
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:57,759
more refined uh maybe taking some

715
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,759
different different directions

716
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,720
so um yeah I think it'd be be great to

717
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,558
have if anybody had any questions uh be

718
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,720
happy to answer

719
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,798
those thank you very much Paul for

720
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,919
offering uh any questions I have a

721
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:17,879
question uh I noticed on the uh the fly

722
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,759
flyover that you showed us it was a

723
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:25,080
overcast day does it matter do you

724
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:27,440
prefer overcast versus sunny or um

725
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:29,119
better yeah I overcast is nice actually

726
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,919
it's uh ends up with much more diffused

727
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,119
light less shadowing um yeah it's kind

728
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,559
of like I guess like doing photography

729
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:39,918
it's counterintuitive um maybe um but

730
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:41,960
yeah yeah um we don't really we're

731
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,240
trying to just get the the processes

732
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,880
right so that we can deal with either

733
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,079
conditions you know with u but but

734
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,919
shadowing is is hard to work with you

735
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,000
know uh the idea if you want to see down

736
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,240
into the into the crops not just the top

737
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,558
layer um then it gets tricky it can it

738
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,200
can muddy things for sure um just you

739
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:02,678
know but dynamic range issues you know

740
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,960
that like a very well lit um leaves in

741
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:05,759
portions of the plant in some part of

742
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,798
the scene and then very low Lighting on

743
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:11,079
other portions it's hard to get useful

744
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:15,240
data across the whole range

745
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:18,199
yeah you do the you get a sense of the

746
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,480
instrument package you're fing over do

747
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,278
you are you able to focus on particular

748
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:29,759
quite small parts get data from those

749
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:29,759
for example exclud soil for example

750
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,759
right yeah so as far as the data

751
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:39,440
collection goes we are just covering the

752
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,079
entire field and um and we do it from

753
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,720
two different directions so we'll we'll

754
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,000
cover it say like east to west and then

755
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,519
go back again north to south um and so

756
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,798
you get um a fair amount of you get very

757
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:51,558
complete coverage and then you get a

758
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:53,519
fair amount of uh kind of penetrating

759
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:55,879
observations like down through

760
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,599
especially you know early in midseason

761
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,480
uh down to the soils and lower portions

762
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:03,759
of the plants um and then yeah with the

763
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,399
analysis um I think separating out soils

764
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,798
from from plant material is is a fairly

765
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:12,079
I think pretty straightforward uh thing

766
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:14,240
that we'll be we'll be doing soon um and

767
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,278
then I it's it's hard to say how far

768
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,120
we'll get to go with breaking out uh

769
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:20,038
automat in an automated automated sort

770
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:22,638
of way um different portions of the

771
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:25,440
plant but um My Hope Is that we could at

772
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:28,119
least pick out panicle and leaves

773
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,480
separate of the rest of the scene

774
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:32,479
your thermal

775
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,480
iming

776
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:39,319
temperature so how would you do that one

777
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:42,519
instrument way do you use right uh yeah

778
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:44,439
so that's a um it's a it's fairly low

779
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:47,159
resolution you know it's an imager from

780
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,919
Fleer uh company called Fleer it's so

781
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:53,639
it's um it's about 640 uh pixels across

782
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:55,720
um and it's so that's just because of

783
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,319
the State ofthe art you know with color

784
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,278
Imaging you can we have a 12 megapixel

785
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:01,240
camera on board bo uh but this was a you

786
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:04,159
know 1 megapixel camera just cuz that's

787
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,440
kind of the top of what's available

788
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,200
right now um and luckily a lot of the

789
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,880
thermal thermal properties in the field

790
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:14,278
are are fairly coarse spatially speaking

791
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,679
they're fairly coarse things so um I

792
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:20,119
think it it's still useful um and so I

793
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,519
think early on it might you know say

794
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:24,119
early in the season it might be a little

795
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,159
bit muddy where you know pixels are uh

796
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:28,439
overlapping a lot with you know some

797
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,919
it'll be half landing on a leaf and half

798
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,440
on soil but um later on once the canopy

799
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:39,360
starts to close I think it'll be

800
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:43,000
um pretty clean uh sensing of of canopy

801
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,000
kind of thermal emission

802
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,919
guess primary yeah primary yeah I think

803
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,360
we might get to see some in the

804
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:53,360
hyperspectral too um but I we're hoping

805
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:56,359
to see the stress mostly in the thermal

806
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:56,359
yeah

807
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:09,239
we are planning for about once every

808
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,838
four weeks um we we're also on the hook

809
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,959
to show that we could operate more than

810
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:16,199
one time a day you know B do full

811
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,079
coverage of of a fairly large field like

812
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:21,319
a five hectare field uh twice per day so

813
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:22,960
that's that's more of a demonstrate to

814
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,440
arpa that we can do that kind of

815
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,320
coverage but the the the real field you

816
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:32,039
know trips will be there once

817
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,440
essentially once per month um it's it's

818
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:36,759
a bit of I think at some point the you

819
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,679
know it would just be so close together

820
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,359
that there wouldn't be much value um but

821
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,320
uh so that's you know it was kind of

822
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:48,078
roughly chosen um that we should be able

823
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:51,919
to see quite a bit of change uh in in

824
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,599
four weeks um and but you know I think

825
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:56,358
later in the maybe the third season

826
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,599
we're hoping to just uh keep the system

827
00:34:56,358 --> 00:35:00,279
keep keep the the aircraft down there at

828
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:03,000
the field and it could be operated more

829
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,599
frequently than that so yeah we could

830
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,639
experiment some to see if there's more

831
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:11,880
utility and more frequent trips

832
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,879
yeah do you

833
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,920
have right yeah completely and we I

834
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,838
think I'm hoping to talk more about some

835
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,079
soil potential it' be nice to hear hear

836
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:31,000
some advice for me on that I think it's

837
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:33,880
um you know especially when it's large

838
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,920
large areas to to survey it's you know

839
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,680
the aerial approach is seems really good

840
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,240
for that um and um yeah so I think

841
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,239
there's there's a good potential there

842
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,439
and then um yeah we've had some first

843
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:48,118
conversations with some people about

844
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,720
some of the pests uh Pest Management and

845
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:52,318
um so yeah I think it could be I think a

846
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,439
lot of ways I would see we' maybe be

847
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:56,318
observing I think some of we've seen on

848
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,519
the ground you know actually the ground

849
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:59,960
vehicle from is actually seeing aphids

850
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:03,599
in the images you know actually picking

851
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,199
out things able to recognize them um but

852
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,119
uh from us from the aerial point of view

853
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,919
we probably see more of the the effect

854
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,000
on the plant which so be slightly

855
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:15,240
indirect but still I think uh

856
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,239
valuable what

857
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,039
aspects uh we haven't actually been um

858
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,079
considering it in depth yet I think it's

859
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:23,318
I think there's a lot there's good

860
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:26,760
potential for it but um you know we

861
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:29,358
there this you know I think just if to

862
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,119
see changes you know seeing motion of

863
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:35,358
soil you know if there's um the the 3D

864
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,838
data is so good you know from our lar

865
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,679
that I think if you're able to see um

866
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:40,639
any redistributions of soil I think that

867
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,118
could be really good for picking that

868
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:45,118
out over time um we've done stuff where

869
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,440
you could see small changes in a scene

870
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,920
just you know from one flight to the

871
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,960
next that kind of thing um but then also

872
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,920
with the you know picking out things

873
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,639
like color and thermal and um

874
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,599
hyperspectral you might be able to see

875
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,480
other processes that are going on in the

876
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:01,838
soils so

877
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,838
yeah it'd be nice to hear advice on that

878
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:04,838
yeah

879
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,599
yeah that's that's a good question we

880
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,000
yeah you're right we've been focusing on

881
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,599
just this one you know all these

882
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,920
different varieties of of sorghum and um

883
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:43,640
it's more our Focus has been more about

884
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,119
yeah the kind of basic traits uh but um

885
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:46,199
yeah I think actually Steve and I were

886
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,960
talking this morning a little bit about

887
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:50,318
trying to differentiate you know crops

888
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,079
from weeds and so I think uh we were

889
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:55,279
talking about different methods for that

890
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,240
I think um from this you know high

891
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,359
resolution Vis uh camera you know you

892
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:01,959
know just visible data um we could get

893
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:04,358
at some of the geometric properties you

894
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,159
know say some Char some characteristics

895
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:09,000
they're pretty reliable like the shape

896
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:11,639
of the leaf um or the way the leaves are

897
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,280
are uh are branching um that sort of

898
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:16,920
thing could be a pretty reliable way to

899
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,720
to differentiate between plant types and

900
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,760
then also I think the spectral

901
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:24,159
signatures could be potential on that so

902
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,960
where um you know just something a

903
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,440
pretty a good correlation say you know

904
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,440
something in you know has some kind of

905
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,240
spectral signature in the infrared maybe

906
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,159
in the near infrared that um say corn to

907
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:38,118
sorghum is very different so um yeah

908
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,159
it's something we haven't done but it I

909
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:41,760
bet these these types of sensors could

910
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:44,118
could maybe do it

911
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,040
though

912
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,599
thanks kind of following up on question

913
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:52,358
about timing I you might

914
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,760
consider for your stress and

915
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:58,000
measurements you might have to think

916
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:03,599
about doing more

917
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,599
yeah yeah yeah you of day you want

918
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:10,599
optim differ yeah that's

919
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,199
nice yeah I think um so I guess yeah

920
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,079
saying once that's it's good advice I

921
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,358
think we've been going going to the site

922
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:19,640
once per month but like say this week

923
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:22,559
for instance we had um we had some

924
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:25,440
flights uh kind of late afternoon on one

925
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:27,480
day and then kind of uh earlier morning

926
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,440
I guess it was more midday the next day

927
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,039
so uh temperatures and lighting

928
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,599
conditions were different um but still

929
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,318
you know the the state of the crops was

930
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,400
essentially the same so um yeah that's

931
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:40,679
that's probably yeah you're right that's

932
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:43,119
something that would be probably good

933
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:45,118
practice Yeah thinking about

934
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,240
commercialization for for Growers that

935
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,760
use

936
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:51,519
this how would you imagine that would be

937
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,440
licensing the software and having

938
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:55,960
someone come in with the hardware or

939
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,000
selling the hardware how do you envision

940
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,800
that working in the fure

941
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,159
and maybe you have any idea what would

942
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,560
you think the ball park amount would

943
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,440
cost somebody to do right later on all

944
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:11,639
right sure yeah well we're actually

945
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,280
we're trying to work on kind of three

946
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:15,279
different you know business models

947
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,640
really um you know the from our

948
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,160
company's point of view um you the I

949
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:22,159
think licensing the software uh is

950
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:25,598
probably the you know the the quickest

951
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,358
and easiest way uh to Market um but um

952
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,599
you know selling an integrated Hardware

953
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,719
package you know where it's the whole

954
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:31,359
thing basically the aircraft and the

955
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:34,159
payload or or selling just the the

956
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:37,480
sensor payload um those are very viable

957
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:40,920
too um you know

958
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,960
the most of the I think it's really hard

959
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,920
to

960
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,559
get to get much revenue from or to get

961
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,440
much profit I guess from just selling

962
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:52,400
Hardware packages really um but uh it's

963
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,358
use selling it more as a service I think

964
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,800
could be actually better in a lot of

965
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:58,480
ways because a lot of uh the end users

966
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,440
don't really necessarily want to get

967
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,000
into operating these things or dealing

968
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,720
with owning them maintaining them and

969
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,318
all that but they they like the data so

970
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:09,358
um just for them to hire a service to

971
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:11,880
come in and collect the data and give

972
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,400
them the data is probably a really nice

973
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,680
model um I think in that case we

974
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,838
probably our company wouldn't we would

975
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,519
be the technology developers and owners

976
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:23,039
of the intellectual property but another

977
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:26,239
service providing firm would probably do

978
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:28,719
that um so that that's those are

979
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:31,838
probably the licensing and the servicing

980
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:34,000
probably the two models that are um

981
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:36,239
probably the most likely to work out

982
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,119
well and then um as far as costs you

983
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,159
know we you know on the aircraft side of

984
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:41,240
things it's you know that that

985
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,279
helicopter we're working with is

986
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:46,559
something like you know $660,000

987
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,280
uh then the the smaller one the the not

988
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,920
really smaller but the the hexacopter

989
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,920
one is uh is more uh you know it's more

990
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,200
of a standard product now it's more you

991
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,280
know commercially available um broadly

992
00:41:56,199 --> 00:42:00,838
from the DJI uh that one's about

993
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,000
$155,000 if you get for all the all the

994
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:05,199
hardware needed so that's a lot more

995
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,280
attainable uh for people and then uh

996
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:10,159
especially you know Growers um and then

997
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,359
the sensor package we're looking to get

998
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:15,480
that down from uh you know like a a very

999
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:17,000
ambitious you know the one you know

1000
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,800
we're working with now is something like

1001
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,838
75k for just the hardware right not the

1002
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,400
labor to build it or get it running but

1003
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,159
then second generation we're going to

1004
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,800
bring that down um probably you know

1005
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:31,960
more like 40, 000 in hardware and then a

1006
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,318
commercialized version of that um down

1007
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,318
uh even further maybe uh hopefully more

1008
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:39,639
like

1009
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:40,920
25 so um or maybe even lower you know

1010
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:43,480
with numbers you know at with

1011
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,240
manufacturing scale that could could go

1012
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,240
even

1013
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:47,239
lower

1014
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:55,318
so well uh Paul has uh told me that that

1015
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:57,679
