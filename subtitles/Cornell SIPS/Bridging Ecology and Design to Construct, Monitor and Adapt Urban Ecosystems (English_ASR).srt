1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,849
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,849
University

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:13,849
yeah thanks Tom for inviting me um you

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,798
know I have had a lot of conversation

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:17,509
with Tom over the last several years

6
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:20,089
actually as a practitioner landscape

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,830
architect looking for for research

8
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:23,449
advice on how to set up this design

9
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:26,598
experiment this research experiment with

10
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:29,778
in New York City and so we've had you

11
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,730
know he's been incredibly valuable in

12
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:33,109
that project and reading the website for

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,179
the horticulture program at Cornell I

14
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:37,659
realized that actually it's part of your

15
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:40,070
mission is this kind of agenda to

16
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:42,949
coordinate and communicate with various

17
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,079
publics and to kind of spread knowledge

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,520
and information that really appreciate

19
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,949
that that kind of perspective and not

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,359
approve the the the agenda of the the

21
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,340
kind of combination of academic and

22
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,429
applied which is what I've been trying

23
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,490
to do myself so I run the urban ecology

24
00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:02,269
and design lab which is recent formation

25
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:04,100
about 2010 where we focus on studying

26
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,509
and reshaping human settlements through

27
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,280
research and design with the goal of

28
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:09,409
advancing urban sustainability and

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,118
resilience and I emphasize this

30
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:13,070
combination of studying and shaping

31
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,959
because that's essentially the

32
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:17,209
interdisciplinary approach that I try to

33
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,789
bring to projects is a kind of

34
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:21,530
combination of ecological research to

35
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,000
help quantify different particularly

36
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,219
ecological systems particularly the

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,439
novel ecosystems were creating in urban

38
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:29,179
environments but also recognizing that

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,890
these systems aren't necessarily

40
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,060
functioning in any kind of optimized way

41
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:37,790
how can we shape them as a designer so

42
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,920
my lab focuses on constructed ecosystems

43
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,270
and what do I mean by that construction

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,549
ecosystems or ecosystems that are

45
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:45,769
engineered by human actions they could

46
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,390
be intentional or unintentional and

47
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:48,978
they're often promoted as valuable but

48
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,010
their ecosystem functions and values

49
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:54,950
have not really been that well assessed

50
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,780
or evaluated over time there's some

51
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,469
interesting examples like Michael the

52
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,269
involvement Berg's

53
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:01,280
General Mills project I don't know has

54
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:02,959
anyone seen this project before it's

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,030
actually it was part of the corporate

56
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,879
landscape at General Mills in the

57
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,590
Midwest and it was a prairie constructed

58
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,030
artificial prairie landscape that

59
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,060
actually was surrounded by birch trees

60
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:17,120
just kind of a strange twist on the idea

61
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,090
of fire burning although I guess if you

62
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,069
turned birch inside out you can

63
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,890
it's fire resistant but anyway the the

64
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:26,239
the General Mills corporate office liked

65
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:28,279
it for a little while but eventually it

66
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,629
kind of got old and they removed it so

67
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,300
it was that it wasn't working very well

68
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:33,620
during the burn events when you had guys

69
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,390
in business suits coming in for

70
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,689
corporate meetings it's just sort of a

71
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:40,339
the aesthetic didn't carryover although

72
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:43,699
in our minds I think the aesthetic of a

73
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,319
burned Prairie is something magical so

74
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:47,479
constructed ecosystems it's also

75
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,359
building on you know the recognition

76
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:52,369
that the terrestrial ecosystems are

77
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,940
largely constructed you know and there's

78
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:59,480
a whole wave of kind of refocusing our

79
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:03,199
attention on what we mean by ecosystems

80
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:05,840
today domesticated nature driver or the

81
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,419
the idea of futuristic restoration

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,890
projects and including them the field of

83
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:12,649
restoration ecology which i think is

84
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:14,469
grappling with the ideas of historic

85
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,340
reference landscapes as a guide for

86
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:18,919
reconstructing ecosystems versus

87
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,090
targeted versus target ecosystems and I

88
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:22,099
think you know this this is sort of

89
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,530
where I'm trying to build my own

90
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:27,650
practice as a designer or ecologist so

91
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,870
you know you have examples like Turkey

92
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,569
Point in Florida where you know highly

93
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,769
artificial ecosystem or are highly

94
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,870
artificial landscape that was

95
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:38,509
constructed really as a cooling system

96
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,400
for heated water from the plant ends up

97
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:43,099
supporting 25% of the adult population

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,680
of crocodiles in the in the US so you've

99
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,900
got this kind of sort of you know

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,610
happenstance opportunities like that are

101
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,469
there ways in which we can start to

102
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,940
construct the ecosystems combining them

103
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:54,379
with infrastructure thinking about the

104
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:56,209
resources that were producing in urban

105
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:58,789
environments to promote those systems

106
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,989
part of this is really you know part of

107
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:02,209
this is is it has to do with human

108
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,890
perception in the way that we conceive

109
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,229
of nature and the way that we conceive

110
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:07,669
of ecosystem functions and the kind of

111
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:10,549
tools and methodologies we have to

112
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:13,189
either quantify or interpret those

113
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,230
ecosystem functions so I find that a

114
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:17,620
certain amount of my time is spent

115
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:20,060
negotiating with stakeholders and

116
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,090
working on compromise and sort of

117
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,470
win-win solutions as a way of developing

118
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:28,909
ecological strategies within an urban

119
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:31,880
context so I printplace a lot a lot of

120
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:34,460
emphasis on implementation also

121
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,139
so these are a set of bios wells that

122
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:38,089
we're constructing in Bridgeport that

123
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:42,289
was constructed in Bridgeport and in

124
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:43,399
general my my approach in part is you

125
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,020
know it's publication but also

126
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,879
publication in the real world where

127
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,810
you're where you're building systems

128
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,969
that are part of the urban environment

129
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,250
and evaluating the performance over time

130
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,020
so you know we all know when you think

131
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,509
about urban systems that that they're

132
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:58,609
compromised and that they're young and

133
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:00,589
novel systems and that and that there's

134
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,759
global environmental changes that are

135
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:05,329
taking place that are impacting those

136
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,469
systems in a fun in fundamental ways and

137
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:09,800
we're all we also understand that

138
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,600
there's you know the our understanding

139
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,280
of those systems is somewhat limited so

140
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,450
we understand that some parts of these

141
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,009
systems would not necessarily the

142
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:17,389
interaction between the parts and we're

143
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:20,269
making choices on incomplete information

144
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,949
and we're making choices at scales that

145
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:23,419
may or may not be relevant to people or

146
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:27,019
to or to ecological function or making

147
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:29,689
those linked so ultimately there's a

148
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:32,719
kind of an issue in terms of recognizing

149
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:35,480
the the novelty of urban systems and the

150
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,700
challenges or the shortcomings of

151
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,200
research practices and how do we bridge

152
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:43,789
those together how do we deal with that

153
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:46,159
kind of dilemma in current society so so

154
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,379
- you know there's I've heard a number

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,660
of sort of interest in this area for

156
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:52,100
example ESA has the student group is now

157
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,680
calling or house it has what they call

158
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,560
action science or action ecology where

159
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,240
there's a kind of proactive stance or

160
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,720
proactive agenda to the ecological

161
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,090
practices this kind of can conflict with

162
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,920
ideas of advocacy or the role of

163
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:10,189
objectivity in the sciences and kind of

164
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:13,250
how that how that manifests within sort

165
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:15,709
of a practice oriented science but I

166
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,019
sort of um I'm trying my best to bypass

167
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:20,930
or to incorporate some of those issues

168
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:22,310
into my own work so I you know I call

169
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,290
this area I'm calling this kind of

170
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,639
ecological urban design I'm still sort

171
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,140
of piecing together what the right

172
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,969
terminology might be but essentially

173
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,189
it's a combination of design and ecology

174
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:33,800
is it's a role for practitioner

175
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:35,209
scientists who is from in my case a

176
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,650
landscape architect and ecologists but

177
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:37,989
obviously you can have a variety of

178
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:40,489
combinations of interdisciplinary

179
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,560
practices in order to start to

180
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,319
investigate this area of

181
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,069
and I'm basically combining urban design

182
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,379
oops

183
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:49,790
urban urban design with ecological

184
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,740
engineering at some level to develop

185
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,210
constructed ecosystems and I really

186
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,250
concentrate on parks and parkland

187
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:57,379
networks land development and habitat

188
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,930
and urban forests stormwater hydrology

189
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:01,850
so a little bit of a jack-of-all-trades

190
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:06,350
but part of this my approach is through

191
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:08,960
collaboration with multiple parties okay

192
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,390
so you know the I think within these

193
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,389
constructed ecosystems there is you know

194
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,949
if you talk to any scientist dealing

195
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,389
with urban ecology they're gonna make

196
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,029
the argument that we really need to

197
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:23,240
experiment and to evaluate in to start

198
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:25,309
to develop a set of vocabulary and and

199
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,990
and data and information that lets us

200
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,089
understand what we're talking about with

201
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,379
urban ecosystems what's the kind what's

202
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:32,089
the theoretical framework in which were

203
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:33,889
anticipating they're analyzing urban

204
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:36,229
systems there's a lot of discussion

205
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:37,879
early on about shifting from ecology in

206
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,160
the city to ecology of the city where

207
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,600
there was you know identifying plants

208
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,710
and animals in urban environments and

209
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,680
starting to think of human social

210
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:49,250
ecological factors as constructs of

211
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,780
urban systems and so you know that I

212
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,089
think we're still it's it's still new

213
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:56,419
and developing and the urban ecological

214
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:57,919
theory is not really evolved and - or

215
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,390
manifest it in a way that everyone's

216
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,610
comfortable so it's a kind of field in

217
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:06,649
flux but but I I too am very much

218
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,110
aligned with this agenda of establishing

219
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:10,759
research as a goal or as a first step to

220
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,590
understand systems that were working on

221
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,509
so I developed I write published an

222
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:19,429
article assessed or ticket in 2005

223
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:20,899
called design experiments looking at new

224
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,750
approaches to studying urban ecosystems

225
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:25,039
where you basically develop you kind of

226
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,350
bridge or meld analysis with

227
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,480
implementation so you bridge applied

228
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,370
management academic science and you it

229
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,570
facilitates situating research in

230
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,000
multiple locations and urban

231
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,349
environments it allows you to

232
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,519
incorporate an education component

233
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,570
because you're essentially creating a

234
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,610
public research experiment and you know

235
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,080
navigates the complex public process and

236
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,480
government agencies which I would say

237
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,070
the experiment itself may or may not but

238
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,110
I think the combination of design and

239
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,120
ecology allows you to move back and

240
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:57,839
forth and negotiate opportunities with

241
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:00,179
government agencies etc it allows you to

242
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,439
start to in start to incorporate

243
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:03,179
research as a component of

244
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:06,088
infrastructure in urban environments

245
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:08,338
which is the essential step and gives a

246
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:09,959
public identity and negotiates sort of

247
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,660
public space values versus ecosystem

248
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,789
services so it takes advantage of

249
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:16,409
ecologists who are already studying

250
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:19,828
complex systems and are already involved

251
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:22,350
in trying to interpret you know multi

252
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:25,169
multiple variables multiple you know

253
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,689
complex analysis on species interactions

254
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:29,399
etc so ecologists have already been sort

255
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:31,708
of banging their head against trying to

256
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,078
decipher and interpret ecosystem

257
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,958
functions in non urban systems so here's

258
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:39,688
an opportunity to take advantage of

259
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:41,128
ecological methods ecological theory and

260
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:43,679
to start thinking about what it means

261
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:45,899
for urban design urban urban ecosystems

262
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,299
etc and designers in my mind or agents

263
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,759
of change and agents I think is an

264
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:53,188
important term here because they are can

265
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,459
help ecologists in situating research

266
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:58,498
experiments in an urban context and

267
00:09:55,458 --> 00:10:01,049
weaving research experiments into public

268
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:02,850
or into decision making or into public

269
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:06,208
institutions like parkland does all show

270
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,850
you okay so you know I have sort of

271
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:10,039
three focus areas of my own and to which

272
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,379
I'm going to really talk about today

273
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:16,980
green infrastructure ecological planning

274
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,480
and in wildlife habitat actually so I'll

275
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,928
just mention on the wildlife habitat

276
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,600
side just for kind of to give you a

277
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:26,039
context that my PhD research actually

278
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,808
was looking at suburbanization and

279
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,578
amphibian populations with a large-scale

280
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:30,178
land development forty miles north of

281
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:32,638
New York City

282
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:34,649
so actually basically was working as a

283
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,528
master planner on a master planning team

284
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:38,610
with EDA with that related company in

285
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:40,259
New York and they were developing a

286
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,749
twelve hundred acre about a five hundred

287
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:44,938
hectare site at forty miles north that

288
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:47,278
had a lot of Infineon populations a lot

289
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:48,928
of breeding populations on site and you

290
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,399
know they wanted to develop in the

291
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:51,899
breeding the amphibians were in the way

292
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,909
essentially which is the typical story

293
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,789
of a large

294
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:57,199
development project and so I sold the

295
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:00,279
developer on the idea that we could

296
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,290
incorporate research and migration

297
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:06,159
patterns and look at amphibian migration

298
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:08,990
as a way of actually increasing the

299
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,579
opportunity for housing so we actually

300
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,259
made the developer money in our first

301
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,550
analysis somewhere around seven million

302
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,809
dollars worth of housing property

303
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:17,000
because essentially the vernal pool

304
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:20,119
system that was surrounded by loop road

305
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,860
and was you know we devastated because

306
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,929
this is the watershed as you can see so

307
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,960
it was not only migration corridors but

308
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:29,000
watershed impacts etc the what happened

309
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,460
was the Planning Board the environment

310
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,539
consultant hired by the Planning Board

311
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,460
identified this as a problematic issue

312
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:35,750
and really was it was raised as an

313
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,509
obstacle to kind of slow down the

314
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,159
development and the developer wanted to

315
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:42,319
make sure he got the 24 houses that were

316
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,569
there and so he he was looking for any

317
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,920
option so the idea was well let's do a

318
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,150
migration study look at where the

319
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,709
migrating patterns are and since

320
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:50,600
amphibians are fairly predictable in

321
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:53,090
terms of their migration paths we could

322
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,710
realign housing and have these kind of

323
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,259
migration corridors almost like teeth in

324
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,870
the location of the houses and what

325
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:02,689
happened was we did the migration 65%

326
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,830
we're coming from this angle and so the

327
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,420
developer immediately thought of the

328
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,700
idea of shifting housing either side

329
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:09,259
which ended up preserving the the

330
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,170
watershed as well and maintaining

331
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:14,480
migration corridors and getting 16

332
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:15,829
houses out of 24 so he was so excited

333
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,810
about it did he actually let me do the

334
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:21,110
same research across the entire property

335
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:22,459
to inform the overall master plan and so

336
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,769
we ended up this was the first site that

337
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,090
we studied and the migration patterns we

338
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:28,819
ended up setting up the same kind of

339
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:31,129
research and analysis and reorganizing

340
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,580
the development which is shown here in

341
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:36,110
this kind of array getting rid of one of

342
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,629
the major roads moving neighborhoods

343
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,100
around of course the typical the develop

344
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:41,419
developer you know they have a pro-forma

345
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,000
with a certain number of houses that

346
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:45,860
they're trying to get into a site so as

347
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,179
you push in one area then it pops up in

348
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,070
another area which is exactly what

349
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:51,049
happened here as well so there's kind of

350
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,270
a this relationship between academic

351
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:54,949
research and develop land development is

352
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:57,409
an interesting one because of course the

353
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:59,060
developer took advantage or used the

354
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:02,019
empirical data that was coming out of

355
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:04,429
the analysis toward to his advantage to

356
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:06,649
negotiate housing and

357
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:09,949
to push past some of the time

358
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:11,089
constraints of some of the time

359
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:14,629
constraints that are typical of a

360
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:17,270
permitting process we in the second

361
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:19,789
stage we we actually did a larval

362
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:22,338
density study looking at variation in

363
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:26,179
habitat quality across ponds and we

364
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:27,680
noted that the typical and habitat

365
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:29,750
assessment approaches with vernal pool

366
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,149
systems are looking at species

367
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,070
populations species richness that's kind

368
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:37,100
of a prioritized component but what I

369
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,980
found was when I'm in setting up a

370
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,980
research experiment where I put

371
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,259
amphibian populations where stocked and

372
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,560
ferry populations in each pond with 0 8

373
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:50,389
16 and 24 to look at whether density was

374
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,699
more have more of an impact versus over

375
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:54,379
habitat variation I found that habitat

376
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,550
variation explained a lot more of the

377
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:57,740
survival and growth rate of the

378
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:59,329
amphibians above population density

379
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,589
which starts to suggest or at least

380
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,899
opens the questions about whether

381
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,940
current habitat assessment practices are

382
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:07,789
effective or not and whether they need

383
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:11,959
to prioritize wetland habitats more than

384
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:14,389
species population density so we ended

385
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:17,719
up finding on the study also in the

386
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:19,639
process the least shrew because we were

387
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,769
wrapping fences with them you know we're

388
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,639
wrapping ponds with drift fences which

389
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:23,870
meant that you basically caught

390
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,879
everything that moved in and out and so

391
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,620
we had these incidentals one of them was

392
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:30,350
the least true which turned out to be a

393
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,299
species an endangered species which

394
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,950
raised other issues for the developer so

395
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:35,659
it was a very funny back and forth that

396
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,879
happened where the lost a lawsuit will

397
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:41,439
went out on the developer from the from

398
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:43,399
the town to address this issue of

399
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,310
species that weren't identified during

400
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:49,009
the EIS report so and then basically

401
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:51,799
from that I developed a series of scales

402
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:54,259
of importance that land developers are

403
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,879
sorry that master planners currently are

404
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:58,278
not necessarily incorporating into their

405
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,350
process of design and development you

406
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:02,299
know the meta population is simply not

407
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,740
interpreted at all except you might

408
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:06,199
argue that some of the habitat corridors

409
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,519
developed or are towards that intention

410
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,110
but there's really very little attention

411
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,059
to watersheds which are kind of a

412
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,180
fundamental part of amphibian breeding

413
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:16,479
needs migration corridors you know the

414
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,338
ponds in New York have zero

415
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,199
in New Jersey a 100-foot buffer but

416
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:21,699
amphibians travel as much as a thousand

417
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:26,378
feet so we're there's a discrepancy

418
00:15:21,698 --> 00:15:28,539
between these as well okay so that this

419
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:30,999
approach you know the the approach that

420
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:34,448
I was using in my PhD was really focused

421
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:36,489
on on marrying science and and research

422
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:38,798
practices with master plan last master

423
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:40,089
planning which is a particular side of

424
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:42,548
this approach and it has more to do with

425
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:43,989
conservation I think then that and then

426
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:45,759
kind of the proactive constructed

427
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:47,859
ecosystem approach that I introduced at

428
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,568
the beginning but I want to return now

429
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:51,970
to this idea of constructed ecosystems

430
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:54,399
and look at particularly at restoration

431
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,999
ecologists who who I see is one of

432
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:01,438
several sub disciplines that are

433
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:04,298
actually grappling with what it means to

434
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:07,358
reinterpret their theory and basis of

435
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:09,338
practice in the 21st century you know so

436
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:11,499
there's part of this is that restoration

437
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:15,249
ecologists are now working more and more

438
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:17,470
with designers to develop Park systems

439
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:19,418
that are functional or have some kind of

440
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,879
ecosystem components to them so in this

441
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:24,308
case originally Steven Hendel from

442
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:26,048
Rutgers was working with Michael Van

443
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:27,038
Valkenburgh Sophos on the Brooklyn

444
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:28,899
Bridge project

445
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:30,369
more recently great ecology and there

446
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:31,808
you know there's ideas about wetland

447
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:33,519
construction that are taking place there

448
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:36,368
it's highly constrained as you can

449
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,188
imagine and so the the benefits that you

450
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:40,389
get for the costs are kind of not you

451
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:41,948
can't really do that analysis very

452
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:44,709
easily for such an urbanized park

453
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:47,168
there's also great Park in Orange County

454
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:51,458
in California that Penndel is working on

455
00:16:47,168 --> 00:16:55,600
as well and where there's basically an

456
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:58,628
effort to marry or to program parkland

457
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,879
for ecological benefit and then the

458
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:03,360
issue becomes well how do you how do you

459
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:06,278
incorporate human use patterns into this

460
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,360
ecologically structured park system so

461
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:09,849
that's one of the dilemmas I think

462
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,259
within the restoration field so it's you

463
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:12,698
know there's a unique heritage within

464
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:14,619
restoration ecology it's an intentional

465
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,939
activity that initiates or accelerates

466
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:18,038
the recovery of an ecosystem with

467
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:19,600
respect to its health integrity and

468
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,158
sustainability attempts to return an

469
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,588
ecosystem to its historic trajectory

470
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:24,579
based on reference ecosystems and it

471
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:26,378
relies on careful and systematic

472
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:27,720
planning and monitoring approaches with

473
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:31,139
establish goals and performance

474
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,519
towards ecosystem recovery and there's

475
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,520
this opportunity for restoration and

476
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:37,529
applied ecology where we're

477
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,690
practitioners are trying or looking to

478
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:40,769
expand their territories essentially and

479
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,820
this has to do with the number of

480
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,069
factors that we're facing today

481
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,359
including invasive species or you know

482
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:48,928
coastal resilience and global warming

483
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:51,990
etc so I see it is uniquely placed but I

484
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:53,820
also think it provides a it starts to

485
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:57,179
expose some of the issues that we face

486
00:17:53,819 --> 00:18:00,089
and how to marry the or how to rethink

487
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:02,759
our approach you know the there there

488
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:04,199
Restoration comedy builds on on things

489
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,119
like agriculture where you're dealing

490
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,610
with production and optimization

491
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,319
practices so there's a whole working

492
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:13,168
component to restoration ecology that

493
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,428
has relevance within an urban context it

494
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:17,429
also where there is incomplete knowledge

495
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:19,530
and there's the necessary necessity to

496
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,360
make decisions on incomplete knowledge

497
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:23,190
which i think is one of the differences

498
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,519
between a lot of the applied ecologists

499
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,169
and the basic science approaches so it's

500
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,658
expanding into these new applications

501
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:32,820
adaption adaptation methods efforts to

502
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:35,250
quantify yuka system services ways of

503
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:37,079
controlling invasive species thinking

504
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,669
about natural landscaping to substitute

505
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,889
for lawns or habitats and public park

506
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:42,980
amenities you know and they're working

507
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:46,140
on land types that are fundamentally

508
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,569
urban and that have that really need to

509
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,960
be re-evaluated and reconstructed for

510
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:53,099
future promotion of ecosystem services

511
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,808
and urban environments they're dealing

512
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,869
with abandoned sites brownfields

513
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:59,639
wetlands etc but you know there's

514
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:01,969
questions about what to prioritize and

515
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,799
how important are people in this system

516
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,750
you know when you're fall if you're

517
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:07,769
following the money how do you or you do

518
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,230
you follow the money or do you follow

519
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:12,000
the the best ecological benefits in

520
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,259
terms of prioritization and how do you

521
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,819
assess the long-term resilience and

522
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:17,190
sustainability and then there's this

523
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:19,048
other aspect of the aesthetic form I

524
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,048
think which is an important component of

525
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:24,089
restoration ecology that I'll mention in

526
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:25,679
a second but um and then finally this

527
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:27,089
idea of defining ecosystem function how

528
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,130
do you define these systems with an

529
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:31,949
urban type organized concept constant

530
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:34,230
construct so you know historically

531
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,569
restoration ecologists have tended

532
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,279
towards naturalistic design strategies

533
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:39,658
so even though I wouldn't say I would

534
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,710
say that most restoration ecologist

535
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:44,130
probably would not say

536
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,690
they have a design ideology there's a

537
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,778
default design ideology which is

538
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,240
essentially naturalistic may construct a

539
00:19:48,778 --> 00:19:53,130
system to make it look like nature you

540
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,480
know and also hopefully construct the

541
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,100
system to make it function like nature

542
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,778
but looking like nature doesn't

543
00:19:56,099 --> 00:20:01,349
necessarily mean functioning like nature

544
00:19:57,778 --> 00:20:03,869
so in looking like nature it also has

545
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:05,308
some problems with it for example and

546
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,859
this is something that joy zedler has

547
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:09,928
mentioned you know when you construct

548
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:12,000
these systems that look natural and you

549
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:15,450
go through the the pains of kind of

550
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,589
organizing in organic forms it's often

551
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,308
can be from a construction standpoint

552
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:22,619
more costly also you um it's hard to

553
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:24,058
compare those systems to other systems

554
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:25,918
that you create so you're not actually

555
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:28,950
you're actually losing an opportunity to

556
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,360
embed research components and modularity

557
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,399
into the system that you can evaluate

558
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:34,709
over time and test and evaluate

559
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,849
performance so you're you're you you end

560
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,679
up spending all fair amount of money

561
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:39,329
constructing a system that's essentially

562
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,570
a one-off and that you can evaluate as a

563
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:44,699
whole the other issue in my mind at

564
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:46,288
least is that you know funding

565
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,819
opportunities trying to get funding to

566
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:49,079
construct these kinds of things often

567
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:51,210
the funder is looking for something that

568
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,308
it can be identified and when you have a

569
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,110
restoration site next to an adjacent

570
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:57,329
Natural Area and they look almost the

571
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:59,398
same it becomes kind of difficult for um

572
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:01,740
you know to get money or solicit funding

573
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:03,000
in an urbanized world where you're you

574
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:07,200
know you want it to have some identity

575
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,849
or meaning so on top of that I think

576
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
many restoration ecologists remain

577
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:13,619
dedicated to their traditional practices

578
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,269
which is understandable because you know

579
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:17,819
in a way the notion identifying a

580
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:20,700
historic reference is sort of a it's a

581
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:23,069
way forward it's a way to have to

582
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,450
validate decision making and if you

583
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:26,428
don't have that approach and you're

584
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,798
thinking only into the future or into

585
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:30,480
some kind of you know futuristic or

586
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:34,099
target ecosystems it's more challenging

587
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,259
to think to design what you prioritize

588
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:38,278
okay so as restoration ecologists expand

589
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:40,500
their breasts are rethinking the

590
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:41,869
reference ecosystems and they're more

591
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,339
and more working with stakeholder

592
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:46,709
communities so just an example of a

593
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:48,599
recent project that I see is being kind

594
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,090
of a futuristic restoration I don't have

595
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,169
people gone to the Museum of Modern Art

596
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:54,599
rising turns

597
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,009
and make it down to the the rising turn

598
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:57,599
so there was some interesting projects

599
00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:00,779
there it was very fairly architectural

600
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:04,740
but um Kate ORFs project called oyster

601
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:06,629
texture was this notion of taking the

602
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:12,440
lifecycle of the oyster and mapping it

603
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:12,440
onto the harbor of New York City and

604
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:22,079
she basically the notion was essentially

605
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:23,879
to to organize the the early stage of

606
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,529
the organism so that it would be

607
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,900
essentially be play a role in cleaning

608
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:30,289
the kiwanis Canal and then to move that

609
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,820
system into a kind of wave attenuation

610
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:36,779
structure that would where you

611
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:38,429
essentially plant these organisms along

612
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:40,410
as a kind of buffer or wave attenuation

613
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:44,370
for New York City so there was and she

614
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:46,769
started to bridge those ideas with you

615
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:50,219
know pedestrian paths for example where

616
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:52,019
the the ecological systems would be

617
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,299
underneath the paths for ease of access

618
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:57,379
and started to incorporate it into the

619
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:57,379
design of the city

620
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:05,100
okay so part of this idea or this

621
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,570
approach to bridge ecological strategies

622
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:08,490
with design incidents that kind of build

623
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:10,799
on the restoration ecology approach has

624
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,750
to do with compromise and I find again

625
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,519
and again that I'm trying to determine

626
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,160
where and how to compromise and I think

627
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:20,250
that this is a struggle for the science

628
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,480
world because ultimately you don't you

629
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,589
know there's things that you can

630
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,110
compromise and there's things that you

631
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:26,549
can't and it's it's a tough you know

632
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:29,219
it's a challenge to decide what you give

633
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:31,440
up one of the things that I asked John

634
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:34,950
abran he was visiting Yale recently was

635
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,210
whether you know if he was actually

636
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,950
talking about this notion of compromise

637
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,029
and so I asked well with you is there

638
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,500
are there ways in which we would then

639
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:42,720
compromise the science in order to

640
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,819
incorporate it into for example into the

641
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,160
time scale of a land development project

642
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:49,019
so if a land development master planning

643
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,470
process takes you know nine months to a

644
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:54,660
year or maybe a year and a half you know

645
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,860
there's always so much research that you

646
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,750
can be able to do that's netting that

647
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:00,029
from a science perspective that's going

648
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,529
to be valuable I mean you might get one

649
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:03,869
season you might get two seasons in if

650
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:05,230
you're strategic but you know that in

651
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:06,489
other words you know the data

652
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,140
the results aren't going to be as useful

653
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:11,140
or add from a science perspective aren't

654
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:13,660
gonna be as helpful so but but you know

655
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,700
that in and we debated discuss to that

656
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,679
topic and his sense was that the science

657
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,720
is the science and the approach is you

658
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,519
stick by a certain methodology that's

659
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,259
been developed or your results are not

660
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,418
as useful or not as valuable and so I

661
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:26,859
think this is a real struggle I looked

662
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:29,400
into this a little bit while working at

663
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:32,500
IDO I got a client and practice grant to

664
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,990
to participate with Presidio Trust which

665
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,089
is on the west coast and if folks have

666
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,700
been to this pretty amazing post

667
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:43,689
military landscape right in San

668
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,830
Francisco it's it's um it's interesting

669
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,210
for a lot of reasons but there's a

670
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:48,009
number of stakeholders there there you

671
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,690
got the the cultural historians who

672
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:51,220
basically you know it's a historic

673
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,750
landmark and not only are the buildings

674
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,548
historically landmarked but the

675
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,230
landscape is historically a landmark so

676
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:57,819
for those of you that have been there

677
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,980
the it was one of the largest a

678
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:03,308
forestation efforts in the country from

679
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:06,308
the 1880s 1890s where they're actually

680
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:08,529
trees were planted in monoculture blocks

681
00:25:06,308 --> 00:25:11,079
in regiments to mimic the military

682
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:13,269
history eucalyptus and a variety of

683
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:15,609
other species and they grew up into a

684
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:17,918
mature canopy so the whole ecosystem

685
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:20,019
this this you know scrub shrub community

686
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,880
coastal community is a forested

687
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:23,589
environment that a lot of people think

688
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,190
of as being the historic nature of that

689
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:28,240
area so there's a very complicated

690
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:31,720
stakeholder relationship to this

691
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,240
landscape partly historical partly the

692
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,579
public users who walk their dogs there

693
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,650
and would die to see these trees removed

694
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:42,250
you know partly the maintenance folks

695
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:44,769
and and partly the restoration folks who

696
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:47,048
actually are very keen on on removing

697
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:50,379
the forest and trying to replace it with

698
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:51,579
a biologically rich environment so we

699
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,950
were working with each of these

700
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:55,329
stakeholders and through dialogue

701
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,860
negotiating or learning about what their

702
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:59,259
drivers were what their interests were

703
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:03,428
so we dealt with public groups with

704
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:05,890
nature lovers and with historical folks

705
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:07,570
and there's a you know this is all by

706
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,669
the way in National Park so it became

707
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:11,109
went shifted from a military base to a

708
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:13,509
national park so it's under the National

709
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:15,279
Park Service it's the most urban or one

710
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:16,569
of the most urban national parks at this

711
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:21,069
gateway and you're

712
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:22,778
another but it's um so you've got not

713
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:25,298
only is a public the local public who

714
00:26:22,778 --> 00:26:26,710
live adjacent and there's actually sixty

715
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:29,168
million square feet of real estate on

716
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,480
site so people actually rent property on

717
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:32,799
the historic base but there's people

718
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,038
living right outside and then there's

719
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:38,589
the entire United States public who you

720
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,980
know who has some rights to this land as

721
00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:43,658
the National Park so we were working on

722
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,089
a particular area that is becoming their

723
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:49,059
sustainability Center and we were there

724
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:51,878
was a biologically rich sort of creek

725
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:54,278
bed here that had the generals house at

726
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:56,709
the top right here and and military

727
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:58,409
housing here by the way this is the only

728
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:01,269
community garden on the entire property

729
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:02,289
there's a list of hundreds and hundreds

730
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:04,509
of people that want to have a community

731
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:07,808
garden on that on the Presidio and the

732
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:09,878
but the historic stakeholders have

733
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:11,859
fought them off for years so that

734
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,509
there's their what the restoration

735
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:15,719
ecologists are that's re the community

736
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:19,240
gardeners then went into the map library

737
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,298
and look through old maps and found that

738
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,069
there had been a a Victory Garden on

739
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:25,480
this particular property on this area

740
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:27,148
and so they got their gardening their

741
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,349
community garden it's like a one acre

742
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:31,178
piece out of about twelve hundred acres

743
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:32,888
so you know this was a pretty

744
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:34,960
interesting site because it had been

745
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:37,449
designed as a public garden so it was a

746
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,308
historical garden its associated with

747
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,929
the generals house but it also had been

748
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:44,138
left alone for quite a while and so it

749
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:49,120
had grown and was and and the the

750
00:27:44,138 --> 00:27:51,250
community developed restoration ecology

751
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,038
group had a greenhouse system here and

752
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:57,278
had been pretty actively restoring this

753
00:27:54,038 --> 00:28:00,759
creek bed system so there's a lot of

754
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,200
involvement here by the one last point

755
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:04,929
was that the same group that had worked

756
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:09,250
here had worked on Inspiration Point

757
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:10,990
which is right around there and

758
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,000
basically Inspiration Point is the

759
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:15,099
highest point in Presidio and it's got

760
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,519
ever had at one point a fantastic view

761
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:19,959
of the whole Bay but the trees had grown

762
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:22,450
up and blocked the entire view so you

763
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,710
couldn't see anything so the Presidio

764
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:28,710
trusts coordinated with the local

765
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:31,140
restoration ecologists and developed a

766
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,299
community-driven restoration project

767
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,759
there where Presidio thrusts came out at

768
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:37,829
night and cut down the trees removed

769
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,629
them and had them that right away in the

770
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:44,429
morning after everyone was out planting

771
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:46,800
locally gathered seed seed plants from

772
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,779
local genotypes so it was this kind of a

773
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,909
political strategy using logical

774
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:52,710
restoration at folks as it kind of means

775
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,720
to negotiate and of course the views

776
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,340
fantastic now and everyone's happy about

777
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,319
it but it's hard to get past that first

778
00:28:56,339 --> 00:29:00,449
wave so we found in our analysis that

779
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,589
essentially there wasn't one solution to

780
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:05,970
this strategy it was too small to really

781
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:07,740
have your cake and eat it too and we

782
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,390
came up with this idea that this bridge

783
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,440
that actually really just became a kind

784
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:15,450
of an illustration of the compromises

785
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,250
that were that one might make with a

786
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,809
site like this essentially you could

787
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,369
have wildlife habitat and no human

788
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:22,049
access where you could view over the

789
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:23,939
system or maybe you have a bridge that

790
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:26,549
crosses it so you have controlled access

791
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,799
and wildlife viewing or you could have

792
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:30,000
complete access and make it into a park

793
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,740
system so it becomes more of an

794
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,779
integrated Park but then your ecological

795
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,420
benefits aside from water quality and

796
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:37,649
impacts that are highly reduced so you

797
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,060
know what we found from this was that

798
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,710
you you ended up with a bunch of

799
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,539
questions you know what's more valuable

800
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,910
in an urban park setting is it public

801
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,589
access or habitat preservation what

802
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,269
takes precedent in the historic national

803
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:50,220
park ecosystem function or historic

804
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:51,779
preservation you know can public use and

805
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,100
recreation be integrated with habitat

806
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,869
enhancement and control of visitation

807
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:56,339
and how can one ensure that opposing

808
00:29:54,869 --> 00:29:57,689
stakeholders reach a winning consensus

809
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:59,459
rather than everyone giving up too much

810
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,110
which in some ways is what we found

811
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,490
through this process is that no one was

812
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:06,359
really willing to give up their

813
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:07,829
perspective easily okay so I've talked a

814
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:09,599
little bit about design experiments and

815
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:11,849
this strategy that I've been putting

816
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,889
forward in terms of coupling ecological

817
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:15,419
research and urban design as a means to

818
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,190
move forward and part of the argument is

819
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:20,370
here you know traditional research

820
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,440
approaches you set up you know ecologist

821
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:24,829
are looking to study this system to

822
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,850
understand how it works so you set up a

823
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:28,740
experimentation you analyze the system

824
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:30,959
and from your results you have it you

825
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,029
can get ideas as a kind of adaptive

826
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,890
management for example to alter the

827
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:37,170
system and as a kind of feedback with

828
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:39,270
design experiments you're sort of taking

829
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,740
for granted you're assuming that this

830
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:42,089
is not necessarily working all that well

831
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,670
or you're working with a constructed

832
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:47,759
system where you can manipulate the

833
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:49,140
system and and put in a kind of new

834
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:50,549
functioning system that you can then

835
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,820
analyze over time so it's a kind of

836
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:55,319
proactive approach that brings in the

837
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:57,629
science and research strategy but it

838
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:01,529
brings it in in the process of change so

839
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:03,870
at the same time experimentation is it

840
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:06,059
has an interesting aesthetic there is

841
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:08,039
you know spatial sort of modularity to

842
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:12,419
the experimentation there's a kind of

843
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:14,700
geometry driven by statistical means or

844
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,460
statistical needs but it actually has a

845
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:20,009
relation to kind of a design aesthetic

846
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,150
or design practices so I'm going to talk

847
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:22,470
about that in a second but I wanted to

848
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,509
give you an example of a design

849
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,610
experiment that I proposed for the High

850
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:28,470
Line where basically it's a prairie

851
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:30,449
ecosystem highly constructed prairie

852
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,860
ecosystem on porous paving and you

853
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,960
basically use a fire-retardant material

854
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:35,849
periodically and you'd burn a strip and

855
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,200
then that would become your path and

856
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:38,490
then you know two or three years down

857
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,080
the line you'd burn another strip and

858
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,930
then that would become your path and

859
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,819
then there would be a self-seeding

860
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:48,180
prairie kind of landscape for education

861
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:49,769
purposes for example at the same time

862
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,880
design experiments have this stakeholder

863
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:52,799
outreach or stakeholder engagement

864
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,050
component to it it's in the public realm

865
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,669
it's a research driven but it's also

866
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:59,389
implementation based and through this

867
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:01,320
kind of implementation practice such as

868
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:03,780
projects that I worked on in Harlem on

869
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,309
the community garden 123rd Street it's a

870
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:08,220
way of getting people involved and you

871
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:12,029
start to you know people come out of the

872
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,380
woodwork or start to participate in land

873
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:16,109
development especially in an urbanized

874
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,360
context and then finally it's really the

875
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:20,099
intention is also to generate and

876
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:22,279
develop urban ecology as a science and

877
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:25,549
to start to think about ways such as

878
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:32,220
Larry Baker's work on household scale

879
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:34,169
ecosystem dynamics to think about scales

880
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,819
of analysis that are appropriate or that

881
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:40,769
are meaningful to decision-makers

882
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:41,970
policymakers and were homeowners okay so

883
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:45,170
I've mentioned this idea of the

884
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:48,089
aesthetics of experimentation and

885
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:49,740
actually and so I wanted to just go

886
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:51,609
through and show you a few examples of

887
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:54,669
what I'm thinking about here

888
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:56,319
so you know there's Tillman's work you

889
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:58,450
know these kind of music azam ideas

890
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:01,499
Hubbard Brook this is a million trees

891
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:05,379
project I'm gonna show you know there's

892
00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:07,509
going back to the idea of the concern

893
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:09,849
that I raised about restoration

894
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:12,249
ecologists and how there's a default

895
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:15,069
naturalistic design intent behind the

896
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:17,519
approach for a designer going through

897
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:20,908
for example my experience at Harvard

898
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,739
everyone is hypersensitive to what your

899
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:25,210
your design influences are it's a it's a

900
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:26,319
hypersensitivity and actually for

901
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,239
landscape architects in the United

902
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,589
States one of the biggest challenges is

903
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:33,100
how to get out of the underneath the

904
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:36,509
shadow of Olmstead who has created this

905
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:39,128
incredible shadow partly because of his

906
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:41,288
mamaia projects and the the breadth of

907
00:33:39,128 --> 00:33:43,298
his projects but you know he brought in

908
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:46,089
this whole notion of the picturesque

909
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:48,368
from the English which really evolved

910
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:50,168
out of a rural agrarian landscape

911
00:33:48,368 --> 00:33:52,209
quality that ended up that went through

912
00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:54,580
the painting it made its way to the

913
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,869
landscape design and and then when it

914
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:57,569
was brought to the States my

915
00:33:55,868 --> 00:34:00,158
interpretation is that it kind of

916
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:02,528
coagulated or sort of gelled with the

917
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,999
wilderness ethic or the wilderness

918
00:34:02,528 --> 00:34:05,618
concept and you know people have talked

919
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:07,329
about the idea that Yellowstone was

920
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:09,098
probably selected because it had been

921
00:34:07,329 --> 00:34:11,409
cleared periodically through burning

922
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:13,720
practices and reminded people of the

923
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:15,159
idealic nature so you know as a

924
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,168
landscape architect this this is

925
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,480
actually a pretty big challenge you know

926
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:22,868
am i do I design naturalistically or not

927
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,510
is you know it's a sort of branch in the

928
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:27,730
in the field and a lot of landscape

929
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:31,000
architect's struggle with the redefining

930
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:33,579
an aesthetic while often being pegged as

931
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,619
or being requested to do naturalistic

932
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:36,909
design because not only is it a dilemma

933
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:39,639
in the field of landscape architecture

934
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:44,048
it's a it's a perception or an idea held

935
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:45,929
by Americans at large because all sense

936
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:48,068
Park systems and others afterwards

937
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:50,409
essentially introduce the picturesque

938
00:34:48,068 --> 00:34:52,029
across the country so everyone when you

939
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,079
think about a park for most people you

940
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,819
think about a park you think of a

941
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:57,068
picturesque style or naturalistic Park

942
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:58,659
it's very different in Europe where

943
00:34:57,068 --> 00:35:02,079
there's a lot of geometry as a component

944
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:04,089
so design experiments bypass that

945
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,430
ideology dialogical layer

946
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:08,769
get ecologists and designers negotiating

947
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:12,039
and working around statistical drivers

948
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:13,509
and geometry and modularity as a medium

949
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:15,849
through which you can come up with

950
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:18,430
design aesthetic this is Robert

951
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:20,170
Smithson's project where he called an on

952
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:22,539
site where he would take material from

953
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,880
sites organize it in some sort of a

954
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:26,199
frame and then bring it off-site and

955
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,730
have these kind of like the six

956
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:29,319
materials of his site would all be in

957
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:32,349
these kind of containers he was very

958
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,750
interested in in what material meant

959
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:36,900
when it was removed from an area or were

960
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:39,639
given a kind of structure you know

961
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,050
there's Allen Sanborn topographic

962
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:44,319
projections where there is a kind of

963
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:46,810
effort to create modularity around an

964
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,150
organic form you know in the structures

965
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:51,489
to frame that there's also a whole

966
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:53,170
investigation into dynamic systems and

967
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:55,239
dynamic patterns and how to represent

968
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:58,119
those or how to represent multifaceted

969
00:35:55,239 --> 00:36:00,549
perspectives so this idea of dynamic

970
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:01,869
ecosystems has relevance in the art

971
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:04,030
world it's a question partly of

972
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:07,989
determining how to bridge the the

973
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:09,400
dialogue you know there's a so from that

974
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:11,799
I've kind of pushed for this idea of a

975
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:16,119
collage aesthetic which basically takes

976
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:18,850
maybe some some of Gleason's mapping of

977
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:22,000
prairie ecosystems and in the UW

978
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:25,150
Arboretum in that dynamic nature and

979
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,610
builds on the the data rich capacity of

980
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:30,400
designers today or the ability to kind

981
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:33,190
of crunch a lot of information with the

982
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,750
various programs to think about it a

983
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,400
design aesthetic I've always been

984
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,789
interested in REM cool houses project

985
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,309
for Downsview Park as a as a site for

986
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:44,170
researching Island biogeography and

987
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:46,210
habitat for doors it wasn't really part

988
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,500
of the study at all but it's it's you

989
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:49,960
know he had this notion that he would

990
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:53,260
create circles of ecosystems or circles

991
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,119
of landscape that would be programmed

992
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:58,050
and you know would be great to set up

993
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,219
some kind of a large-scale study on on

994
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:02,519
animal migration patterns or animal

995
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:05,319
movement patterns across these patches

996
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:07,809
and then there's precedent for combining

997
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,309
science and design going back you know

998
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:11,590
going we're going way back but I think

999
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:13,000
Mel Chen's revival field with the USDA

1000
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:15,220
chemists and

1001
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,789
one of the earliest reclamation projects

1002
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:20,318
in the country funded by art money for a

1003
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:21,489
kind of science project I think is a

1004
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:24,219
really interesting example of this

1005
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:27,009
bridging okay so I want to just now take

1006
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:30,399
you into or discuss the million trees

1007
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:32,170
project which I worked on first at at e

1008
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,329
da which actually you'd all have merged

1009
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,230
with AECOM design so it became a giant

1010
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:42,490
conglomerate while I was there but

1011
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:49,420
basically we sorry we won the project in

1012
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:51,969
2008 with it was through EDA and donna

1013
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,440
wall cabbage in new york Donna had a

1014
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:55,239
on-call contract with the parks

1015
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,380
department there are eight landscape

1016
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,969
architecture firms that have on-call

1017
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,858
contracts with the New York City Parks

1018
00:37:57,969 --> 00:38:01,989
Department and so any project that comes

1019
00:37:59,858 --> 00:38:04,358
out they've been on it and whoever is

1020
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:06,608
deemed the best bidder wins the project

1021
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:08,730
when this project came along it was a

1022
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:10,588
very unusual project for those eight

1023
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:15,219
practitioners because it really had a

1024
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:17,230
underlying you know research and science

1025
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:19,269
questions and and the kinds of the kinds

1026
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,190
of issues that the Cornell horticultural

1027
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:23,920
is probably the making them one of the

1028
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:25,480
most adept you know or the kind of depth

1029
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,858
that you that you show here but in the

1030
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,199
practitioner world you know you don't

1031
00:38:26,858 --> 00:38:30,909
have that kind of knowledge base

1032
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:34,019
thinking about how to construct an urban

1033
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:39,190
forest you know and what and and so

1034
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:41,170
Donna called edawn and we decided to

1035
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:43,929
partner and then we created a series of

1036
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:47,409
outreach efforts including my telephone

1037
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:49,568
calls to Tom what LO to try to infuse

1038
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:54,940
this process with research ideas and

1039
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:57,550
research education so you know the I

1040
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:59,230
remember sitting at a community meeting

1041
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:01,240
and one of the community members asking

1042
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:03,338
you know why why a million trees why not

1043
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:06,159
trees and shrubs and you know why not

1044
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:08,289
some a variety and the chief naturalist

1045
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:10,210
said well you know when the mayor tells

1046
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:13,329
you to plant a million trees you plant a

1047
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:15,608
million trees and and it's it's kind of

1048
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:17,859
that you know it's so this project is as

1049
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:19,960
much political as it is ecologically

1050
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:22,328
driven I would say maybe more political

1051
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,710
than ecologically driven but we were

1052
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:25,140
really interested in the questions about

1053
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,900
how do you construct an urban for

1054
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:29,518
you know what what are the criteria that

1055
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,019
you need to take into consideration and

1056
00:39:29,518 --> 00:39:33,750
we were also really interested in the

1057
00:39:31,018 --> 00:39:35,189
role of analysis and research that one

1058
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:38,250
might be able to do was enough

1059
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:41,190
coordination upfront on you know seed

1060
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:44,880
source the influence of politics and

1061
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:46,588
budget on on performance the the issue

1062
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,380
of parts maintenance practices and how

1063
00:39:46,588 --> 00:39:50,849
that influences designed the whole

1064
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,220
question that New York City has been

1065
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:54,990
asking about community boards and kind

1066
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:57,868
of discrepancies ins in terms of

1067
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:59,818
community board canopy cover and then

1068
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:01,680
local questions about public parks and

1069
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:03,630
urban forests about things like species

1070
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:04,949
richness and the value of species

1071
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:08,099
richness over how to deal with invasive

1072
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:09,719
species etcetera so there are lots of

1073
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:12,660
questions to ask so the project was

1074
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:15,149
actually rather large it was a it's it

1075
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:16,889
was a combination of citywide how to

1076
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:19,170
plant you know million trees across the

1077
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:21,838
city and in this case we were the

1078
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:23,068
project was split between the New York

1079
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:26,690
restoration project is doing

1080
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:29,489
implementation on private land and

1081
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:33,778
street trees and the Parks Department

1082
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:35,818
doing work with with us on public park

1083
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:37,230
land so we're really looking only a

1084
00:40:35,818 --> 00:40:38,838
public park land not at street trees

1085
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:42,298
which is a fundamentally different

1086
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:44,880
draught set of drivers but we looked at

1087
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:46,469
dominant vegetation and pH and moisture

1088
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,509
levels is a way of categorizing land

1089
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:51,118
types and we had decided early on that

1090
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:52,949
we would identify in the areas with a

1091
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,630
lot of invasive species then we would

1092
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:56,460
replace those with forests because one

1093
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:58,680
of our dilemmas was if we're planting

1094
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,199
dense forests four feet on center across

1095
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:04,288
the city what's that going to do to the

1096
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,210
state of public access and you know Park

1097
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:09,630
Man and so we thought it would be

1098
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:10,528
politically strong to propose replacing

1099
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,440
invasives and there are a lot of

1100
00:41:10,528 --> 00:41:14,608
invasives in New York so you know we

1101
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,950
developed a series of invasive

1102
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:19,798
management strategies for the project

1103
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:21,058
that we're all pretty intensive and

1104
00:41:19,798 --> 00:41:25,079
these were these were a kind of

1105
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:26,579
combination of research ideas coupled

1106
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,730
with the parks department natural

1107
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:31,048
resources group which is a sub group

1108
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,389
within the parks department is a very

1109
00:41:31,048 --> 00:41:35,619
unusual and sophisticated group of

1110
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:37,150
practitioners that

1111
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:39,009
have been doing this kind of work at

1112
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:42,010
least at a smaller scale for about two

1113
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:44,170
decades and then we came up with a

1114
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:47,380
series of species palates depending on

1115
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:51,280
the alkalinity alkalinity the hydrology

1116
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:53,530
of the soils and we had this process of

1117
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,690
site analysis or site density ssin which

1118
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:58,180
is really a parks management practice a

1119
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,869
fairly rapid assessment of what's what's

1120
00:41:58,179 --> 00:42:02,769
on the ground

1121
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:04,389
oops sorry so the way that we made this

1122
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:05,949
work because we started talking about

1123
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:08,230
research as a component of the design

1124
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:10,389
from early on from the first actually

1125
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:13,240
from our response in the RFP and the

1126
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:15,009
first several meetings but meeting after

1127
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:17,169
meeting we would bring up this idea of

1128
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:19,330
research as a component you know of the

1129
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,940
of the process and there were you know

1130
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:23,650
there was conversations like you know we

1131
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:26,710
don't necessarily know what the benefits

1132
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,970
of soil amendments are gonna be whether

1133
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,460
whether it's gonna be more beneficial

1134
00:42:27,969 --> 00:42:31,569
for the plants that we planted over time

1135
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,579
or whether it's going to actually

1136
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:35,980
increase invasive species recruitment

1137
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:39,400
patterns and you know we're not quite

1138
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:42,219
sure what's better or you know questions

1139
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,769
about about species richness you know

1140
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:45,969
whether or not it's but it's going to be

1141
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,500
whether or not we'll have more survival

1142
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:49,389
if we plant a higher diversity of

1143
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,090
species or less you know so there were

1144
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:54,219
certain things that we were uncertain

1145
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:57,250
about and the parks department was

1146
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:58,809
concerned about those issues but they

1147
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,219
had they were in this role where they

1148
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:03,099
had incomplete information and it had to

1149
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:05,230
make choices so we decided to frame the

1150
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:07,539
research questions around the parks

1151
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:10,210
management assumptions where there's

1152
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:12,279
debated topics in the literature but the

1153
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:14,710
parks department has to take action and

1154
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,140
so we essentially developed a series of

1155
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:22,150
research questions that this it builds

1156
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:23,679
on the flow of knowledge with the sorry

1157
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:26,200
the biodiversity an ecosystem

1158
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:28,539
functioning literature so if this here

1159
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:31,119
is a representative of the BEF

1160
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:33,489
literature and basically that

1161
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,429
information it has made its way into the

1162
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:37,779
public realm through a variety of means

1163
00:43:36,429 --> 00:43:40,359
but let's say here you co system

1164
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:42,400
services as a concept so ecosystem

1165
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,010
services comes forward and it embodies

1166
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,539
the

1167
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:48,630
information and debated topics within

1168
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:51,420
BEF literature where there are a lot of

1169
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:55,140
debates about the value of species

1170
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:56,849
richness etc this information then makes

1171
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:59,759
its way right to the policymakers so

1172
00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:02,940
there's an idea that that that by

1173
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,840
increasing canopy in an urban

1174
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,210
environment that you're going to

1175
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,579
increase ecological value and part of

1176
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:11,159
this influence the urban forest Sciences

1177
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:14,699
where the u4 model for example and other

1178
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:18,149
models are used to in take information

1179
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:20,009
in but you know they look at for example

1180
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:22,289
they do for model doesn't incorporate

1181
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:24,600
species interactions which may be one of

1182
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:26,579
the fundamental aspect of how this force

1183
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:27,929
is going to perform over time so there's

1184
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:29,699
a number of assumptions that make their

1185
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:31,500
way into the u4 model but nonetheless

1186
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:33,779
that influences decision-making about

1187
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,070
how many trees to plant and about what

1188
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,690
the benefits of these trees are going to

1189
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,340
provide from a green infrastructure

1190
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:42,030
standpoint and a canopy standpoint for

1191
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:44,070
the urban environment so policymakers

1192
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:45,720
then direct the Parks Department to

1193
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,100
plant a million trees the parks

1194
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:48,629
department particularly the natural

1195
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:51,059
resources group which I mentioned have

1196
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:53,190
experience planting trees over the last

1197
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:54,570
20 years and so they are able to take

1198
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,000
that on as an initiative and move

1199
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:59,460
forward with it as an agenda but what's

1200
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,719
missing is or what's happening is a lot

1201
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,909
of the assumptions here are getting

1202
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:04,829
embedded in the process and so what we

1203
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:07,199
were trying to do at the you know now

1204
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:10,529
the Yui D lab is to link this together

1205
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,449
again by developing the the million

1206
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:17,820
trees project as a research project as a

1207
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:19,349
long-term research project so these are

1208
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:21,809
two sites so we not only did we do

1209
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,690
citywide implementation but we also

1210
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:26,429
identified pilot sites where we could

1211
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:29,070
develop large-scale research as a

1212
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:30,989
component we were worried about the slow

1213
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:33,059
pace of the citywide implementation and

1214
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:34,529
the variability across sites in the city

1215
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:36,750
and we wanted to have a couple discrete

1216
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:39,420
sites where we had a lot of replication

1217
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:42,420
for research this is the old Queens fair

1218
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:44,670
there's Willa Lake here tom is doing

1219
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,700
work on Willow Lake now in this area as

1220
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:51,090
you mentioned earlier and here it is

1221
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:53,389
there the MTA are adjacent this is

1222
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:55,910
actually a pretty interesting

1223
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:58,489
hydrologically modified in urban

1224
00:45:55,909 --> 00:45:59,960
condition where I was in a I was talking

1225
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,130
the parks department about the notion we

1226
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,650
were talking about the notion of using

1227
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:07,009
this as a coastal adaptation management

1228
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:09,858
site because there's tide gates and in

1229
00:46:07,009 --> 00:46:11,059
it floods it turns out there's a this is

1230
00:46:09,858 --> 00:46:14,389
what I've heard that there's a putt-putt

1231
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:17,710
owner just just below that is is the

1232
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:19,969
obstacle to negotiating trying to

1233
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:21,259
reconstruct her to use this as a coastal

1234
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:22,818
adaptation just to show you some of the

1235
00:46:21,259 --> 00:46:24,769
local politics that can get in the way

1236
00:46:22,818 --> 00:46:26,929
but I'm going to talk today more about

1237
00:46:24,768 --> 00:46:28,578
cocina which is located here that all

1238
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:30,348
the World's Fair is right there so it's

1239
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:32,509
actually a pretty interesting linear

1240
00:46:30,349 --> 00:46:37,548
ecosystem and actually Queens Botanical

1241
00:46:32,509 --> 00:46:42,139
Garden is adjacent okay so this is the

1242
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:43,788
site and basically it's actually one of

1243
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:46,098
the largest community gardens in the or

1244
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:48,019
the largest I think in New York City and

1245
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:49,880
there's a hospital here at Queens

1246
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:51,558
Botanical Garden east/west International

1247
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,420
School and what we've done is we've

1248
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:55,940
embedded these a series of research

1249
00:46:53,420 --> 00:47:00,559
plots throughout the park land and we

1250
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:02,659
part of our agenda was to was part of

1251
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,190
our goal was how do you design parkland

1252
00:47:02,659 --> 00:47:06,980
that can accommodate research as a

1253
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:09,619
component of the design and and and and

1254
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,179
be part of them and be something that is

1255
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:15,798
bought into or accepted within the

1256
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:17,808
public context and so basically the

1257
00:47:15,798 --> 00:47:19,639
strategy was where the research plots

1258
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:21,109
were surrounding it we designed what I

1259
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:22,759
call the cluster planting which was

1260
00:47:21,108 --> 00:47:24,920
essentially intended to modulate the

1261
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:26,690
grid of the trees and then outside of

1262
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,539
that I actually developed what I call

1263
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,679
the picturesque style which goes back to

1264
00:47:29,539 --> 00:47:32,239
the earlier discussions that I was

1265
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:34,368
having about whether or not my own

1266
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:37,639
debate in my naturalistic designer or

1267
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:39,858
not well ultimately the picturesque it

1268
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:44,389
served as a kind of Trojan horse for the

1269
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:46,159
research plots so the interpretation was

1270
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:49,969
okay this is a picturesque style it's a

1271
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:51,440
typical typical urban parkland design so

1272
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:52,969
there weren't really many issues with it

1273
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,759
it was only about two weeks before we

1274
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:58,278
actually planted the trees staging was

1275
00:47:55,759 --> 00:48:01,400
completed we were on site trees were

1276
00:47:58,278 --> 00:48:02,389
there that the the parts manager and I

1277
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,410
turned to each other and she said no

1278
00:48:02,389 --> 00:48:05,239
what do we mean by the picturesque

1279
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:05,989
exactly and then we actually sat down

1280
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:07,880
and talked about

1281
00:48:05,989 --> 00:48:09,949
fifteen feet on center or 25 feet you

1282
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,769
know some sort of arrange and we also

1283
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:15,819
planted la trees along pathways and

1284
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:18,739
desire lines and along recreational

1285
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:21,460
areas like mothballs fields to

1286
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:24,399
essentially stitch to create a kind of

1287
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:28,220
more mature landscape that the research

1288
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:31,099
plantings which were you know small at

1289
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:32,779
the time and grow into so part of this

1290
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:34,400
was intentional as a design part of it

1291
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,619
was designed as a research project and

1292
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,780
we not manipulated so we had soil

1293
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:41,660
amendment those soil amendment we had

1294
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:43,880
high diversity low diversity and we also

1295
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:46,670
planted an understory vegetation versus

1296
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:50,599
no understory so we have seven you know

1297
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:52,820
7 by 8 factorial with 56 plots and we

1298
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:55,159
went through and did a series of

1299
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:57,680
sampling and vegetation biomass studies

1300
00:48:55,159 --> 00:49:01,399
etc to develop a better baseline data

1301
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:03,379
and now we're in the process of looking

1302
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,610
at the second stage so one of the things

1303
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,920
that we've been learning from this

1304
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:08,599
design experiment which follows a model

1305
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,420
that I'm calling build it and they will

1306
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:12,589
come which is used in a variety of means

1307
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:14,358
but essentially if you build a good

1308
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:16,970
research project in an urban context

1309
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:18,889
with a lot of replication then the idea

1310
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:20,599
is will it attracts other scientists to

1311
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:24,379
come and do their own research on this

1312
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:26,750
site one that is the example of the

1313
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:30,170
adaptive experimentation from ASU where

1314
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:33,079
the scientists there identified the

1315
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:35,480
circle these circles that were part of a

1316
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:37,219
domestic housing military housing

1317
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,630
project that were all similar sized and

1318
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:40,699
shaped and they had the same number of

1319
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:42,650
houses around them so it's an example of

1320
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:44,449
a kind of identifying a research

1321
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:47,599
artefact in an urban context that you

1322
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:49,159
can that it has enough replication that

1323
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,960
you can set up an experiment on it

1324
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:55,339
so this is a different approach where

1325
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:57,409
you embed you kind of virally embed

1326
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:59,470
yourself in the design process and you

1327
00:49:57,409 --> 00:50:03,079
construct these research projects for

1328
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:05,449
for the purpose of analysis and giving

1329
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:08,569
people opportunities the downside to

1330
00:50:05,449 --> 00:50:10,159
this is that you you get the the funding

1331
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:12,080
for the experimental design in the

1332
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:13,670
experimental construction we're all

1333
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,960
essentially paid for through public

1334
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:17,059
funding and by the way the the

1335
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,289
contractor who was fantastic was it was

1336
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:20,748
a great way to build an expiry

1337
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:22,249
to have a contractor and his entire crew

1338
00:50:20,748 --> 00:50:24,318
go out and sort of established this

1339
00:50:22,248 --> 00:50:25,639
whole thing but it's the second half of

1340
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:27,338
the design experiment that I'm still

1341
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,568
it's still sort of a struggle because

1342
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:31,308
what you have is this constructed

1343
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:32,989
experiment but you don't but the funding

1344
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:34,999
is not there for the monitoring

1345
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:36,679
component so then you're going out and

1346
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:39,288
trying to essentially sell the project

1347
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:41,660
to different agencies to fund the second

1348
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:43,400
half of this experimental setup or this

1349
00:50:41,659 --> 00:50:45,409
experimental research so we're in that

1350
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,579
phase now looking at questions like are

1351
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:51,588
constructive Native communities and

1352
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:53,269
urban landscape sustainable you know in

1353
00:50:51,588 --> 00:50:54,708
questioning whether they're really

1354
00:50:53,268 --> 00:50:56,328
whether they're resilient in the face of

1355
00:50:54,708 --> 00:51:00,318
a variety of urban stressors we've

1356
00:50:56,329 --> 00:51:02,298
identified that that you know drought is

1357
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:06,558
an issue that's already taken place on

1358
00:51:02,298 --> 00:51:07,759
our site vandalism is pretty common as

1359
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,650
students that are in the schools

1360
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:12,858
adjacent like to break the trees and use

1361
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:15,139
them as for sword-fighting you know the

1362
00:51:12,858 --> 00:51:16,788
there's some really interesting dynamics

1363
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:19,278
for example we've spent you know two

1364
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:19,999
years eradicating or trying to eradicate

1365
00:51:19,278 --> 00:51:21,498
mugwort

1366
00:51:19,998 --> 00:51:24,228
and it turns out that the Asian

1367
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:26,568
population living in this area like to

1368
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:28,938
spread mugwort because it's used in for

1369
00:51:26,568 --> 00:51:31,938
tea and for I think for sushi or other

1370
00:51:28,938 --> 00:51:34,938
kinds of food so it's actually this kind

1371
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:38,558
of you know back and forth between you

1372
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:41,808
know that's going on in urban ecology so

1373
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:45,069
the project itself included a wide range

1374
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:47,359
of stakeholders and and part of this is

1375
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:50,028
the role of the design experiment is

1376
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:53,449
bringing the agenda of stakeholder a in

1377
00:51:50,028 --> 00:51:55,369
alignment or as a way of furthering the

1378
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:57,679
goals of stakeholder B for example so

1379
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:59,479
you know the parks department was really

1380
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:01,608
looking for green infrastructure and

1381
00:51:59,478 --> 00:52:03,918
biodiversity and habitat and they had a

1382
00:52:01,608 --> 00:52:04,518
capital investment component that was

1383
00:52:03,918 --> 00:52:06,199
going into it

1384
00:52:04,518 --> 00:52:08,178
meanwhile the scientists were looking

1385
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:10,278
for ways of testing management

1386
00:52:08,179 --> 00:52:13,608
assumptions in establishing manipulative

1387
00:52:10,278 --> 00:52:15,228
experiments to study these systems in

1388
00:52:13,608 --> 00:52:16,248
the you know the parks and recreation

1389
00:52:15,228 --> 00:52:17,629
natural resources group are really

1390
00:52:16,248 --> 00:52:19,578
looking for evidence-based management

1391
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:22,369
and so they're looking for a kind of

1392
00:52:19,579 --> 00:52:25,729
quick analysis and and invasive species

1393
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:27,499
control practices so and finally the

1394
00:52:25,728 --> 00:52:29,208
people like the Queen's Botanical Garden

1395
00:52:27,498 --> 00:52:29,469
who are somewhat involved as well as in

1396
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,299
the same

1397
00:52:29,469 --> 00:52:33,069
Hawthorne middle school are looking for

1398
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,930
research and education opportunities

1399
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:36,609
ways of getting students involved in the

1400
00:52:34,929 --> 00:52:38,469
process to understand their environments

1401
00:52:36,608 --> 00:52:40,449
I talked about this already a little bit

1402
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:42,269
the idea of the the research plot

1403
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:44,348
adjacent to the cluster and the cluster

1404
00:52:42,269 --> 00:52:46,179
adjacent to the picturesque and the

1405
00:52:44,349 --> 00:52:48,099
picturesque adjacent to the LA these are

1406
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:51,279
just sort of the design drawings that

1407
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:52,750
were used to to negotiate the process

1408
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,630
and then this is an example of the plot

1409
00:52:52,750 --> 00:53:00,699
itself and the way we set it up and then

1410
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:03,160
the the research plot itself was

1411
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:05,379
originally a grid and even though the

1412
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:07,299
parks department plants have planted

1413
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:09,789
several hundred thousand trees in a four

1414
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:12,250
foot on center grid when the when the

1415
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:15,219
when we sent them the grid they were

1416
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:17,949
troubled by kind of the way it looked

1417
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:19,989
and so they wanted us to kind of or they

1418
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:22,059
gave some push back to rethink how we

1419
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:23,679
were organizing the species and what we

1420
00:53:22,059 --> 00:53:26,380
were what our intentions were and so we

1421
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:27,460
thought more about it and in the you

1422
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:31,300
know the parks department they liked to

1423
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:33,280
plant in patches and and we came we

1424
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,140
started taking on that idea and then we

1425
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,000
came up with what we had actually called

1426
00:53:35,139 --> 00:53:39,338
the naturalistic plot which was

1427
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,510
essentially an organization of trees in

1428
00:53:39,338 --> 00:53:45,460
patches or quadrats of similar species

1429
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:47,230
and in these kind of clumps and then we

1430
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:49,119
reorganized the shrubs and herbaceous on

1431
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:51,280
a different alignment to sort of break

1432
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,539
down the grid and what we actually

1433
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,660
realized was it became a better

1434
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:58,029
experimental set up because we were able

1435
00:53:55,659 --> 00:54:00,429
to ask questions at the micro plot scale

1436
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:03,130
where we were we're now sampling in each

1437
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:05,169
one of these quadrats and assessing the

1438
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:07,119
function or the changes in soil

1439
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:09,338
microbial community as well as tree

1440
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,869
species performance of these local

1441
00:54:09,338 --> 00:54:12,759
clumped groups and able to compare in

1442
00:54:10,869 --> 00:54:14,079
Colombia - Colombia so it turned out to

1443
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,210
be one of these examples of a win-win

1444
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,789
situation which is sometimes hard to

1445
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:20,920
achieve these are the plots here this is

1446
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:26,050
this is the I'm working with mark

1447
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:29,010
Bradford who is a soil ecologist at Yale

1448
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:31,269
also and so he's really been active in

1449
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:33,609
analysis of microbial community we're

1450
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:36,019
also working with rich Hallett from the

1451
00:54:33,608 --> 00:54:38,389
US Forest Service on

1452
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:40,610
chlorophyll and fluorescence to look at

1453
00:54:38,389 --> 00:54:43,329
as a method of assessing tree

1454
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:45,250
performance and tree health over time

1455
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:47,929
and we've actually found some

1456
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:49,429
preliminary information at least in this

1457
00:54:47,929 --> 00:54:52,940
box plot indicating that there are

1458
00:54:49,429 --> 00:54:55,789
differences between species on site and

1459
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:57,920
then we're we have this this is kind of

1460
00:54:55,789 --> 00:55:00,230
I wouldn't call idea collaboration but

1461
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,000
these outreach programs with local

1462
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:04,369
schoolchildren who are coming out and

1463
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,860
we're trying to work with the parks

1464
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:10,190
department and the school to come up

1465
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:12,710
with research that would is doable on a

1466
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:13,760
short-term and meaningful to students so

1467
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:17,449
we're looking at things like cover

1468
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:20,930
boards as a way of setting up a sampling

1469
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:22,669
practice for local school communities to

1470
00:55:20,929 --> 00:55:23,899
do their analysis so you know I'm

1471
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:25,880
thinking I think of this as a kind of

1472
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:28,809
applied urban ecology that has a

1473
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:31,910
research aesthetic and it's you know

1474
00:55:28,809 --> 00:55:33,230
designing an experimental landscape and

1475
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:34,849
so I you know to me I think it's

1476
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:39,010
starting to bridge these fields of

1477
00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:41,569
design and science as an approach and

1478
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:43,190
you know in part of it as I mentioned

1479
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:44,420
before is the role of implementation and

1480
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:47,389
getting in actually building these

1481
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:50,030
things so that you can start to document

1482
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:52,009
all the pitfalls and the challenges of

1483
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,870
implementation over time just what we've

1484
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:55,460
been doing we one of my students

1485
00:55:53,869 --> 00:55:57,349
recently did a lifecycle assessment of

1486
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:01,159
the project because essentially the

1487
00:55:57,349 --> 00:56:03,079
contractor kept notes on a weekly basis

1488
00:56:01,159 --> 00:56:04,940
which stacked about this high of

1489
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:07,460
everything that they did from the start

1490
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:10,960
and so he looked at the different stages

1491
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:12,829
of the process and how that impact

1492
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,619
ecological function from a lifecycle

1493
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:18,049
assessment and found that the that the

1494
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:20,109
treats the tree plantation process was

1495
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:22,670
really the biggest consumer of energy

1496
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:23,780
but invasive me invasive management

1497
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:26,000
although you can't me see that number

1498
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:30,470
for some reason it was also pretty high

1499
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:33,429
it's a black one and and and so you know

1500
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:35,359
we were his analysis suggested that that

1501
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:38,239
basically it's going to take somewhere

1502
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:39,890
between 11 to 41 years to pay back all

1503
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:41,659
the energy input that went into

1504
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:43,309
implementing the million trees project

1505
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:47,049
at least on Cocina if that's a case

1506
00:56:43,309 --> 00:56:49,960
study so yeah this is one of the are we

1507
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:53,950
I think being made about urban parkland

1508
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:55,059
a forestation practices but what some of

1509
00:56:53,949 --> 00:56:57,159
the things that this doesn't take into

1510
00:56:55,059 --> 00:56:59,019
account are species interactions which

1511
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:01,779
is a kind of important one and a whole

1512
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:04,900
range of social human factors you know

1513
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:08,980
that the value of having a canopy or an

1514
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:10,059
urban forest in the city I've been

1515
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:12,280
interested Tom and I've talked about

1516
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:14,230
this before of looking at you know

1517
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,150
because of the Asian longhorn beetle and

1518
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,980
some of the other constraints on the

1519
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:19,480
plant that our plant palette options

1520
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:23,110
were limited and so we planted a lot of

1521
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:25,179
Oaks and Oaks gave off volatile organic

1522
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:27,160
compounds planting them adjacent to

1523
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:31,119
roadways you know you could get some

1524
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:33,309
mixing of exhaust with these the VOCs

1525
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,139
and so there's basic questions about

1526
00:57:33,309 --> 00:57:36,549
what it is that we're doing and what the

1527
00:57:35,139 --> 00:57:37,750
implications of what we're doing they're

1528
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,610
going to have over time in terms of

1529
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:42,489
ecosystem services or ecosystem benefits

1530
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:43,809
that really need to be evaluated but as

1531
00:57:42,489 --> 00:57:45,429
Tom can attest it's a kind of a

1532
00:57:43,809 --> 00:57:47,710
difficult effort to try to understand

1533
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:51,849
the turbulent dynamics of that

1534
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:55,139
environment was okay so I wanted to

1535
00:57:51,849 --> 00:58:00,269
briefly how am i doing on time

1536
00:57:55,139 --> 00:58:00,269
over then let me pull let me in there

1537
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:18,490
this has been a production of Cornell

1538
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:18,490
University on the web at Cornell edu
