51
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,359
questions I get as I talk to different

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,239
people we're going to try to dig into a

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,760
few of those specific things we go

54
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,920

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,598
know that talk to me we can I can talk

59
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,878
about a lot of different things that we

60
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:31,759
try and lots of different just lots of

61
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,280
different knowledge on a lot of

62
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:39,759
different things um so yeah this is us

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,439
no Ry or no actually it's I tell

64
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,000
everybody there one soy beads but

65
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,120
because of the question we had earlier

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,919
about raising sunflowers in no till Ry I

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,280
will admit I'm actually no telling

68
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:54,359
sunflowers in this field and it was a

69
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,400
total failure and so and and what we

70
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,879
found was so we actually came back it

71
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,480
was rep about a month later what we

72
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,639
found was slug

73
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:07,000
like sunflowers better than they like

74
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:09,199
corn and they like soy we actually total

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,719
random made two passes with soybeans on

76
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,560
the other side of the field because we

77
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,318
still had beans left and then and the

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,799
beans root perfect to the rad and the

79
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:20,839
next we're over we might have had 5%

80
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:24,640
stand and I've never seen slugs take a

81
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,360
crop as fast or as big slugs as so my

82
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,479
take on that question we had earlier

83
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,239
about sunflowers was that we believe

84
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:34,560
it's a slug issue so what

85
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,799
we all right so moving on this is

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,759
overview of our home Farm I'm actually

87
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,400
the third generation at my father uh we

88
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:46,519
actually U looked about going organic

89
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,879
back in the 80s um I when I was 5 years

90
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,080
old one of the first organic farms in

91
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,840
Ohio U some of you may have heard of the

92
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,200
spray Brothers Rex and Howard spray

93
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,079
they're bur Ohio I remember going there

94
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,719
with my father on field days 5 years old

95
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,480
and seeing this Farm and I always

96
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,919
thought was kind of odd they for game

97
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:08,919
forers with the last name s a y that was

98
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,318
just a weird weird I guess but uh it's

99
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:14,878
kind of neat that we almost did that but

100
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:18,759
we didn't make that jump and then about

101
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:21,680
12 13 years ago uh we decided to uh

102
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,000
begin our journey into organic and U

103
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,000
never look back and basically our entire

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,959
certified so um like I said father son

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
operation um my my wife Nicole has has

106
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,038
made a trip over here with me we have

107
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,680
four boys at home uh the oldest is 16

108
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:39,159
the youngest is nine uh they all love

109
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,439
the farm whether they come back to the

110
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,919
farm I want to make sure that they at

111
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,478
least have the opportunity if they want

112
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:47,439
to U but they it's it's great they enjoy

113
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,439
your organic farming part of it and

114
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,600
they're very it's interesting to see

115
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,439
them talk to their friends and go places

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
as we point out organic foods and things

117
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,319
so it's really to have that younger

118
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,439
generation coming off um so we own about

119
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:05,079
5 acres in there in or way County and

120
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:06,439
then we ran another 2,000 acres I say 40

121
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:08,839
different land owners actually added up

122
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,839
the other day it's actually 44 uh

123
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:14,599
because of where we live we have a lot

124
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:16,599
of our R get sold and split up and so

125
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,960
the last year we actually added didn't

126
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,800
add any more Acres but we added four

127
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,478
more land owners one of the Farms sold

128
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,400
and split into four pieces so we deal

129
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:28,038
with that on a regular basis is a

130
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,839
struggle and organic that part um but we

131
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:32,959
have tried to make that work we are

132
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,638
spread out over about 25 miles and uh we

133
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,038
do see to have always have ground in

134
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,360
transition as we rent more land so as we

135
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,318
rent New Farms say start that process we

136
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,080
always started with

137
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,479
py there's our farm mission statement it

138
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,639
just basically says that what we believe

139
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:52,478
in and that's what we try that's that's

140
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:55,600
why we

141
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,478
there so these are our props he read

142
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,240
these I'm not going to go through each

143
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:02,680
one of them but they're there we're

144
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,680
going to talk about most of

145
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:09,719
them um this is actually a picture of my

146
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,080
grandfather on 14 I believe fing way

147
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,840
back in the I don't even know should

148
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,519
when that was from but I thought throw

149
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:19,598
that up there these are our crop

150
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:21,000
rotations and they're very you know

151
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:23,800
that's like the hardest thing that when

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,120
I do my OSB and we're working on

153
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,240
currently on regenerative Organic

154
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,319
certification they ask it's like they

155
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,960
want this inste what is your what is

156
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,360
your location well you know all depends

157
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,519
and uh there's so many things because we

158
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,639
ra so many different crops there's so

159
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:42,598
many different variation on this but for

160
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,240
instance we are in the hay business I've

161
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:47,598
been in the hay business since I came

162
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,918
back from Ohio State onto the farm that

163
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:52,918
was how I got started one point we had

164
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,839
1400 Acres of hay we sell hay we we live

165
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,680
in the number one Dairy County in Ohio

166
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,279
we sell hay locally most of our hay

167
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,400
saves with the good of home we are

168
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,239
really fortunate on top of the fact that

169
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,279
we live in a great Dairy County we also

170
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,079
live in the second largest concentration

171
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:13,000
of organic valley daes are within 50 mil

172
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:15,198
the first largest most so those daries

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,399
that are grazing all need to be head all

174
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,400
the way and we have

175
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,759
fantastic so we'll talk a little about

176
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,198
the hay the hay is basically the basis

177
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,280
for all of our prop rotations except a

178
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:33,759
few fields that just can't really

179
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,839
ground but we like to go P corn that's

180
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:40,280
our simpol for addiction is that is that

181
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:41,758
also big County yes yes yeah so County

182
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,719
holes county is the South that's one of

183
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,520
the largest populations Bish in the

184
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,520
world um so we have

185
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:57,239
Landers um so for us one of the easiest

186
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,240
things to go after hay and then a lot of

187
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,639
times we will go into spring week we'll

188
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,079
talk about a little later with a clover

189
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,960
under seated um and then we actually

190
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,120
will go from Spring week to Winter week

191
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,878
sometimes and then back to Hay pens if

192
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,240
we want to put you know we'll talk about

193
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,439
sunflower so there's it's just such a a

194
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,319
very rotation so there's not one

195
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:24,399
rotation I figured that works perfect on

196
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:27,240
every field it's kind of f specific and

197
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:30,560
one thing we will talk about when we get

198
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:34,240
to the no soy um about

199
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,958
why we don't do very

200
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,399
much oh so nutrients um these are our

201
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:43,158
main main nutrients we're a big believer

202
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,759
in gyps uh we actually have an open

203
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:48,399
standing order with the Trum company

204
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:51,000
that brings us M gypsum from up up in

205
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,600
Michigan pretty much year round and Dums

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,720
it under storage because we put 500

207
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,159
every acre every single year no matter

208
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,240
what CRS in there we want we are trying

209
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,719
to soluble levels and soluble

210
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,639
nutrient levels in our soils as high as

211
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,800
we can makes we we found makes we

212
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:13,240
control easier so we have

213
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,799
in the other product obviously chicken

214
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,720
we spread a lot of chicken another

215
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,479
unique thing about our area we don't own

216
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,600
any chickens on our farm but the farest

217
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,800
we call chicken from chicken house to

218
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,560
field is four months so we have deals

219
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,759
with many many different chicken Growers

220
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:33,119
and 75% of that manur is

221
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,600
organic but we have a lot of agreements

222
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,839
with these houses that we keep them

223
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,079
cleaned out they Pile in the end we get

224
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:43,320
rid of them immediately where to pil or

225
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:45,479
storage and spr so we're really

226
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,040
fortunate this other product here is a

227
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,039
newer product for us it's bone meal it

228
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,519
is produced locally there as well it

229
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,319
actually produced about miles away um

230
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,399
comes with chickens and it's super high

231
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,879
in nitrogen and it's super high in

232
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,600
phosphorus and calcium

233
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,399
the nitrogen is why we're using it um we

234
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,399
are using us to use chili nitrate I

235
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,480
personally spies chili nitrate because

236
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,919
it's sodium nitrate putting sodium on

237
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,839
the soil is not good for soil though

238
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,439
okay so we need to be careful how we use

239
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,240
that the other reason I don't like julan

240
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,040
nitrate personal opinion and I have no

241
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,720
basis for this other than I know it's an

242
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:25,199
imported thing that comes to chil we

243
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
don't know you know someday they might

244
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,360
come out and say oh look there were

245
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,320
children finding that do we want to be

246
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,120
respon I don't want to be respons

247
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,120
responsible for that or something go

248
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:40,240
ahead soorry

249
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,079
um so um no on the gypsum we try we do

250
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,480
not fly gypsum in the fall because it

251
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,879
will Leach so we uh we want to keep that

252
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,560
we try to do all in the spring in the

253
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,720
sense in situation of hay we do

254
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,278
immediately after first cutting and um

255
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,680
only place that gets qualified would be

256
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,679
on the winter crops like wheat something

257
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,559
like that everything else is

258
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:04,000
spr um or case of corn soy beans we try

259
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,958
to get it on in the top inch of the soil

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,360
so it'll be right before maybe that last

261
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:11,879
pillage pass or right on because we want

262
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,720
our goal is to get soluble calcium top

263
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,679
of the soil half inch the soil as high

264
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,759
as possible so that's kind of nutrients

265
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:24,399
we use there's how we spread gypsum bone

266
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,078
meal we spread just put the standard U

267
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,120
fertilizer line spreader combination

268
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,638
spreader that they both go through there

269
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,600
fantastic um

270
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,440
and then we do do some foler feeding and

271
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,519
liquid in Rose cell I used to do a lot

272
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,959
more foler feeding than I do now I don't

273
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,679
see as big of benefits I think part of

274
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,319
that is because we as we been in organic

275
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:46,078
more our soil has become more

276
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,000
biologically active and we just don't

277
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,559
see the

278
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,679
benefit I still believe in putting an

279
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:55,679
inro fertilizer though um I guess start

280
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:58,439
with we um like said that's what we do

281
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,838
oner when we do it we don't always do it

282
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,560
though um we see the biggest benefit on

283
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,160
small gpes in raising protein levels in

284
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:09,159
we that's where we see a real big

285
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:11,519
benefit this nutrition is a biological

286
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:14,000
that is improved in organic production

287
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,919
and while it will work in corn and I've

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,919
seen seen it working for we see it work

289
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,519
on a consistent basis in Smalls I I've

290
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,360
never had a year where it has not paid

291
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,399
us back small especially since once

292
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,360
again protein is nitrogen you want high

293
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,278
protein in your small grains and your

294
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,440
wheat you to have

295
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:36,439
highog so but in row we want to get our

296
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,959
corn and soybeans ands off a really

297
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,880
quick start we want them to beat the

298
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,078
weeds out of the ground you know as fast

299
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:45,399
as they can get out of the ground so we

300
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:49,159
do use inro um that's what we're using

301
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,879
the Dr o usually and some of

302
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:54,078
the

303
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:57,278
products this SP 120 you see towards the

304
00:12:54,078 --> 00:13:00,198
bottom there that's a biul it's bana

305
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,000
found out about this about

306
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:04,479
when kind of when the first came out of

307
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,879
it the company approached me hey we have

308
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,519
this product you know might be interest

309
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:12,399
we we deal a lot of in

310
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,078
apple they said you might try it we

311
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,039
don't know we don't have the studies

312
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,439
done yet might help with that it also

313
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:20,639
helps with just root health and things

314
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,880
like that so we use it first year we

315
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,159
have 10 bu increase on now I don't get

316
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,679
that here some years it's we get an

317
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:30,559
increase some years we don't but since

318
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:33,799
we started using that six years ago

319
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,599
we've not had any had any issues with

320
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:39,879
bom toxin or aot toxins on any of crops

321
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,320
of so we use it on everything and it's

322
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:43,919
seed applied or can also be put liquid

323
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,000
on on the

324
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,360
to right we use NE oil then in the row

325
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,159
just for you know C corn maggot control

326
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,879
things like that we only try to use it

327
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:57,360
in soil in the

328
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,679
row um so I'll go through some of the

329
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,278
tillage things you're going to see a lot

330
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:04,159
of coming up here and things we do still

331
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:06,278
do some old work F I found the best way

332
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:09,159
to take a Hayfield that's been in hay

333
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:11,958
out of production still shallow we don't

334
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,919
like to go deeper than 6 in and we like

335
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,719
to get we like to get some growth in the

336
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,639
spring before we follow because

337
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,040
basically if you've ever heard Gary

338
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,360
Zimmer talk that's that I I believe the

339
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,599
same thing that's that's pure nitrogen

340
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,399
coming from a hay producer you know if

341
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,480
that stuffs 23 25%

342
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:33,440
protein that that secure nitrogen and

343
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,560
that is very readily available out

344
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,399
of so we let that stuff get you know

345
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:42,319
about footall maybe

346
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:44,519
that you can see our clover red clover

347
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,160
which we use after wheat FR we're

348
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:50,120
actually start SE next week way the

349
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:52,799
weather looks in the should be perfect

350
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,240
we'll do that and then we sh that in or

351
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:58,599
sometimes we will use our L as well that

352
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,240
we love our high disc but there is it's

353
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,680
so diff depend one year we'll use it a

354
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,879
whole bunch in the spring and next year

355
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:09,319
we might have wetter conditions and then

356
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,320
the they're gam very

357
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:16,879
specific so FL shreding I used to think

358
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,240
we didn't need a FL shred um you know

359
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,000
Lin we can that'll work sometimes your

360
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,480
cover crops get out of control you need

361
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,120
to get them shreded down so that that L

362
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,800
can can work better even on a pile you

363
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,600
need to get it down pile all your and

364
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:34,120
get it's not soil the other thing we

365
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,240
like to do with our clover our CR Clover

366
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,879
we try not to make that for hay because

367
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,120
I already take removing enough nutrients

368
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:44,159
off the farm making so when we have

369
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,240
Frost Clover we want to M

370
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,480
that stimulates the roots to grow and

371
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,799
put more make more nutrients put in the

372
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,839
soil so we'll actually go in every 35

373
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:57,000
days on that Clover and FL shred it

374
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,000
shred it down and then it uh yeah it

375
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,759
works really good it'll just regrow and

376
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,559
just basically like you're making off of

377
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:11,240
it ex sh soil it's

378
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:13,559
just soil next year when plan so one

379
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,720
thing we've not heard much about

380
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:19,838
today we had up a propane flame leader

381
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,120
four years ago and first couple years a

382
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,240
little scared honest first couple times

383
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,600
you flame

384
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:33,120
corn look pretty bad actually next so we

385
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:36,399
play little and U so this yeah one on

386
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,480
your left that would

387
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,399
be okay that would be within six hours

388
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,039
after maybe a little longer so looks

389
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,480
pretty bad my neighbors they all joke I

390
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,799
I like to we two and you know after

391
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,159
three days after they're like oh you

392
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,958
killed your corn then they come back and

393
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:56,958
do this like he killed his corn again

394
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:59,758
and I have one neighbor he doesn't he

395
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,719
swears like I'm out of night

396
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,640
no

397
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,600
way so that's you know within 24 hours

398
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,799
go this is usually the next day maybe

399
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:15,240
two days later this last this is five

400
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:17,918
days later so what we're trying to do is

401
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,919
basically sterilize the soil or and kill

402
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,919
all the little weeds that are just in a

403
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,360
b we don't do broadcasting is a waste I

404
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,079
have that's why I

405
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,879
have it's

406
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:34,918
easy it's hard you can't Cate corn so by

407
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:38,200
doing this we have now basically created

408
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:40,759
a we free zone right over the corner and

409
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,080
it works it is worked

410
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:45,440
fantastic and then when we get to this

411
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:48,879
stage about a week later we'll come back

412
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,960
weor we'll see later and then we'll do

413
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,000
more

414
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,159
start one thing that we found out

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,798
accidentally well sort of accidentally

416
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,400
we uh we found we found that flaming

417
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:04,679
coin at this stage actually increases

418
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,000
the G I have I would love to see

419
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,080
somebody just say but we have done two

420
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,720
side by sides two years in a row one was

421
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:14,359
on purpose second year the first time we

422
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,200
ran out of fuel and we never came back

423
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,558
and where we flain it it yield 10 better

424
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,279
there was no weed difference because it

425
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:21,359
wasn't it was in a field we didn't go

426
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,759
back because we didn't have weed

427
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,678
pressure could drive 20 miles the T fuel

428
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:28,798
for three

429
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,640
rounds and yeah it made the corns better

430
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:34,158
and we could not and and all we to this

431
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,840
one I heard I know so that said that

432
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,039
happens but we think that maybe there

433
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:40,279
something

434
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:43,000
there uh one thing I want you to see

435
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,480
though is we do have shields on on the

436
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,960
flamers some flamers out there don't

437
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,360
have shields nothing wrong with no

438
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,360
Shields the the great thing about

439
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,319
shields though is we use less we use

440
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:54,439
about four gallon per acre when when

441
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,558
we're doing tiny corn and then when we

442
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,440
get into bigger corn maybe second

443
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:02,319
Passover or we have bigger leads we

444
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,240
SI but those Shields keep the heat close

445
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,240
to the ground where you need it longer

446
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,319
so you don't have to use as much fuel so

447
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,720
it's more efficient our propane cost you

448
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:14,439
know it's

449
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,558
like gallon so it's not very

450
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,000
expensive so yeah we we have not flame

451
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:21,839
soybeans I'm a little scared too talk

452
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,200
horor stories but we do flame sunflowers

453
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,199
it works very good with sunflowers

454
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,479
and that's a little fin cation while you

455
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,679
guys are familiar with this so I don't

456
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,798
need to tell something you already know

457
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:41,120
we do we have lot equipment but we have

458
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:43,720
some other cators out here single s High

459
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:47,479
resue cators like that you can never

460
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:50,000
have cators I I fought using you find

461
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,480
them for for she you can redo them and

462
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,279
they work great because when I first got

463
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,159
became organic before we were organic I

464
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,200
was a conventional no till operation as

465
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,360
sprayer

466
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,919
12 and one of the first people that when

467
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:05,959
I got into I remember they said need to

468
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,720
have the

469
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,640
same capacity colate that you have to

470
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,640
spray now

471
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:18,558
I 10 sprayer that's a lot but he's right

472
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:20,959
and so we have we actually have enough

473
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:24,200
cators maybe not quite there but we have

474
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,240
cated 400 acres and we don't have Fields

475
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,519
our fields are like around here 400

476
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,798
acres in one day and and been done by by

477
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:36,359
govern so we have lot ofers we do but we

478
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:38,879
have tin weeders we like the tiny weed

479
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,759
basically going Elation in three days

480
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,960
after

481
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,519
planning when you have the light weeds

482
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,120
there and do that so we have the two

483
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:48,319
different time leers the regular

484
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,359
standard ones we SE with standard times

485
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,519
and we have a rotary one the rotary one

486
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,759
works great High rescue

487
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:58,918
situations the other ones are basically

488
00:20:54,759 --> 00:21:00,279
a if you matter situations and

489
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,960
and that's why we ended up with the

490
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:04,279
other because a lot of times we will end

491
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,279
up with

492
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,960
situations it does it blind situations

493
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,079
when when there's no Corner we do very

494
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,319
little high reading after the crops St

495
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:18,639
in cor I just have not have I haven't

496
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:22,319
seen the benefit and in small grains as

497
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,679
well Tor over here he told me that I had

498
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,038
time we my spring Le when I did it first

499
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:29,159
got it said you got to do that and I

500
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:30,919
went out and made two round like this is

501
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,840
you know he said don't look back so he

502
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:35,360
didn't do it and uh it didn't the Y was

503
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:39,678
no different between the two I don't

504
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,678
know maybe gu wasn't doing

505
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,200
right um so anyways um so then we're

506
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,120
going to talk drills planners stuff like

507
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,679
that we do a lot of different things um

508
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,639
I said Frost seating this is our Frost

509
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,480
seating room this is what we'll be on

510
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,640
next week um one my employees my father

511
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,200
want to run the bank doesn't hold a lot

512
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,159
cost a lot of money for that little

513
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,600
spreader and actually pay $20 Neighbors

514
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,600
on

515
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:10,199
retirement um but then we're we a lot of

516
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:13,199
cover crops so we have this 30 foot

517
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,519
drill that we do no till but but it also

518
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,679
has a big tank so when you're planting

519
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,000
small grains it's important to talk

520
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,720
about high seeding rates when you're

521
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,240
doing High seeding rates you need to

522
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,079
make sure you're not fill enough every

523
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,480
round because in some situations if

524
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:30,319
you're planting three Bush the acre uh

525
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,000
which we do uh sometimes in Ry Wheats

526
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:35,158
some that

527
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,319
we're that's 180 pound the acre even

528
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,960
with that we get 4,000 pounds in that

529
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:42,119
drill that's only like 25 acres planted

530
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,720
if we're going to plant 4 500 Acres or

531
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:47,879
something that's a lot of BU that drill

532
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:51,319
but this little smaller drill is really

533
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,840
so so we're looking at efficiency um I'm

534
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:58,158
a numbers guy I have econ degree so I

535
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,158
look at my numbers a lot um that really

536
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,840
matters

537
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,679
because I love organic farming I

538
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,359
couldn't go back to being a conventional

539
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,720
farmer but and and I believe organic

540
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:11,119
farming is by far the most sustainable

541
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,839
way to farm but if you're not making a

542
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:17,399
profit you're not get sustainable but

543
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:20,199
that's B we got

544
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,720
to so planner wise we have two different

545
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,480
planers so the big

546
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:30,480
planner that has our it actually we'll

547
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,480
talk about the dong roll in front of but

548
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,038
uh we love that for soy beans we used it

549
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,919
a little bit in corn we used to use it

550
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,798
all in corn it had all the Precision

551
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,360
planting stuff on it it's left over from

552
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:43,798
our old days so it has all the all the

553
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:48,278
great goodies this other plant I paid

554
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:50,720
$3500 for out it's somebody modifi it P

555
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:53,000
up because we have nrow you guys around

556
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,720
here but it's

557
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,400
3.9 back in the '90s our farm was allst

558
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,120
we had a six all the ne

559
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,120
was

560
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:10,918
money the

561
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,919
turn and so we are getting away put we

562
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:17,520
are leaving a 20 foot grass strip and we

563
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,278
are using 3 and corn because heav is

564
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:24,038
where we drive on

565
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:27,599
the and by even by that strip our yields

566
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:30,359
are not going down Yi are staying same

567
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,359
foot un

568
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:36,119
so that's one thing the other thing is

569
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:38,720
rtk we have all of our lines out

570
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:42,119
repeatable all our tractors have rtk

571
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,240
guides almost but they're repeatable all

572
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:48,519
tractors share share between each other

573
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,798
and it makes we control every other pass

574
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:52,519
so much

575
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,798
s but when you have to Trail planner

576
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:57,639
like that that's really hard on rolling

577
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:00,319
ground without expensive extra steering

578
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,559
and stuff like that be exact we need to

579
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:05,200
be exact I'm not talking being off an

580
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:09,158
inch is still not

581
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,759
exact oh here's a video of rolling from

582
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:15,039
the tror you may it should be close up

583
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:17,119
here just see the rollers uh earlier

584
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:20,038
there was a mention about going to a

585
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:22,239
roller that is small that is narrow so

586
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:24,119
it follows the grounds and that's why we

587
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,558
went with this we do not have big flat

588
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,918
fields we don't have you know a lot of

589
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,960
times we plant dry if we happen no tell

590
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,080
usually we do a little bit of tell it's

591
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,720
not it's not smooth out there so to get

592
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:39,918
a good G we got to have we it need to be

593
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,558
able to flex it so we really like that

594
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:46,720
we also like the way with on the planner

595
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:49,119
it rolls it it's hard to explain about

596
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,600
seeing in person but it pushes it down

597
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:54,398
right ahead so then you're not actually

598
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,278
hair pinning into the uh into the fur

599
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:59,000
with the c it kind of pushes it out of

600
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:01,159
the way the way the set of works so it

601
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,960
works really

602
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,559
slight um well it's continuous so it's

603
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,038
yeah and they use and they use hydraulic

604
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,240
down pressure so there's whole way

605
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:14,158
around it's kind of the same idea foric

606
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,120
down pressure like a no til drill and

607
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,000
then you can

608
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,519
adjust what do you use foring for

609
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,480
closing Wheels well so we're actually

610
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:25,240
just using goodel we went back to that I

611
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,440
have SP clothing wheels that I use for

612
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,240
no ta conventional for years we pled in

613
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,360
all cover problem

614
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,558
and but when we started rolling all it

615
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,918
does make a big round back a lot of

616
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:38,839
times if you get in and see if you

617
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,559
really care so we found for good that

618
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:43,678
way another trick we found planing

619
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:46,158
soybeans into this is you need to plant

620
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,000
deep and and we do that even with our

621
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,960
regular we you know say an inch deep

622
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,880
we'll plant in this situation I'll plant

623
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,840
three inches deep you know and it'll be

624
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,559
closed the slot May when you're walking

625
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:59,678
top may not look closed but the you

626
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:02,278
can't see the see it's closed down far

627
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,278
enough but it'll

628
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:10,158
come so there's our beans just coming up

629
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,840
not a perfect stand um but it'll be

630
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,799
enough that we'll get a good yeld that

631
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,599
you see there's some weeds it's not a

632
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,798
it's not a perfect situation and that's

633
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:21,278
what I'm going to talk about this this

634
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:23,398
is the system we have now moved to um

635
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:27,000
part of the reason it is when we know

636
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:29,798
till under we have now went to raising

637
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,880
food gra be we cannot have ride in our

638
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:35,599
we and there is no way to follow no ta

639
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,039
beeds that have ride in it and go in and

640
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:40,359
plant food grade weed and not have some

641
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:42,960
we volunteer weed in there so we have to

642
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:45,558
get away from that and I may I'm hoping

643
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,278
that we can figure out our our crop

644
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:49,918
rotation maybe that we can bring it back

645
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:52,159
because it does work the other problem

646
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,519
we have is we have inconsistent soils

647
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,278
you can have five so TS in 20 AC Fi not

648
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,038
more and when you over winter we'll have

649
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,798
dial

650
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:04,599
so then we have issues with spots that

651
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:07,200
don't have any so now what we have

652
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:09,719
started doing is we plant Rye at the

653
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,360
same time in the spring that we plant

654
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,278
soy this gets us in actually a month

655
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,158
earlier to plant our beats so instead of

656
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,359
waiting till the r is in the proper

657
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,919
stage of R which it's you know like late

658
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:23,639
may now we are playing usually the last

659
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:25,720
week April the first week and we will

660
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,600
literally go in with our drill on 7 half

661
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,880
spacing the big drill you saw pl we two

662
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:35,558
Ry and we are in the same Field playing

663
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:38,640
with the be um and then this is what the

664
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:40,398
r in this picture you'll see you don't

665
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,840
see the RADS over to this side this is

666
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:47,479
my actually a trial we were doing on 50s

667
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:50,000
too to see which we like better y was no

668
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:55,319
different but the third answer is spot

669
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,038
dve I need to or if I need to come back

670
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:00,038
andate or I like this Roo IDE

671
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,798
but so this is the Tage when we plant

672
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,240
you see there's a be just cracking

673
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:10,798
through you can see the r on side the

674
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,440
other great thing about this is the ride

675
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:16,278
comes up few days before the so we are

676
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,600
reducing the amount of days that we have

677
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:20,558
open soil there to run all we had get

678
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,158
something growing

679
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,319
quicker well this is a little bit later

680
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,399
not sure probably a week or so later

681
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:29,960
beans are coming up now we have time

682
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:32,038
weed these when they were small back

683
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,029
before the other picture could needed

684
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:35,599
and amazingly the r

685
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:38,519
[Music]

686
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:41,439
still so there's the picture we saw and

687
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:44,240
this is um at this point I had a one of

688
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,440
my landowners who never had an organic

689
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,038
Farmer on his farming board first was

690
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,759
the second year I had organic crops on

691
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:52,519
his farm and I told him I was plant

692
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:54,158
beans he calls me and uh we went away

693
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,720
for the weekend or something I get this

694
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:00,840
very nasty phone call and just so you

695
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:04,480
know his son work works for be Santa and

696
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:06,798
so they are like yeah I I can't do

697
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,880
anything right so he's like what kind of

698
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,119
mess do you have out there you know I

699
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,720
thought you PL soy beans and blah blah

700
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:18,479
blah that and this

701
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:21,038
is and like no way you know what M so I

702
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,679
told and he said

703
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:27,359
yeah and so we went on and this is what

704
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,600
they looked like a few weeks later so

705
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:32,599
now the Rock basically just kind of

706
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,079
starts to roll this and it'll literally

707
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,639
by the time we Harvest you won't be able

708
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,960
to see it'll just kind of disappear and

709
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,399
go away so then oh there's our we

710
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,919
picture sometimes this is not the same

711
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,158
field sometimes we we do we do some

712
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,679
zapping every Year's different some

713
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,440
years I'll use a weed zapper on a whole

714
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,000
bunch Acres multiple times other years I

715
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,440
might give a weed zapper out except the

716
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,519
it just depends on the year we

717
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,360
do but this is that field the first

718
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,480
field that had Ry in it and this field

719
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,798
actually made over

720
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,880
74 and the neighbor or the land he

721
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:12,720
actually was sitting in his truck I

722
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:16,679
was and I I made him call

723
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,679
R and so he he was impressed now his son

724
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:24,480
who has a test lot

725
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,480
with be right across the road

726
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:31,199
had my inspector thought was interesting

727
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,840
put a picture it

728
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,240
for and we didn't Le that this field at

729
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:39,558
all so it it did well there's a few I'm

730
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,558
not

731
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,840
say what I want to show though is I talk

732
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,679
about economics and I'm going to show

733
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:51,119
you this on corn too and so this is

734
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:53,080
comparing for all the organic all us

735
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,518
organic farmers here we see lower prices

736
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:57,398
and they're like oh man this sucks and

737
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,399
it does don't get me wrong yeah we don't

738
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:03,000
like to see low Oran prices but we need

739
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:07,599
to look compare to what

740
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:11,398
convention so if you look gu okay so

741
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:13,439
even and Y wise we're very similar our

742
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:17,798
our farm yields have actually went

743
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,278
up on corn especially very similar on on

744
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:22,918
we no longer raise any conventional

745
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:25,599
props but I had to out budget to re out

746
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,440
these are the high ones but for instance

747
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,918
let's just look at our cost here right

748
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,440
here organic with that coning crop which

749
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:37,960
would be similar to no just under $600

750
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:41,120
the no with the chemicals they're using

751
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:45,038
they're over 600 their costs are

752
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:49,359
higher and so you see price prop so then

753
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:52,759
we have the bonus of you know OB price

754
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:56,158
higher everybody's cost but that figures

755
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:59,200
are red in that figures are time labor

756
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,480
and so many other but try we have to

757
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,200
remember things aren't as bad sometimes

758
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:08,839
on pric I'll show

759
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,919
you so legumes we're big into legumes

760
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:12,678
before you know before corn and small

761
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:17,600
grains because we need we need to grow

762
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:19,399
as much can um peas we are now using

763
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,278
austri winter peas which I'll talk a

764
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:23,439
little bit more about how we use those

765
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:26,119
to plant them in the fall we actually no

766
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,960
till those into being stubble 3 and half

767
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:32,000
in deep usually after Thanksgiving they

768
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,360
may or ideally they don't come up but

769
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,079
they end up usually coming up the way

770
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,558
our Winter s in and then we let them

771
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:39,638
grow till about mid late May and we plow

772
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,599
them down and

773
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:44,719
plant but we like might theer one red

774
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:47,519
clover or just

775
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,558
a uh this is just shows what we're going

776
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,359
you know those worms those are my those

777
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:53,359
are my

778
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:54,959
works there that's what counts you know

779
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:57,398
that's what's making my nutrients

780
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,519
available what we have you can see

781
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:02,278
here's PE plant there's a little bit of

782
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,278
out there

783
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:09,878
see see you got fixing stuff going here

784
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,639
it's just really good it's really a ni

785
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:15,598
situation so here's the Austrian winter

786
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,200
P that the picture on the left those

787
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,679
that would have been taken these are all

788
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,759
whole year ago um but this would have

789
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,960
been taken in December a whole year ago

790
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,079
and so you can see what they look like

791
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,240
they don't look like much when we're

792
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,639
just pling for cover probably

793
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:33,199
and ideally I don't want them any taller

794
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,559
than what this last picture is but last

795
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:40,878
year's win was a warmer so they did get

796
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:42,239
tall so then we let them grow I said

797
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,960
this was actually I went back and looked

798
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,000
this may 26th the middle picture the the

799
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,440
left and the left picture the right

800
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,760
picture was earlier in you can see what

801
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,760
they look like but we're actually they

802
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,639
had gotten 6 ft tall and we are running

803
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,040
this up old this over because we

804
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,280
couldn't get them to plow because they

805
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:01,159
were so stringy there're six T now

806
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,640
they're laying all ground so we ran ran

807
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,960
a big disc over knock

808
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:10,358
down and you can

809
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,358
see see what they look like they

810
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,280
provid so this is that cornfield corn on

811
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:21,680
May 26 this is his cornfield later in

812
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,880
summer the cornfield averaged 250 AC and

813
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:26,239
that's average that's what the edges so

814
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,720
I I one one thing we've been working on

815
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:31,078
doing it's the average matters yeah I

816
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,959
had we can talk about crazy numers and

817
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,599
stuff like that but it's the average

818
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,519
that matters because that's what pays do

819
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:43,480
so our farm average is not

820
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:43,480
nor very last years

821
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,280
very as you'll see on my budgets I use

822
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,400
150 back here you'll see I'm saying

823
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,000
showing

824
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,519
301 but our costs are still our costs

825
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,838
are

826
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,838
compared

827
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:07,280
to so we're still very

828
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,680
simar yeah maybe we're get $8 a bush and

829
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,960
it's not1 a bush but we're still we're

830
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:16,118
still profit and that's you know like

831
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,559
said mind mind if we can be

832
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:22,160
profitable these conven guys you know

833
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,199
which used to be me right now when talk

834
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:25,960
to their Banker or something or

835
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:29,199
whatever that's going to be fun

836
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,760
discussion I know my tough

837
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:35,439
exception small grains um said we raised

838
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,720
some different wheat oats seral

839
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,440
rley I think the top one is spring weat

840
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:44,358
that was my first year that's the

841
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:48,960
picture I S is so we raise we do we

842
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:52,799
raise hard we yeah so

843
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,079
picture so we raise hard wheat or Farm

844
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,920
ground flow up here in New York and we

845
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:01,519
use spray wheat and

846
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,599
and at my Chad's meeting and I tell

847
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,239
people you know when it comes to

848
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,960
marketing we come to these meetings and

849
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:10,959
some people

850
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,159
like it was total chance perue had their

851
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,199
first ever organic meeting just like you

852
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:18,078
guys day I didn't know tour anywhere I

853
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:19,639
was speaking on Hay production he was

854
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,079
speaking on grain production we got to

855
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:25,440
know each other we become friends and

856
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:28,200
you know it just kind of he needed

857
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,440
another person Grace we and out of the

858
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:33,598
area and

859
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,280
it's so and and we found that we have a

860
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,318
little different plan so it's nice to

861
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:43,079
have that that kind of works together

862
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:47,358
spreading but I few years ago and I up

863
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:50,039
here course for the first so enjoy that

864
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:52,159
enjoy the friendships making this and

865
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:54,920
being able to call somebody questions we

866
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:58,000
always tell you need a mentor when

867
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,720
you're in a and getting even if you're

868
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,920
longterm it's all about communication

869
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,759
talking and finding out what works for

870
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,318
one person what doesn't because we all

871
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,720
have so much information it's one of the

872
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:12,159
cool things about over conventional well

873
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,919
not a conventional F it's like all

874
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,799
nobody wants to talk you know one farmer

875
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,000
doesn't share because you might take it

876
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:22,519
maybe you'll take his farm or something

877
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,318
I we don't we're all very open group and

878
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:27,759
we

879
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:30,079
appreciate so we do raise oats um that's

880
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,480
a weird one that started right when we

881
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,560
started raising hay in the early 2000s

882
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,240
we found an oak variety that would could

883
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:40,639
raise raise basically 38 to 40 pound

884
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:43,759
testway oats in Ohio which is I heard of

885
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:46,318
basing Canadian test oats in Ohio and on

886
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,720
top of that our protein is 2 point is 2%

887
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:51,480
higher than Canadian so before we were

888
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:55,959
in we were selling this to a little

889
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:59,240
feemale for their Fe RS and now then we

890
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:02,318
built following monst all the AIP there

891
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:07,959
and so we deliver usually between 15 and

892
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:07,960
20,000 bushels 225 250 Bush at a

893
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,960
time and they don't care if it's organic

894
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,318
but they love the service and and we do

895
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,960
all right on the price and it's usually

896
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:20,279
within about 20 miles but I have six of

897
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,440
those gravity we're just

898
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,040
driving it works out good you take it

899
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,880
there you let them because it never

900
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:31,679
fails and and this and I had this with

901
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,358
uh even some English boers too that they

902
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:37,399
want you to shov and so I take the wagon

903
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:39,679
put the barn for whatever they want I'm

904
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,800
not staying help just

905
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,000
call there's nothing worse than

906
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,400
shoveling that into a Greenery that's

907
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,239
six feet up in

908
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,480
there so barley somebody we were talking

909
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,199
earlier a couple of us about we raised

910
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,119
quite a bit barley we raised bar in our

911
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:58,078
Farms since 1970s my father was a h

912
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,680
operation he loved it and speed r with

913
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,039
for H you would replace the corn one of

914
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:06,639
the cool things we kept raising and our

915
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:09,679
local um Water Conservancy District it's

916
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:12,318
called M Watershed consy District they

917
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:14,598
actually have taken their fees that they

918
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:17,119
they charge Landing for so instead of

919
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,280
going and you know dredging out the

920
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,519
water and stuff they're paying they've

921
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,640
been for almost 20 years now paying

922
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:26,880
Farmers to put covers on so they had

923
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,838
this program and we got into supplying

924
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,960
the seed

925
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:31,358
because we can supply the seed cheaper

926
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,599
than they can go and get it from St

927
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:37,039
Canada so we Supply them they Supply

928
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,318
even bu 6,000 Acres a year with three

929
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,639
planes and we provide them with a barley

930
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:44,920
oats mix that they put on used to be a

931
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:46,719
riat mix personally I preer the ride mix

932
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,760
but all these conventional farmers are

933
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:51,480
scared to ride in the wet spring when

934
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,200
Ride This Tall it makes them get nervous

935
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,119
and so they like barley barley works but

936
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:58,919
it's a great outlet for us so we sell we

937
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:02,720
sell probably ,000 of Oak just for

938
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,039
farming just for cover and that's worked

939
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:07,239
well it's also we're going to talk about

940
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,800
sunflowers just a second almost all of

941
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:10,399
our sunflowers are double propped behind

942
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,960
Mar I heard Peter asked about that

943
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,358
earlier um so we've had really good luck

944
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,358
with that we also rais some single CR

945
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:21,519
ones but it seems like for us in Ohio

946
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,318
later we plan up to a point we can plan

947
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:26,480
up to about the 4th of July later we

948
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:29,119
plan the better the meal and the better

949
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,639
the disease you know disease reverses

950
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,640
resistance and all the other things so

951
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:36,639
we don't actually they prefer drive but

952
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:37,879
they sunflowers Thrive we we had really

953
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:39,879
dry weather this year and we had the

954
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,039
best

955
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,200
sunflower so here's some sunflower

956
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:46,480
pictur our sunflowers um you know this

957
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:48,519
is what they look like they're right um

958
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,400
I would what Heather said earlier she

959
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:53,358
said 30,000 we plant 25,000 but we don't

960
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,480
want to plant too little because you get

961
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:56,838
these huge heads and I've not had a

962
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,280
drawing problem because we take all our

963
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:01,519
sunflow off 15% moisture and then air

964
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,560
dry them in a Bend with just air and we

965
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:06,759
get them down to 10% but the problem is

966
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,639
when they're big heads every time one

967
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,400
does fall on the head you have a big

968
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,559
mess because you lost a lot more of them

969
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,079
plus they're a lot harder to harvest the

970
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:17,078
heads and rush so a nice consistent

971
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,519
head so it shows what our average HS in

972
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,640
Ohio have been around 1800 2,000 lbs the

973
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:28,719
acre this year we actually PB the acre

974
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:31,358
that's the best we had in

975
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:34,318
average so but I've also had a year

976
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:37,880
where I've averaged 1300 times wet years

977
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:39,279
are like I said earlier wet is terrible

978
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,960
especially if it's wet the first three

979
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,079
weeks when you PL it's if the forecast

980
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,679
is for wet weather and your plant hours

981
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,519
leave them in the bank you're better off

982
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,960
to wait for drive out because you will

983
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,599
end up having to replant them or have a

984
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,400
weak M or they'll have disease problems

985
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,400
that just do not want to

986
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,000
plan so

987
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,800
Purdue Agra business who some of you

988
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,039
know they do contract I have nothing in

989
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,559
it and some of you may know my DS on we

990
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:11,039
go there but I still do contract with

991
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:14,119
them they done it's a great place for a

992
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:15,920
market or something and they you know it

993
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:19,599
it's they have that market and it's been

994
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,880
good I just wish their price is as

995
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,318
and so on the ha sales I'll just hit on

996
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,880
this a little bit I can speak for an

997
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:29,880
hour on that but we just quick so our

998
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,920
goal goal has always been to provide

999
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,440
consistent high quality Dair ha locally

1000
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,920
and then deliver it small qualities

1001
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,639
rather than a lot of the ha used to come

1002
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,960
in from out west in our area and semi a

1003
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,519
lot of customers don't want to have to

1004
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,838
pay for an entire semi at one time so we

1005
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:48,000
will deliver basic

1006
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:51,159
pass and d and dump them everything's

1007
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
wrapped nothing dry and I said about

1008
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:57,719
quality everything's tested and our best

1009
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,559
quality we we consistently can raise

1010
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:03,318
200

1011
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:04,839
R5 27% protein a but we don't want

1012
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:07,039
because not every customer wants that

1013
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:08,880
every C every customer is different we

1014
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,759
rais everything from lower qu first

1015
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,640
cutting up the grand

1016
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,480
premium so and everything sold privately

1017
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:17,598
we don't do through auctions I built a

1018
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,960
basically built a a mailing list over

1019
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,240
the past 20 some years of customers that

1020
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,880
have bought for me and with over a

1021
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:26,799
thousand names on it I send that list

1022
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,800
out and that's pretty much how we sell

1023
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,480
all for hey and then and they basically

1024
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,720
call us while we've been here today ibly

1025
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:36,920
had

1026
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,679
five um it it's been a good thing like I

1027
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,720
said it it is what allowed us to get

1028
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:43,719
into organic but it's also what pushed

1029
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:46,078
to get into organic back in 2 I think 14

1030
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:48,399
or 15 whole bunch of my conventional

1031
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,079
dairies small conventional dairies

1032
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,680
within about a three week time span in

1033
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,000
November of that year I remember I had

1034
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:55,199
all these phone calls canceling their

1035
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,599
headers they were organic they were

1036
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,358
getting picked up by organic valley and

1037
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,359
and I was bumed and the next question I

1038
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:04,799
op but I don't wor get p and so that

1039
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:07,558
kind of I been thinking about switching

1040
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,839
to organic and that gave you the push to

1041
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:14,440
keep going and kind of

1042
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:16,920
driven this is just so when we make ay

1043
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,519
we talk about efficiency I think I might

1044
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,800
have a video later but this is we have

1045
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:23,920
run three rappers there's two big square

1046
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:27,480
B running I have a pickup crew um

1047
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,039
usually there's there's probably n or at

1048
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,599
working but in on a on a the best day

1049
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:33,800
we've ever had was 1,800 big square

1050
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,640
bales bailed and wrapped and we were

1051
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,800
done in the house by 10: that night um

1052
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,598
so we can we can pretty much bail 100

1053
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,079
Baals an hour per bailer so that's 200

1054
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:45,119
Baals an hour we can pick up that many

1055
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:48,240
and wrapping is maybe not quite that

1056
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:51,119
much but uh yeah it's a it's a fast

1057
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:53,558
process because I don't want those bails

1058
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,559
once they're bailed sit very long before

1059
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:59,480
they get toass they want F possible

1060
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:01,119
so we're getting uh we're getting five

1061
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,318

question I well say I want to say one

1121
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,119
thing because these two I I've been a

1122
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:30,279
lot of different conferences and I I

1123
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:32,720
helped Ohio State start theirs three

1124
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,839
years ago you guys don't realize how

1125

1135
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,240
you go pretty late and still get decent

1136
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:03,440
meals but so we plant July 4th is our

1137
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:06,479
date that we go by by planed up to the

1138
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,240
10th of July and uh with the later Falls

1139
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,519
we've had we've not had any problems I

1140
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,598
probably go evener than that I'm going

1141
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:15,759
to try on this year after week see if I

1142
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:17,240
can do it but yeah so I would say in

1143
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,079
that respect now now you do plant the

1144
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:21,959
shorter season you don't want to plant

1145
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:27,760
you plant the long season

1146
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,760
don't any other questions questions SC

1147
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,679

1148
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:52,400
isolated and you don't want you know

1149
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:54,078
it's you're isolated and yet you guys

1150
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,639
have this great Community here so it's

1151
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,240

good it's neat we have a similar

1153
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:02,078
situation honestly it's not you guys

1154
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:03,798
have a way better group of people up

1155
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,880
here we have a great organic group down

1156
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:08,559
oura

1157
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:14,240
nothing

1158
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:14,240
I probably wasn't but would be

1159
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:21,599
greats it is tap it is tap okay

1160
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:25,200
yeah yeah we got you long season F you

1161
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:27,200
plan and what is your average

1162
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:30,798
cross so

1163
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:34,558
we plant in our I'll answer the long

1164
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:36,679
seon corn part two two works we normally

1165
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,240
in our area most people plant 110 day

1166
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:43,598
corn we plant the longest we plant is

1167
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:45,439
104 or 105 and we go down to 9 I like

1168
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,119
the plan we try to take our corn off

1169
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,400
earlier when we're no tilling when we're

1170
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,160
planing wheat or I mean planing ride no

1171
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,318
we will take our corn off at 28%

1172
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:58,000
moisture and dry it down we like to be

1173
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:59,920
started early in October our frost a is

1174
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,199
usually what's your what's your biggest

1175
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:08,079
crop AC uh

1176
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:08,078
usually those are probably my I would

1177
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:21,358
say any the C mag aftering so

1178
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:25,078
soon so good question so that's why we

1179
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:27,598
plow and uh so we try to bury it enough

1180
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,440
um what we found is that we run the Lin

1181
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,720
in a high speeed disc and we only bu

1182
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,720
like two Ines heat we have to wait

1183
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:36,959
usually two weeks and what we we gotten

1184
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:39,199
CAU there because it happens to be dry

1185
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,318
and the soil dry we actually waited two

1186
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:45,239
weeks planted and then it rain and then

1187
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:46,639
we so that's why we plow we try to like

1188
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:48,358
six inches deep and then we come back

1189
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:50,279
the next day before things dry out and

1190
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:55,880
fly that's how we

1191
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:58,040
get yeah when PL uh the rise into what

1192
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,640
was it uh

1193
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:06,199
soy so it won

1194
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:06,199
veral what's your space drill the drill

1195
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:16,679
7 um two questions on uh your your flame

1196
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:19,519
weeding um do you flame all your corn

1197
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:22,318
Acres yeah uh we try to you try yeah we

1198
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,159
try to that's all and do you only do the

1199
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:25,599
in row flaming because you talked about

1200
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:29,519
the in row flaming but then I saw a

1201
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,359
picture of row flaming so we only flame

1202
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,960
over the roow we don't flame in between

1203
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:36,239
the roads because and we never it can be

1204
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,079
set up to what they call broadcast flame

1205
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:40,479
and I know some people that do that and

1206
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,599
they say it works really good but it's

1207
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,599
just you use it at least twice as much

1208
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:49,400
propane and slower so I'm like this just

1209
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,400
be over we can drive

1210
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:57,280
about we telling the story

1211
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:59,440
earlier soybean theal were growing at

1212
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,200
the same time and then at some point the

1213
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,400
cereal rival was like press I think I

1214
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:06,399
missed it how how did that happen it so

1215
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,838
the because it's a winter drop and it

1216
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,519
doesn't vernalize it will get about and

1217
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:13,358
it depends on how much have if it's dry

1218
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:15,559
it won't get as tall but it'll only get

1219
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,798
about that tall and then it'll just kind

1220
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:20,160
of it just kind of goes away because it

1221
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:23,798
can't it's not

1222
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:26,639
going and so just kind of eyes B I have

1223
00:53:23,798 --> 00:53:29,679
only ever had it fail one time course

1224
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:31,798
year because we dry our F or our home

1225
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:34,078
place we were dry but not super dry and

1226
00:53:31,798 --> 00:53:36,599
we planted early where we planted early

1227
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,920
like I said be great where we came back

1228
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:43,599
we had some later ones that were two

1229
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,599
weeks later are be because we it was

1230
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:52,719
just this has been a production of
