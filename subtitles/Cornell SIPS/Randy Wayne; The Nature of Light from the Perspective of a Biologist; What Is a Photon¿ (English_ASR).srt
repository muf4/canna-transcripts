1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:12,279
University lights the ultimate source of

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:15,519
energy on Earth through photosynthesis

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:18,198
it provides us with clothing food

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,559
housing for people that work with plants

6
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:25,840
it's absolutely essential for

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:28,320
germination phototropism flowering

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,640
pollination I see it as a first

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,558
principle in the plant World in fact

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,960
this is my high school textbook for

11
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,280
biology and it's life is the light is

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:45,439
the energy for life and it goes on to a

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,439
chapter telling us what is light at the

14
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,519
time actually I did stage lighting in

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:56,119
high school and my goal was to for those

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,600
that are older to do light rock bands

17
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:03,198
with chipmunk but it didn't happen

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,159
although I did work on light and how it

19
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:10,079
activates cells for Peter Hepler and at

20
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,640
the um time we looked at everything to

21
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,560
understand it based on chemistry physics

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,319
biology history and philosophy and

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:23,320
you'll see that approach here

24
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:27,078
today so as Socrates said follow

25
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:30,199
everything to the end wherever it leads

26
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:32,199
you and I ended up becoming a plant cell

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,680
biologist and light

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,439
microscopist wrote two books both in the

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,280
Third Edition and uh throughout these

30
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:43,879
books there they I try to help people

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,960
understand and actually that's really

32
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:51,519
important to understand um light and

33
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:53,839
cell biology based on chemistry physics

34
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,199
um history and

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,439
philosophy so let's start from the very

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,439
beginning oh just came out last week

37
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:05,478
and God said let there be light and

38
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:07,359
there was light and God saw that the

39
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:09,118
light was good but let's get in a little

40
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,598
more

41
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:16,000
detail okay so Christian hyans figured

42
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:18,359
light was a wave it couldn't be a corpal

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,878
because if it was a corpal then if this

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,239
person was looking at the bird and this

45
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,518
person was looking at the flower the

46
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:30,360
corpal would hit each other and just go

47
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:33,080
everywhere so light must be a wave

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,000
well Newton said no no no light can't be

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,800
a wave because if you take a human here

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,919
and you shine light on it waves tend to

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
go behind something next time you're

52
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,639
walking by water and you see a stick

53
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,399
coming up you'll see the waves go around

54
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,359
but Newton couldn't see that so he said

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,879
light must be a

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:57,000
corpal okay this is what corpal look

57
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,000
like this is what waves look

58
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,878
like if it can't be a wave and it can't

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,598
be a

60
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:08,280
corpal maybe it can be a

61
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:11,359
particle and a wave or corpal and a wave

62
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,719
or particle or two and that's what I'll

63
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,840
come back

64
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,919
to Thomas Young actually repeated

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,239
Newton's experiment and found out that

66
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,280
the light that hit both sides of the

67
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,519
barrier actually went

68
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,719
around that Newton missed this and

69
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,400
actually my students do this every year

70
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:33,280
although it's really easy with the ler

71
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,319
and very difficult with sunlight in

72
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,560
England because you don't get much

73
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:40,399
brightness and coherence but anyhow this

74
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,840
happened so this was evidence that light

75
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,680
behaved as a

76
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,280
wave there's light hitting two different

77
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,040
holes they come out and they make a

78
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,199
pattern like this and Thomas Young said

79
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:57,199
it made this pattern because when the

80
00:03:54,199 --> 00:04:00,318
crests came together you'd get

81
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,560
constructive interference if the PR were

82
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,719
out of phase you'd get destructive

83
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,079
interference and that would account for

84
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:11,199
the light and dark

85
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,680
bands you know Thomas Young might have

86
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,798
been kind of bright because he started

87
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,358
off doing

88
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,358
botney here's his first paper on a

89
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:29,478
perculia okay so light seemed to be a

90
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:31,879
wave and James clerk maw Maxwell showed

91
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:34,399
that it was electromagnetic wave so

92
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:37,319
here's how he showed it he took

93
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:41,319
Faraday's experiment that when you move

94
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:44,599
a magnet through a coil you create an

95
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,560
electric current in that coil so see my

96
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,360
thumb that's the

97
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,720
magnet and my fingers are the um current

98
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,120
in the

99
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,880
coil that's what this symbol

100
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,478
means that you move a magnet up and down

101
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:04,639
and around it you get a Circle or the

102
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:09,639
curl of the

103
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:12,800
current ampere showed that if you have a

104
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,400
current moving across an electric field

105
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,319
it will generate a magnetic field around

106
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:20,038
it this equation set my hand is now the

107
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,840
same as the equation you have a current

108
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:25,759
going this way make a magnetic field

109
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:28,159
that goes around it anybody clear on

110
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,680
that okay we'll get past the vector

111
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,759
calculus now Maxwell also assume that

112
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,280
the Divergence of E equals zero that

113
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,960
means that there's no sources of of

114
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:43,758
electric fields or no syns for electric

115
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,758
fields in other words there's no

116
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,038
electric

117
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,879
field oh wait a

118
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:54,639
minute isn't light the Carri

119
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,719
electromagnetic force we'll put that

120
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,879
aside and this

121
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,759
here means that there's no magnetic

122
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,680
monopoles that means you can't have just

123
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,960
a North magnet without a South Magnet or

124
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,000
South without a north and that part's

125
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,478
actually

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,240
true okay the Maxwell math was a little

127
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,038
too simple here because this says as

128
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,439
soon as you change the magnetic field

129
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:23,719
you get a change in the electric

130
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,839
field in other words there's no cause

131
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,440
and effect

132
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,719
relationships it happens

133
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,759
simultaneously same thing here have a

134
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,440
change in electric field instantaneously

135
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,759
get a change in magnetic field and that

136
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,560
shows up in his wave equation notice

137
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,680
that the electric and the magnetic

138
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,240
fields are in

139
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,639
Phase okay so as long as we assume

140
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,199
causality doesn't count Maxwell's wave

141
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,918
equation is

142
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,639
good oh let's also assume that

143
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:56,719
conservation of energy doesn't count

144
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:00,918
because here you have zero energy

145
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,280
maximum zero maximum

146
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:05,758
zero okay there's a few flaws in

147
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:09,559
Maxwell's

148
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,919
equation we're going to question these

149
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,360
assumptions Einstein actually questioned

150
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,639
the assumptions he said we should

151
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,199
remember that the elementary Quantum of

152
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,720
electricity um Epsilon I call Q is an

153
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,960
outsider in Maxwell Loren's

154
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,639
electrodynamics the fundamental equation

155
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,918
of Optics will have to be replaced by an

156
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,759
equation in which the universal constant

157
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:35,318
Epsilon probably at Square also appears

158
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,038
in a coefficient I have not yet

159
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,080
succeeded in finding a system of

160
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,918
equations suitable for the construction

161
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:44,240
of the elementary electrical Quantum and

162
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:47,198
the like Quant the variety of

163
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,038
possibilities does not seem so great for

164
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,199
one to have to shrink from this task and

165
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:54,279
I

166
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,199
didn't and I'll tell you how I found the

167
00:07:54,279 --> 00:08:00,198
way okay but let's start from the very

168
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,199
beginning

169
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,080
okay in the

170
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:07,080
beginning there was energy and one of

171
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:10,359
the forms of energy four fundamental

172
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:14,519
forces one was electromagnetic force and

173
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,400
it split and gave rise to matter and

174
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:20,158
an here's a symbol of a photon giving

175
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:22,359
rise to a particle and an antiparticle

176
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:26,360
it's called pair

177
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,479
production okay there is antimatter in

178
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,320
itha bananas which are full of potassium

179
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:35,759
mostly potassium 39 have a sizable

180
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,800
amount of potassium 40 which is

181
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:43,918
radioactive and it decays into argon 40

182
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:47,199
by emitting a positron so positron is a

183
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:51,199
particle of antimatter and there's about

184
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
one produced every 70

185
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:58,039
minutes also a cuga medical center

186
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,239
there's pet scans positron emission

187
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,480
tomography where you take take fluod

188
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,680
deoxy glucose this is really interesting

189
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,440
Otto varberg found out that cancer cells

190
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,639
ferment they don't respire they ferment

191
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,480
you would think it's the opposite but

192
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:16,278
because they ferment they need tons of

193
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,240
glucose so you give the body fluod deoxy

194
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:23,200
glucose and it goes right to those

195
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,480
cancer cells the Florine gives off a

196
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,839
positron the

197
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,000
positron beats with an

198
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,320
electron from the

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,799
cancer it gives

200
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,519
off gamma rays and you have detectors

201
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:41,559
that now can localize the

202
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:44,120
cancer using positron emission

203
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:47,479
tomography and last week we

204
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:51,120
heard that Margaret uses positron

205
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,800
emission tomography to look at

206
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,440
grafting okay so there's two

207
00:09:53,799 --> 00:10:01,039
complimentary processes peer production

208
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,200
converting light energy into matter and

209
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:08,078
antimatter and Annihilation converting

210
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,240
matter and antimatter into light energy

211
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:13,319
all based on equals

212
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,799
mc2 now some of you must be

213
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,240
thinking if light can turn into

214
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,519
antimatter and

215
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,039
matter and matter and antimatter can

216
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,919
turn into

217
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:28,120
light could it just be that light is

218
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,120
made out of matter and antimatter

219
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,120
okay let's look at what the big boys say

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,639
about matter and

221
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,600
anti there's something called charge

222
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:43,600
parity time symmetry that if you want to

223
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,040
convert a particle of matter to a

224
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,720
particle of antimatter what you do is

225
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:51,639
you change the

226
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,680
charge you change the spin the direction

227
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,879
of Spin and you change the direction it

228
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:00,159
moves in

229
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:02,200
time okay so if this is positive

230
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,519
positive

231
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,278
positive this is negative negative

232
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:10,200
negative product of this is positive

233
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:13,958
product of this is negative matter

234
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,959
equals the minus of

235
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:23,159
antimatter who here has seen time go

236
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,638
backwards I want to start with the

237
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:29,958
assumptions of a scientist that what you

238
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:33,039
see is pretty close to what's real let

239
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:36,159
necessarily but it's a great first

240
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:42,000
approximation okay so I've never

241
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:42,000
seen my any manner going backwards in

242
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,959
time I've never seen mitosis or myosis

243
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,638
all those other cells that are made come

244
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:53,319
together and make one cell although 30

245
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,240
40 years ago I published a paper in the

246
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,680
Journal of very producible results that

247
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,680
said I

248
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:04,599
did okay okay and are Elementary

249
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,519
particles mathematical points or do they

250
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,519
have

251
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,000
extension I me what is actually the

252
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,278
definition of

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,240
matter definition of matter is something

254
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:17,519
that has mass and

255
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,519
extension for example compared to

256
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,720
ideas Robert Hook wrote micrographia in

257
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,439
1665 here's his microscope and he said

258
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,079
I'm going to start this whole field the

259
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,000
microscopy like a geometer would I'm

260
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:37,719
going to start with a point so he looked

261
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,240
at the point of a

262
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,519
needle and he saw how blunt it was it

263
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,519
had

264
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,240
extension he looked at a line next like

265
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,480
a razor blade and saw how unline likee

266
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,959
it

267
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,959
was okay so this brings us now to about

268
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:01,399
8 to 1900 and Lord Kelvin who actually

269
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:04,759
came to Cornell and said it's the

270
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,759
prettiest campus in the

271
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:14,800
world gave a talk which was

272
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,839
entitled 19th century clouds over the

273
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:21,078
dynamical theory of heat and

274
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,600
light and in it he said the beauty and

275
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:25,919
clearness of the dynamical theory which

276
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,480
asserts heat and light to be modes of

277
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:32,039
motion which is

278
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:34,320
waves is at present obscured by two

279
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:38,039
clouds how could the earth move through

280
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,680
an elastic solid such as essentially is

281
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:45,799
Luminous iferous

282
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:51,000
ether okay so water waves move through

283
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:53,240
water seismic waves move through Rock

284
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,759
sound waves move through

285
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:59,278
air what do light waves move through

286
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:02,360
they move through the Luminous ether

287
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:05,838
luminiferous ether but if you figure out

288
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,199
the speed of light and the transvers of

289
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,120
the waves that ether would have to be so

290
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,719
viscous that would have stopped the

291
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,360
Earth from

292
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,240
moving so it was a real conundrum and

293
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,039
remember how I told you that Maxwell

294
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,839
didn't put any of the electrical

295
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:26,480
properties into his light

296
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:29,160
wave he put them all into The Ether so

297
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,519
the little balls of the electric current

298
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:35,519
and the big ones are magnetic forces

299
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:38,360
moving around in circles so here we had

300
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,919
this ether that was thick enough to stop

301
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,399
the Earth from moving that would carry

302
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:45,120
the light

303
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,320
waves and then after Michaelson and

304
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,919
Morley did their experiment that said

305
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,278
doesn't matter which direction you move

306
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:53,958
in The Ether the speed of light's the

307
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,639
same Einstein said then there must be no

308
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:59,559
ether just must be people's imagination

309
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,959
and he banned The Ether it was God so

310
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:04,879
have now we have no ether and now

311
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:06,719
there's some room for some the quantum

312
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,078
mechanical

313
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:14,680
Photon there was one

314
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:17,838
other Cloud over 19th century physics

315
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:21,319
and that was um Maxwell bolt boltzman

316
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,000
doctrine that said that pressure is

317
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,720
caused by molecules which are

318
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,039
mathematical points moving and hitting

319
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,920
the edges of things and the more you

320
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:34,360
heat them up the faster they move and

321
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:38,439
the more pressure they exert and the um

322
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,959
and certain um and and they would hold a

323
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,160
certain amount of heat based on these

324
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:46,078
motions so you heat the molecules up and

325
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,639
they move faster so they're using that

326
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,799
heat up and they're holding that heat

327
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,959
but there were some molecules that held

328
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:56,599
even more heat than like helium which is

329
00:15:53,958 --> 00:16:00,198
a mon monoatomic

330
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,720
gas things like datomic gas es like

331
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:08,078
hydrogen so it turned out that hydrogen

332
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:11,319
held instead of three half KT of heat 5

333
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:14,519
half KD because they had rotational

334
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:16,919
motion so they can save that heat in

335
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,600
rotating more and actually there's

336
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:22,399
vibrational moment Mo motion too in

337
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:28,240
other molecules for example bromides

338
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:30,879
2 um that has 7 KT of heat so the more

339
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,919
What's called the re of Freedom you have

340
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:37,559
the more types of motion you have

341
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:40,599
translational motion rotational motion

342
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,518
vibrational motion you can hold more

343
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,399
heat so everything just didn't work like

344
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:51,440
a mathematical point

345
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:55,039
and Lord Calvin wanted to point that

346
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,000
out now will I sorry I spelled that back

347
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,719
I spelled that wrong that's the right

348
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,839
way the um will H we wanted to apply

349
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,759
Maxwell boltzman movement of particles

350
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,558
to understand black body radiation he

351
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,480
figured the molecules inside the black

352
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:14,000
body were

353
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,360
moving and as they were moving as you

354
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,838
heated them up theyd move faster and

355
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,519
they'd give off higher energy light and

356
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,399
it seemed to work pretty well for

357
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,879
example this red this black line is the

358
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,160
actual data and the red line is his

359
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,880
theory and of course all of us as

360
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,600
biologists we jump at this and we'd go

361
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,080
out for a beer and celebrate I mean this

362
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,079
is really great but physicists really do

363
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:42,359
know how to measure

364
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:45,279
things and it wasn't good

365
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:48,359
enough so plon looked at this and said

366
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,359
how can I improve

367
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:55,600
this liit one of the inventors of

368
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:58,918
calculus had the law of continuity

369
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:01,558
nature doesn't do anything in jumps

370
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:04,159
everything is continuous if you read

371
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:06,558
Origin of Species Daren will say nature

372
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,280
does nothing and jumps although he says

373
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:12,678
it in Latin I will screw it up so you

374
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:16,359
can look it up so what planks assumed

375
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:19,400
that just maybe if these oscillators

376
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:23,359
these atoms in the wall somehow

377
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,840
discreetly sent out light now this was

378
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,359
like a combination of the atom and the

379
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:31,359
light so it wasn't like a photon yet but

380
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:35,038
there was a discreet thing then he could

381
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:38,399
model the black body radiation

382
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:41,480
perfect and the discreetness related to

383
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,759
the energy of that oscillator light

384
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,839
combination which was equal to what

385
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,240
boltzman called Plank's constant times

386
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:52,558
the frequency of the oscillation or

387
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,359
light or Plank's constant times the

388
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:58,879
speed of light divided by the wavelength

389
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,839
C speed of light equals wavelength time

390
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,840
velocity I

391
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:10,158
frequency okay but Einstein out planked

392
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,759
plank he said I'm going to make light

393
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:15,080
just a mathematical Point as discreet as

394
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:18,200
you can

395
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:20,119
get it seems to me that the observations

396
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,319
regarding black body radiation

397
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:24,798
photoluminescence production of cathod r

398
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,240
on and on everything you could see can

399
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,679
be understood better if one assumes the

400
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,480
energy of light is this continuously

401
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,798
distributed in space according to this

402
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,798
assumption to be contemplated here when

403
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,519
a light Ray is spreading from a point

404
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,639
the energy is not distributed

405
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,519
continuously over ever increasing spaces

406
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,919
but consists of a finite number of

407
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:49,639
energy Quant that are localized in

408
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,360
points in space moved without dividing

409
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,720
and could be absorbed and generated only

410
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,719
as a

411
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:02,158
whole okay how do you get a wavelength

412
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:02,158
which is a in a mathematical

413
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:11,280
Point okay Robert milikin tested

414
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,400
Einstein's idea that if you shine light

415
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:17,960
on a plate electrons jump out and you

416
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,240
can measure the speed of those electrons

417
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,679
or its kinetic energy by putting a

418
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,599
negative charge here and preventing them

419
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,840
from jumping off the plate he did that

420
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,199
and he found out as you increase the

421
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:36,240
frequency of light you increase the

422
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,600
kinetic energy of the um of the

423
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,640
electrons and the slope was exactly

424
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:43,439
equal to Plank's constant first

425
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,640
measurement of Plank's

426
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,960
constant okay then Johanna Stark said

427
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,080
well if this light thing is a particle

428
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,079
that's moving in One Direction it must

429
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,879
have linear

430
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:56,960
momentum so we know the energy is HC

431
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,240
over

432
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,558
wavelength in mechanic X linear momentum

433
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,120
energy is equal to the linear momentum

434
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:08,519
times the velocity of that ball so for

435
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:11,759
light Quantum it would be equals

436
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:15,798
PC so for a like Quantum the linear

437
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:17,798
momentum would be e over C which is H C

438
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:20,918
over wavelength C which would be

439
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:23,359
wavelength over I mean plug constant

440
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:26,640
over wavelength that's the linear

441
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,359
momentum of a photon the shorter the

442
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,278
wavelength the greater the momentum you

443
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:32,719
kind know that x-ray would like knock

444
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:33,759
you over where radio wave would just go

445
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,240
through

446
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:39,599
you actually I want to do you a little

447
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,159
calculation for you because Einstein was

448
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:46,319
really kind of screw on his okay so if

449
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:50,000
classically P equals MV and for like

450
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,000
Quantum P would equal

451
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:59,480
MC and since we know that eals PC or P

452
00:21:54,359 --> 00:22:00,959
equal e over C then P equals e over C MC

453
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,640
just take this

454
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,960
part move the C over and you get equals

455
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,679
MC s so actually I just derived equals

456
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,600
MC s only from the mechanical properties

457
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,320
of

458
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,319
light and that's kind of

459
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,720
happy uh

460
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:24,200
oh but E equals mc^2 is kind of like too

461
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,919
big because in classical mechanics the

462
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:31,840
energy equals 12 MV

463
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:33,960
s so forant Quantum that would be 12

464
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,399
mc^2 so where' the other half of the

465
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,400
energy

466
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:42,840
go I'm want to answer that in a

467
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,600
minute one more thing Richard Beth

468
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:48,879
measured the anual momentum of light

469
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:52,079
angular momentum classically is the mass

470
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,679
times the angular frequenc angular

471
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,678
velocity times the

472
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
radius he sent polarized light through a

473
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:03,960
b refringent plate and it rotated and he

474
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,720
measured the angular momentum of each

475
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,079
Quantum was H over 2 pi actually

476
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,880
independent of wavelength and frequency

477
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:14,960
it's the same for every single Photon

478
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,520
wherever you are that's ual

479
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,200
momentum so this is the quantum

480
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,158
mechanical Photon it has a speed a

481
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,440
wavelength a frequency an energy a

482
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,080
linear momentum and angular momentum

483
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,558
although since it's a mathematical Point

484
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,278
nothing's spinning

485
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:34,399
just a number they're all

486
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:35,919
numbers and I don't want you to

487
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,000
forget

488
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,360
interference that

489
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,880
Thomas

490
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:46,798
um

491
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,960
name Young thank you I've got to old um

492
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:52,000
new because as by hour just we know

493
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,278
there's moreo butterflies or beetles

494
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,839
that when the light hits and goes

495
00:23:55,278 --> 00:24:02,200
through a thin plate or separate at

496
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:04,399
points you get these beautiful blue

497
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,759
colors and you get those beautiful blue

498
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,640
colors as long as this distance is less

499
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:12,000
than about a wavelength so you can have

500
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,640
photons that are about a wavelength

501
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,119
apart you'll still get these beautiful

502
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,240
colors that'd be really difficult if FL

503
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:20,879
were mathematical

504
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,798
point and just because this is a plant

505
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,600
biology seminar plants also use

506
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:29,480
interference to make some of those

507
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,519
beautiful blue colors okay so Einstein

508
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,519
sort of

509
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,879
neglected

510
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:37,240
interference plank when he introduced

511
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,960
Einstein for membership nominated for

512
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,440
membership in the Prussian Academy said

513
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,480
sometimes as for instance in his

514
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,440
hypothesis of like Quant he may have

515
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,558
gone overboard and the speculation

516
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,320
should not be held against him Neil's

517
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:53,038
Bourne is Nobel dress said in spite of

518
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:55,439
its theistic value however the

519
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,079
hypothesis of L Quanto which is quite

520
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,600
irreconcilable with so-called

521
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:02,278
interference phenomena is not able to

522
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,798
throw light on the nature of

523
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:06,960
radiation Robert milikin said the

524
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,119
conception of localized light Quant out

525
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,159
of which Einstein got his equation must

526
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,479
still be regarded as far from being

527
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,799
established until it can account for the

528
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,240
facts on interference and the other

529
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:20,798
effects which seem thus far to be

530
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,319
irreconcilable with it we must withhold

531
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:26,839
our full ascent and Henrik Lauren said

532
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,480
the hypothesis of concentrated Quant is

533
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,038
directly in contradiction with with

534
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,919
observed facts namely that what is seen

535
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:36,359
in the phenomena of

536
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,520
interference but then Arthur Compton did

537
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:41,599
this great experiment it was like a pool

538
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:44,960
table he took a photon and shot it into

539
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:48,000
a electron and the electron went back

540
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,600
using up some energy and the photon was

541
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,679
scattered in this way with a little

542
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,359
longer wavelength if you use

543
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,159
conservation of momentum conservation of

544
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:59,599
energy and Einstein's special relativity

545
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:01,559
it all worked out

546
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,319
Compton got the Nobel Prize and from

547
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:07,519
then on everybody believed the photon

548
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:10,398
was a mathematical

549
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,278
point when I was working on my model I I

550
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:15,879
talked to Kurt Godfrey and he said

551
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:15,880
there's nothing here it's

552
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:25,399
done science has changed though science

553
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,640
used to be a way to understand the

554
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:31,678
world now it's a way to predict what's

555
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,038
going to happen and that's a fundamental

556
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:38,320
difference that's why I'm a

557
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:42,919
pirate I think I can safely say says

558
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:45,519
Fineman that nobody understands Quantum

559
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:48,038
mechanic David merman here at

560
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,158
Cornell declared himself to be among

561
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:52,480
those who feel uncomfortable when asked

562
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,000
to articulate what we really think about

563
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,839
Quantum Theory writing if I were forced

564
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,679
to sum up in one sentence what the

565
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:02,558
Copenhagen interpretation says to me

566
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,640
it'd be shut up and

567
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:09,158
calculate although just recently Jim

568
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:12,799
bagot and unfortunately died um halron

569
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:15,960
um started to question this lack of free

570
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:18,119
speech in science shut up and calculate

571
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,200
how Einstein lost the battle to explain

572
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,398
Quantum

573
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,720
reality actually Einstein really

574
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:25,079
questioned quantum

575
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,600
mechanics he even questioned his point

576
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,558
like Photon he wrote to Loren I'm not at

577
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,918
all the opinion that one should think of

578
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:34,480
light as being composed of mutally

579
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,000
independent Quant localized in

580
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,000
relatively small

581
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,359
spaces so I tell my students the most

582
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,880
effective tool for your career in

583
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:49,240
science is to have a

584
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,880
rug and a broom and if there's

585
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:57,200
inconvenient facts theories or whatever

586
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,200
you just put them under there

587
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,599
John F Kennedy wrote in profiles

588
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,519
encourage the first pressure to be

589
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,839
mentioned is a form of pressure rarely

590
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,200
recognized by the general public

591
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,879
Americans want to be liked and senators

592
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,640
are no exception we prefer praise to

593
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,399
abuse popularity to contempt we get you

594
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,960
we are anxious to get along with our

595
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:24,879
fellow legislators our fellow members of

596
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,600
the club to abide by Clubhouse rules and

597
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,559
patterns the way to get along I was told

598
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,558
when I answer of Congress is to go

599
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:37,558
alone but on the stairs up to our Dean's

600
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:37,558
office it says to be

601
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:44,439
defiant defy disciplinary boundaries ask

602
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:47,038
new questions Inspire pioneering

603
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,798
Solutions is it just aspirational not

604
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,759
something you should actually

605
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:54,798
do I have no sense of

606
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:58,839
self-preservation I got the courage and

607
00:28:54,798 --> 00:29:01,839
education award for being fear this when

608
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:03,798
it comes to

609
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:04,798
anything I want to tell you about my way

610
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:07,359
of doing

611
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:10,158
science so I'm looking here in the

612
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:12,240
unknown I'm using my left brain and my

613
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,320
right brain left brain's trying to take

614
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,359
things apart and analyze them get those

615
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,639
facts right brains trying to put them

616
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:21,879
together to make a picture but I also

617
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,600
turn around and I look at the past to

618
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:28,278
see if that structure is as good as

619
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:31,199
people think it is so for example a tree

620
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:32,319
may be shading all those lateral buds

621
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,399
that aren't

622
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:38,359
growing but when the trees drop down

623
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:40,359
those lateral buds have a chance now to

624
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,519
grow and I'm just looking at those

625
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:47,158
lateral

626
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:50,038
Buds kugi and ran will recognize Makoto

627
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,720
fujimura is taking those old pieces that

628
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,919
had just been laying around under the

629
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,399
rug there and getting some very fine

630
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:59,799
gold and putting them together and

631
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:01,879
making something that's even better than

632
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:06,119
the

633
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:08,240
original CP snow said that no scientist

634
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:11,518
or student of science need ever read an

635
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,960
original work of the past I'm just out

636
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:17,359
of curiosity anybody read that April

637
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:21,840
1953 paper by Watson and

638
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:24,240
Crick one two three four

639
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:26,480
five

640
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,798
okay I think it's bad advice and you

641
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,519
should go read it

642
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:34,200
okay I'm A Simple Man 1 two three

643
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,038
Infinity after that can't do enough

644
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,319
controls can't understand things can't

645
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:39,599
remember

646
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:42,519
things I'm just not smart enough for

647
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:48,119
this kind of thing so I try to find the

648
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:50,720
fewest number of First principle ideas

649
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,359
that I can put together and I have to

650
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,440
really question the assumptions to make

651
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:58,079
sure they're true and coherent

652
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,840
non-contradictory so

653
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,480
challenging two assumptions that the

654
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,240
elementary particle is not a

655
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,558
mathematical point and that time goes

656
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,960
forward and

657
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:11,119
backwards Ben Ginsburg came to my lab

658
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,200
and he was looking at the caros

659
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:17,599
cycle caros cycle is a thermodynamic

660
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,919
engine that you heat it up the Piston

661
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,278
goes up you cool it down the Piston

662
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,080
comes down and it converts thermal

663
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:26,839
energy into work

664
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:29,000
energy there's no change in entropy

665
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:31,439
there's as much entropy formed as it is

666
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,638
taken away in the cycle so there's no

667
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,798
relationship to the order of events and

668
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:38,759
time and entropy yet you can only go

669
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:41,398
clockwise in the cycle you can't go

670
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:44,359
clockwise to counterclockwise to do it

671
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:45,879
so there's an order of events in time

672
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:48,839
even though there's no

673
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,720
entropy so when Ben told me this I said

674
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:52,439
this is great I grabbed his arm took him

675
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,600
to the physical science Library which

676
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,440
existed at the time put in a VHS tape

677
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:01,959
refinement talking about the reality of

678
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,759
antiparticles and it what fan said was

679
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,399
part antiparticles are particles that go

680
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:09,480
backwards in

681
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:11,638
time so if this machine were made out of

682
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,278
antimatter according to Fineman it

683
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:16,759
should just run in the opposite order

684
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,319
but since I believe that there's only

685
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:22,158
one direction in

686
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:24,278
time and we published on this I said

687
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,039
there got to be a new symmetry instead

688
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:30,319
of having positive and negative time

689
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:31,839
let's have positive negative mass and

690
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,759
figure out all the mechanics on how

691
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,359
everything

692
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,278
behaves so I came up with a new symmetry

693
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:42,398
instead of CPT symmetry substitute a

694
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:45,880
time for ma for Mass so it said that

695
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:48,839
antimatter is the same as matter but the

696
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:52,639
charge the direction of Spin and the

697
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,638
mass the sign of the mass

698
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:59,200
changes negative mass is something that

699
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:02,918
exists in um theoretic iCal physics this

700
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,080
is um Tommy gold his Bondi who wrote

701
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,159
this Tommy gold was at Cornell and also

702
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:09,599
initially helped me with my work on the

703
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,480
photon so as botanist we know that

704
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,879
plants respond to gravity we know

705
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,399
something about gravity if I'm dealing

706
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,039
with negative Mass I wonder how it works

707
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:21,000
with

708
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:23,519
gravity his Newton's universal law of

709
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,759
gravitation this is the causal Force

710
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:30,120
this is the response Force the little

711
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:32,519
Mass moves moves in response to the

712
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:34,638
gravitational force actually if you put

713
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:37,519
these two together the little masses

714
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:40,759
cancel out which means the direction of

715
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,960
acceleration depends only on the sign of

716
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:47,879
the mass of the Earth so if that's

717
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,319
positive both negative and positive mass

718
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,240
will accelerate to the Earth this will

719
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,678
accelerate to the Earth because the

720
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,399
attractive force it goes the same

721
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,120
direction this accelerates to towards

722
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:01,518
the Earth because there's a repulsive

723
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,038
Force but it goes the other way so it

724
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,759
goes towards

725
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:08,239
ear if we made up the situation of

726
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:11,800
having a negative Mass Earth since

727
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,799
that's negative they'd both go

728
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:18,719
away actually if you have two masses

729
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:21,239
that exactly the same size the positive

730
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,078
Mass would run away from the negative

731
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,398
mass and the negative Mass would be

732
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:26,960
attracted to the positive Mass so we'd

733
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:29,719
have this thing actually Chase each

734
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,720
other

735
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:33,679
it look like this and if you want you

736
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,800
could call it

737
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,440
massless but the trouble is it will

738
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,839
chase each other to F to Infinity faster

739
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,760
than the speed of light and that's a

740
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:44,039
problem because light only travels at

741
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,560
the speed of

742
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:50,320
light I walked over to Ed Sal Peter's um

743
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:52,239
office and told him about my idea it

744
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,159
turned out he came to Cornell to

745
00:34:52,239 --> 00:35:00,639
actually work on could the photon not be

746
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:03,640
a elementary particle and um and and

747
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:06,159
um this had paper by firery and yang had

748
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:08,519
just come out suggesting that misons

749
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:10,799
weren't Elementary particles but part

750
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:14,000
matter and

751
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,839
antimatter Louis de Bry had postulated

752
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,880
this before that the photon was made out

753
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:22,078
of two semi photons made out of matter

754
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,920
and antimatter but they were massless

755
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,920
and electrically neutral

756
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:33,118
okay so plants have action potentials

757
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,320
actually the alal cells I have down in

758
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,400
my lab were the first cells that were

759
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,240
shown to have um Action potentials

760
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,519
Monday I'm giv a lecture of neurobiology

761
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,679
on plant Action potentials so we know

762
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:46,960
about plant

763
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:48,399
electricity philes took Amber anybody

764
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,800
know the Greek word for

765
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,318
Amber

766
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,519
electron so he used took Amber rubbed it

767
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:59,639
with fur and it attracts little pieces

768
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:03,119
of straw complete Botanical

769
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:06,159
experiment okay Latin word for Amber

770
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,119
suum succinic acid was first isolated

771
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:12,358
from

772
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:15,480
Amber okay and you can catch fossils in

773
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:18,598
Amber okay Cavendish made a torsion

774
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,599
balance he put these huge big lead balls

775
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,519
and saw how they attracted each other

776
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:25,000
and calculated the gravitational force

777
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,759
they said actually weighed the Earth

778
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,838
from that which in fact he did

779
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:35,280
kulum created a much smaller version of

780
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,719
this instead of N9 pound lead balls he

781
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,240
used little

782
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,598
piths from the Elderberry so if you've

783
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:43,118
done the anatomy you might have taken

784
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:45,400
the pth plants it grows out there in the

785
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,240
courtyard and I used it to help you

786
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,559
section very light and he found out that

787
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:54,759
the force of attraction or repulsion

788
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:56,880
depended on the charge and the distance

789
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:00,160
between them as well as a constant which

790
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,640
has electric permitivity of the vacuum

791
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:08,118
okay

792
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:08,118
opposite charges attract like charges

793
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:13,598
repel and if you divide the force by one

794
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:16,239
of the charge call it a test charge you

795
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,400
get the electric field around a charge

796
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,719
electric field radiates out from

797
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,160
positive charge in in to a

798
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:26,519
negative between two charges you get a

799
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:29,879
very strong

800
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:32,358
field if a charge moves you make a

801
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,079
magnetic field the more the faster it

802
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:36,799
moves this is the velocity the charge

803
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:40,480
the greater the magnetic

804
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,119
field here's another constant magnetic

805
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,760
permeability that gives you the

806
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:48,160
quantitative difference all right so I

807
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,760
have these two positive positive

808
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:51,239
negative Mass things that are moving

809
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,599
together as a photon but they're moving

810
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:56,919
FAS than the speed of light so I have to

811
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,160
slow them down to the speed of light and

812
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,159
actually speed of light is equal to

813
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:02,759
inverse of the electric permitivity and

814
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:04,719
magnetic permeability so there's some

815
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,040
electrical magnetic components there

816
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,399
that may be

817
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,159
important so if you have a positive

818
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:15,519
charge move or charge moves it generates

819
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:17,358
a magnetic field and that magnetic field

820
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,159
actually generates an electromotive

821
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:21,759
force in the opposite direction that

822
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:24,519
slows this down it's called

823
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,240
self-induction or the electronic State

824
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:30,519
and Maxwell said this is actually the

825
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:33,199
fundamental Quant qu in the theory of

826
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:36,400
electromagnetism so we have these two

827
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:38,159
charges two masses two charges the

828
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,838
positive chass moves away from the

829
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,799
negative Mass but as it moves away since

830
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:45,599
it has a charge it generates a magnetic

831
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,240
field which generates Electro motive

832
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,920
force in the other direction to slow it

833
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:53,439
down so now this catches up so you

834
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,400
actually get two particles in a wave and

835
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,800
that's what it looks like and here's

836
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,800
kind of a model

837
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:05,920
okay now I want to talk about the

838
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:10,519
rotational motion if eal mc^2 equals H

839
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,519
new then we calculate the mass of a

840
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,359
photon and if we let the angular

841
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,680
momentum equal MVR the classical

842
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:20,799
quantity and that set that equal to the

843
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:24,078
quantum quantity by doing this we use

844
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,480
Neils B's correspondence principle and

845
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:30,318
since the angular velocity is equal to

846
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,960
the angular frequency times

847
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:36,880
R we get this equation and from that we

848
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,800
can solve for the radius of a photon so

849
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,200
the radius of a photon is wavelength

850
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,318
divided by 2 pi so that's how wide it is

851
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:45,759
or half

852
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:49,400
wide so we have these two things that

853
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,119
are moving like this with angular

854
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,599
momentum so each Photon for example an

855
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:59,240
x-ray would be tiny kind of like a

856
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:03,559
particle and an INF

857
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:07,679
red um Photon would be very

858
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:11,759
wide since the radius is wavelength

859
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:15,598
divided by 2 pi the circumference is 2

860
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,560
pi r is actually equal to the wavelength

861
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,838
and that is the fundamental wavelength

862
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:19,838
in a

863
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:25,759
photon okay this looks messy but it

864
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:28,440
really

865
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,520
isn't this is the

866
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,838
three-dimensional equation for the

867
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:35,838
movement of these semi

868
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:39,599
photons there's the

869
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:42,000
radius and cosine means it's moving in a

870
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,599
certain way or sign so to have a cosine

871
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,760
and sign means it's moving in a circle

872
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,079
to have a cosine and a minus sign moving

873
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,640
in a circle in the other one so this

874
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,599
just says the photon semi photons are

875
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,799
moving in a circle and this is a

876
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,640
vibrational frequency I had to

877
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,240
just created them out of my own head to

878
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:03,039
make sure they didn't crash into each

879
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:05,318
other because if they crashed into each

880
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:06,838
other they turn into light and I didn't

881
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:10,838
want that to

882
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:10,838
happen so this is what it looks

883
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,119
like that's a

884
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,159
photon and it's difficult to see the

885
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,000
three dimensions so I divided it now

886
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,279
into to resolve what it looks like as

887
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,159
it's coming to you or looking from the

888
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,839
top and youbody see the particles in the

889
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:35,159
wave same

890
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,159
time do it

891
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:43,358
again okay Schrodinger wasn't able to

892
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,159
come up with an with an equation for the

893
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,440
photon he could come up with one for

894
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:51,118
electrons which is Spin

895
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,679
one2 and in his equation this n equals

896
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,599
one I made this n equal two for a

897
00:41:54,679 --> 00:42:00,000
photon this is the kinetic energy this

898
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,680
is the potential energy this is the

899
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,760
total energy I'm just going to say if

900
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:06,759
you solve this you can solve this

901
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,119
equation if you make a wave function

902
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:14,280
that describes your Photon so here's my

903
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:17,480
wave function in Ence cosine plus I

904
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:21,400
that's the circle and it takes a certain

905
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:24,639
amount of time to go around the circle

906
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,358
all right there's the wave function is

907
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,838
now it has this I in there imaginary

908
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:31,440
number so with the imaginary number

909
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:33,279
people don't use real space people by me

910
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,559
physicists don't use real space they use

911
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,599
what's called phase space or

912
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:40,400
configuration space or imaginary

913
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,519
time

914
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,160
okay but I look at this as a transverse

915
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,159
plane where there's actually rotational

916
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:56,240
motion p wessell in 1799 was a

917
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,960
mapmaker and he figured out that he

918
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:01,799
could use imaginary numbers to make

919
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,639
ordered peers with the xaxis gives you

920
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,200
the

921
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:07,838
longitude or the real axis gives you the

922
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:10,318
logitude and the imaginary axis gives

923
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:12,358
you the latitude just keep two numbers

924
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,400
that you can't add together it keeps

925
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:16,639
them separate is easy for the

926
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,160
bookkeeping so the energy of the um

927
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:22,838
biner Photon that was um twice as big as

928
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:25,279
just the translational energy you add

929
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:28,719
the rotational energy and you get the

930
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,440
full energy

931
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:33,799
okay now I just want to

932
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,200
add kum's

933
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,280
law to

934
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:40,799
the um wave equation

935
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,920
so

936
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,318
this um and this is the wave equation L

937
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,599
and this is kum's law we do it the X Y

938
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:53,239
and Z plane for the two photons that

939
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:55,160
gives us the electric field on each one

940
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:58,879
and I can sum them together to see what

941
00:43:55,159 --> 00:44:01,118
the electric field caused by both both

942
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,200
are also I could do the same thing for

943
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:06,039
the magnetic field and here you want to

944
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:08,239
use the velocity instead of the position

945
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:11,000
but you get the velocity no I'll just

946
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:13,799
show you in a second put them together

947
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,838
and you get the magnetic field so

948
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,880
imagine this is positively charged and

949
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:21,440
the blue one's negatively charged here

950
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,039
if they fly over this this electron here

951
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,440
they're going to add no electric field

952
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,558
they cancel each other

953
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,358
out as they widen and separate

954
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,720
they'll put a little bit of electric

955
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:35,639
field on here a lot none and then an

956
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:35,639
opposite directed

957
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:44,079
field so we actually have a sine wave an

958
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,079
electric sine wave going over that

959
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:55,079
electron and here's what it looks like

960
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,559
in Vector form the pink wave will be the

961
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,680
sinos soidal electric field and the

962
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:01,519
green will be the circular magnetic

963
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:05,598
field there'll be a quarter of a

964
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,599
wavelength out of phase in

965
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:13,440
orthogonal going to hit an electron boom

966
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,440
send it up into another

967
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,959
orbit Einstein wondered what would

968
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,639
happen if he traveled at the speed of

969
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,199
light for Maxwell's equations everything

970
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:34,838
stops so Einstein concluded time must

971
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:37,078
stop but for here it actually keeps

972
00:45:34,838 --> 00:45:40,119
going because the two thing are self-

973
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:42,519
regenerating because they're out of

974
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:44,680
phase so this is what it looks like

975
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:47,079
sinoid electric field pulls an electron

976
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:50,039
up to the next

977
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:52,039
orbital this is for hydrogen here's a

978
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:55,920
hydrogen atom there's the electron

979
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:55,920
photons coming up

980
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,960
dorion very much like

981
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,440
photosynthesis just a quick thing

982
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,040
there's kirkoff defraction equation

983
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,480
describes how things look in a

984
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:14,400
microscope it works for everything the

985
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,559
trouble is it's not consistent with

986
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Maxwell's equations okay if you have a

987
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:21,960
spherical particle in a microscope it

988
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,318
doesn't look like confocal microscope

989
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,318
doesn't look like a a sphere it looks

990
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:31,358
like this proloid

991
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:34,318
um form and kirkov defraction equation

992
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,880
describes this perfectly but it doesn't

993
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,159
it's not consistent with Maxwell's

994
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,880
equations because Maxwell's equations

995
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,558
has two waves that are in phase and

996
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,440
that's not allowed with the assumptions

997
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:48,359
of the Kirk off defraction

998
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:50,159
equation so po cor SEL Hans bet all said

999
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:53,598
Maxwell's equations don't

1000
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:57,239
work okay but everybody lets it

1001
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:59,559
go but the Viner Photon has the way the

1002
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:02,118
two Fields out of phasee there's a

1003
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:04,440
picture of the binary Photon in plain

1004
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:07,680
form in Maxwell's

1005
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,480
equations still have an electric field

1006
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,838
still have a magnetic field have an

1007
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,760
electric field magnetic field always but

1008
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:18,318
with Maxwell's equations they disappear

1009
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:22,000
and that's why they won't describe the

1010
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:24,358
fraction okay the point spread function

1011
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,838
is what we use to tell the relationship

1012
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:30,719
between our image and real

1013
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:33,039
it these are the typical equations that

1014
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:35,358
are used and actually you can't find a

1015
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,199
derivation for them anywhere Zeiss

1016
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,199
published them once that was enough but

1017
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,679
there's no derivation as a matter of

1018
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:44,719
fact they use different functions to get

1019
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:48,480
the axial resolution and the lateral

1020
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:52,558
resolution using the binary Photon I can

1021
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:55,920
make um use just one function and just

1022
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:59,000
say that the axial is about three times

1023
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,358
greater than the lateral resolution

1024
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,239
because the photon is travels about

1025
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:07,159
three times more distance than it is

1026
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:08,118
wide so taking the geometric properties

1027
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:11,279
of the

1028
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:15,200
photon okay in one cycle the photon goes

1029
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:17,519
like this and this is pi times greater

1030
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:20,679
than

1031
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:22,119
that polarized light is completely

1032
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:25,318
understandable when you have a sine wave

1033
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:27,480
like this photons have no Dimensions no

1034
00:48:25,318 --> 00:48:30,358
sidedness can't understand polarized

1035
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,639
light that's DNA is a fiber cable from

1036
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:36,279
typher Just One Last

1037
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:38,480
Thing Einstein predicted that Starlight

1038
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:41,559
would go by the Sun and have what's

1039
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,000
called a double deflection so you turn

1040
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:46,839
the telescope up higher and you see the

1041
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,119
star here even though it's really he

1042
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:53,519
said it has a double deflection because

1043
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:57,358
the mass of the Sun warps both space and

1044
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:59,679
time but what think for a second if the

1045
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:01,480
photon from the Star had zero

1046
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:04,480
translational energy it would just fall

1047
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:07,159
into the sun if it had infinite

1048
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,280
translational energy it wouldn't be

1049
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:13,759
bent the fact that it's bent twice as

1050
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:17,559
much as just a Newtonian corosal would

1051
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:21,280
be bent means it has the translational

1052
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:23,359
energy is only half the energy the other

1053
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:27,240
half is

1054
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:30,279
the rotational energy so you don't have

1055
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:32,759
to say time space is together and warped

1056
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,880
and all that stuff you can just say that

1057
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:39,160
the photon has a few more properties

1058
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:43,480
then Einstein gave it as a mathematical

1059
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:46,159
Point Loren wished that physics would go

1060
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,519
back so he can imagine things in space

1061
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:52,480
and

1062
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:54,480
time the young guy said no no no I think

1063
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,719
modern physics has definitely decided in

1064
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,000
favor of Plato in fact the smallest

1065
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:01,598
units of matter are not physical objects

1066
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,119
in an ordinary sense they are forms

1067
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,280
ideas which can be expressed

1068
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,880
unambiguously only in mathmatical

1069
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:11,960
language as ideas have no

1070
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,240
extension but I think a photon is a

1071
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,960
physical object has extension and could

1072
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:19,719
be pictured in ordinary space in time so

1073
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,798
I think on the surface quantum mechanics

1074
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:25,358
and relativity may seem to be

1075
00:50:22,798 --> 00:50:27,159
profound but deep down I think they're

1076
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:32,358
superficial

1077
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:32,358
okay that's it I'm over so any

1078
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,920
questions Wy showed sweeping things

1079
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:43,920
under the

1080
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:47,480
rug as opposed to using that as material

1081
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:50,639
for a testable hypothesis oh yeah why

1082
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:54,119
not can you not derive testable

1083
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:56,358
hypotheses from uh whatever you want to

1084
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:59,200
call the the trash you were sweeping

1085
00:50:56,358 --> 00:51:00,440
under yeah so let me give you my own um

1086
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,598
so first of all if you're going to shut

1087
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,240
up and

1088
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:07,160
calculate environment there's no test of

1089
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:09,039
hypothesis all right but I'll give you

1090
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:11,480
one of my things so I have these masses

1091
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:13,558
at the end of like a

1092
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,079
string I don't know the shape of those

1093
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:18,160
masses say they're more than a

1094
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:20,680
mathematical point then the um positive

1095
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:23,358
charge say could pull push apart the

1096
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:25,318
other possible charge and they'd split

1097
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:28,239
Point Caray say you need a point Caray

1098
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:30,159
force in order to pull them in and then

1099
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:31,759
um so if you if you have that other

1100
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:34,798
Force then what's the shape of the

1101
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,920
electric field is it exponential instead

1102
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:40,079
of linear as I showed it that's called

1103
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,639
the ukawa force there are actually uh if

1104
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:45,039
you have an open mind sweeping under the

1105
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,558
rug could just be collecting facts that

1106
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:47,558
need to be

1107
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:53,519
tested

1108
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:56,159
um I read half the

1109
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:58,480
paper right here in the early part of

1110
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:02,679
the paper today you mentioned that the

1111
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:05,358
you know the into matter creates

1112
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:09,039
possibility of you know the one chasing

1113
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:12,598
the other so translational motion how uh

1114
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:15,920
in your model does the rotational

1115
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:19,119
momentum and rotational motion come into

1116
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,480
play okay the paper discussed right

1117
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,798
translational motion but how do we get

1118
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,960
that rotation oh how do we get the

1119
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:31,599
rotation yeah oh so so um angle momentum

1120
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:35,000
is conserved yeah so once it's

1121
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:39,798
emitted it's emitted with one wavelength

1122
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:42,519
and therefore anual Mo momentum um so I

1123
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:46,318
I can just say it as an

1124
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:50,159
atom a bore atom you know each electron

1125
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:53,159
stays in its orbit because angle

1126
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:55,519
moment oh yeah and in this case we have

1127
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:59,199
two particles but there's no what's the

1128
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,199
charge between the

1129
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:03,838
um those fields that I showed you

1130
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,119
actually take into consideration the

1131
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:09,199
threedimensional

1132
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:12,039
charges that are there but it doesn't

1133
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:14,000
really answer your question yeah yeah it

1134
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:18,039
it's a sort of a description of the

1135
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,280
charges that but not an explanation

1136
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:24,159
yeah that's right that's right that's

1137
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,040
right I need to do that or we can do

1138
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,440
that how do you prevent them from

1139
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:31,440
hitting each other

1140
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:35,400
so that um longitudinal

1141
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:38,480
motion actually um prevents them from

1142
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:40,639
ever touching each other yeah yeah but I

1143
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,440
created that just on a whole cloth in

1144
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:45,480
order to make sure they don't touch each

1145
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:47,519
other but actually um it it it worked

1146
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,599
out kind of nicely the entropy of a

1147
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:53,838
photon is

1148
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:56,640
3.6k so the entropy of a single particle

1149
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:59,960
is 1 12K

1150
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:05,239
and um so you add degrees of freedom and

1151
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:08,880
you get more so 3.6k is like basically 7

1152
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:11,318
half K so you look for seven types of

1153
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,440
motion and so there should be about

1154
00:54:11,318 --> 00:54:15,920
seven types of motion

1155
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,400
but but I just sort of made up that

1156
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,960
vibrational

1157
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,440
thing I originally had a much simpler

1158
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:24,318
formula but the photons wouldn't

1159
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,838
interfere constructively and

1160
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:27,519
destructively The Way You observe so I

1161
00:54:26,838 --> 00:54:31,719
had

1162
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:34,400
to add like a square two two Pi s Square

1163
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:36,959
term and got it cosine squared instead

1164
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,960
of just go

1165
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:45,440
on uh really interesting to um I was

1166
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:47,679
wondering so the Super comium Con

1167
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:51,400
reactor in um

1168
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:53,838
Japan showed evidence for free neutrinos

1169
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,920
that are free from electrons and

1170
00:54:53,838 --> 00:55:00,159
different flavors producing different

1171
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:04,440
Halo effects and these neutrinos are

1172
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:06,000
undetectable by our sensors except when

1173
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:10,119
they interact with another particle when

1174
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,559
they hit an electron and produce light

1175
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:16,400
so how does your model account for the

1176
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:18,160
production of Light by a particle that

1177
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,039
moves faster than the speed of light

1178
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:22,879
because we assume that

1179
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:27,400
light has a set limit of its

1180
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:31,000
speed then this particle couldn't be

1181
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:32,760
carrying so um the center of gravity of

1182
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,880
the photon actually moves at the speed

1183
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,839
of

1184
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,720
light but since it's vibrating like this

1185
00:55:36,838 --> 00:55:40,440
has to move faster and slower on both

1186
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:43,879
sides the average is always actually the

1187
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:47,240
speed of so the photon itself moves at

1188
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:51,160
the speed of light um one thing about

1189
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:54,000
neutrinos U Max Bourne initially and and

1190
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:55,920
um and then de Bry thought that once

1191
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,079
neutrinos were discovered that the two

1192
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,119
part

1193
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:02,160
would be neutrinos and since neutrinos

1194
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:04,680
may or may not have a Magnetic Moment

1195
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:07,679
it's not certain and may or may not have

1196
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:09,798
a mass it's not C I mean this is is even

1197
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:12,558
more certain I think than the neutros

1198
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:16,079
the um these particles I'm talking about

1199
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:20,280
may be similar to nutral nutral and anti

1200
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:23,359
nutral so how would the interaction of a

1201
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:27,240
nutr with an electron produce photons in

1202
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:30,440
that case is it oh I I um

1203
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:32,558
I I can only answer very vaguely and is

1204
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:35,000
that if you have an interaction that's

1205
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,599
going to cause that lead to a certain

1206
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,039
energy

1207
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:42,079
production if that energy production

1208
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:45,039
could give off a photon of whatever the

1209
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:48,160
particular wavelength should be but I I

1210
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,160
can't really answer that

1211
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:54,480
question this has been a production of

1212
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:57,480
Cornell University on the web at

1213
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,480
