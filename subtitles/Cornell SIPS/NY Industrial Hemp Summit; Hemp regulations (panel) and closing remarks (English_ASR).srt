1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:13,458
yeah unfortunately you're going to hear

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:14,809
legal stuff at the end of the day I'm

5
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:16,939
going to try to keep this a little

6
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:19,278
breezy I mean what you've heard was from

7
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:21,800
your public officials all sorts of

8
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,929
excitement about the opportunities you

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,719
heard actually really fascinating

10
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:28,368
information from the researchers and the

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,169
scientists about what they're doing

12
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:33,320
really interesting stuff about the

13
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:36,800
farmers now I can get to talk about

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,869
regulations but I don't think of them as

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:43,099
regulations really I think really it's

16
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:45,468
just creating an environment hopefully a

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,588
safe environment given that farm bill

18
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:51,260
essentially creates carve outs to work

19
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:54,738
in this area and leaves it to the state

20
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:56,478
to develop a program either through its

21
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:59,658
own research program or through

22
00:00:56,478 --> 00:01:02,298
educational institutions to establish

23
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:06,260
programs which permit the research and

24
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:09,200
study of this plant and what we're

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,790
attempting to do is listen to the folks

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,140
who are interested in it listen to the

27
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:18,920
industry needs and try to form a program

28
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:21,859
that addresses the needs of Industry to

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,909
study and research and create a base

30
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:28,609
when things hopefully change in

31
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:31,670
Washington so that this industry can

32
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:35,269
really launch and grow so that's sort of

33
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:38,390
what we're up to and it's an iterative

34
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:40,939
process I mean I've been at the agency

35
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:44,019
for about four years and I think we're

36
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:47,539
on our third set of regulations in

37
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:51,859
industrial hemp which is a lot of

38
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:54,590
regulatory work what we're currently in

39
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:58,150
the process of doing now is taking what

40
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:01,430
we built on and expanding it so that are

41
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,200
essentially private partners have rules

42
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,080
of the game we've adopted program

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,820
regulations in connection with the six

44
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,870
sites which were available under our

45
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:13,729
current law as you've heard we've now

46
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:16,639
well with with current legislative

47
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:19,158
session we've essentially eliminated

48
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,750
that tent site limitations so there's a

49
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:23,389
large opportunity for Pete

50
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,060
who are interested in the area to make

51
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:27,769
application to the department to engage

52
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,129
in the study and research industrial

53
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:34,010
hemp and the range of I guess the range

54
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:36,139
of research is almost as broad as the

55
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:38,359
number the huge number of applications

56
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:40,669
for this particular product so while

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,830
we're in the AG department we often

58
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:46,639
think about agronomic research I mean it

59
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:48,680
goes from agronomic research to you know

60
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,449
setting cultivars growing conditions but

61
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,300
it also involves market research and

62
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:56,689
production so it's an entire array of

63
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,939
possibilities some of which we are quite

64
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:01,039
familiar with and some of which we

65
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:03,560
haven't traditionally been involved in

66
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,239
so it's a learning process on our part

67
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,270
one of the fun things about listening to

68
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,159
all these panelists is a lot of it you

69
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,110
sort of going yeah I learned that but

70
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,090
there's so much more to learn so from

71
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,830
the legal side it's a really exciting

72
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,209
area because it both exposes your

73
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,130
knowledge base and also your profound

74
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,729
ignorance without what can happen so

75
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:27,889
it's sort of like a lot of fun because

76
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:29,329
one a lot of the things we see and that

77
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:32,149
the department has done has been done

78
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:34,519
over time and it's a building effort and

79
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,469
we're dealing with structures that

80
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,860
already been created this is a new

81
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:42,949
opportunity it's a new program so you

82
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,440
can form it and mold it and try to make

83
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:47,929
it work as efficiently as possible which

84
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:53,000
is both challenging and is an exciting

85
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:55,090
so it's interesting for me hopefully

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,419
it's interesting and useful for you and

87
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:02,599
I can't emphasize how important it is to

88
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:05,149
get input from the folks who are there

89
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,650
in the fields doing the research doing

90
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,890
the growing and getting information

91
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,049
because I mean regulations just really

92
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:14,629
rules of the game so we try to create

93
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:18,918
certainty and clarity everyone knows

94
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:21,680
what's going on and you can perform in a

95
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:26,089
relatively easy environment they cost

96
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:30,228
what's required is clear and it's it

97
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:33,060
addresses sort of your needs so saying

98
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:36,599
all of that i'll give you a breezy intro

99
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,939
duction to what our program currently

100
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,030
looks like and essentially will look

101
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:44,459
like because it's really it's pretty

102
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:45,959
simple notwithstanding and the

103
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,829
challenges we're working in a murky

104
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,489
federal environment so you've got

105
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:52,349
transitioning where you've got

106
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,449
carve-outs under the federal farm bill

107
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,010
you've got additional supplements in

108
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:58,110
connection with the omnibus budget bill

109
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:00,089
which expands sort of the range and

110
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,840
scope of these activities but they're

111
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:04,739
not particularly fleshed out you've got

112
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,339
uncertainty at the federal regulatory

113
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,199
level when you speak to the agencies um

114
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:12,689
they're sort of tentative in their

115
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,490
approach because it's new to them and

116
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:17,279
the states are the ones who are really

117
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,829
developing these programs so in some

118
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,109
ways we have lots of opportunity but in

119
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:24,359
certain sense were also on our own in

120
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,180
trying to develop programs that serve

121
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,669
the needs of the industry and serves the

122
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,918
needs of public and that's sort of what

123
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:34,379
we're up to so essentially it currently

124
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:38,399
we've got a research program we're

125
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:40,469
accepting private partners we also work

126
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,239
with educational institutions but

127
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,310
generally our approach to both of these

128
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,288
entities is pretty much the same you've

129
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,699
got an application process the

130
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:50,879
application is fairly straightforward

131
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:54,029
and the information that is required is

132
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,538
fairly directed we obviously as required

133
00:05:54,029 --> 00:06:00,059
by law require disclosure of the sites

134
00:05:56,538 --> 00:06:02,370
we are looking for for research

135
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,978
proposals because ultimately our pilot

136
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,550
project projects our pilot projects for

137
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:10,019
research and study so when you know Dan

138
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,970
tells us you got to be thoughtful and

139
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,449
you've got a plan that's true in terms

140
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,100
of your approach to this agency as well

141
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:20,728
because what we're looking for is a

142
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,280
thoughtful plan as to what areas you

143
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:24,839
would like to work in and develop which

144
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,899
contributes to the knowledge and the

145
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:32,310
development of this particular industry

146
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:34,769
but it's research and study based and it

147
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,288
also needs to be appropriately scaled to

148
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:40,319
the project that you're proposing so I

149
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:42,509
mean we've had suggestions in our

150
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,579
regulations that agronomic research and

151
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:46,089
marketing research but but essentially

152
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,370
what you really need to

153
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:50,709
due to have a successful application is

154
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,930
to think about what you want to research

155
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:55,149
what areas can be developed and then

156
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,759
make the proposal to the agency and

157
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:59,739
we're pretty flexible but you need to

158
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,379
develop that it's got to be serious it's

159
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,930
got to be thoughtful and if it is then

160
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:07,540
chances are you're going to be reviewed

161
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,699
favorably you also need to think about

162
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,979
security issues now security issues from

163
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,860
our experience has been sort of

164
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:19,060
interesting when we first embarked upon

165
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:22,479
looking at regulations there was a huge

166
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:26,500
security concern and we were thinking

167
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:28,360
that we really needed very structure a

168
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,550
very structured approach to the kind of

169
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,840
security that was necessary for folks

170
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:37,000
cultivating industrial hemp and as we

171
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:40,168
learned more about other states

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,180
experience and other growers experience

173
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:45,279
we had a much softer approach and

174
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,949
currently while you need a security plan

175
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,879
the security plan needs to be a sensible

176
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:56,050
one you need to consider what kind of

177
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:58,629
access there is to the the plants being

178
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,180
grown or access to the facility and we

179
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:04,209
don't have any specific requirements but

180
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,220
what you really need to do is assess the

181
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:08,439
risks that you may have in connection

182
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,229
with security issues and then adopt

183
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,389
appropriate responses to those risks so

184
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:15,519
it's a more flexible approach it's not a

185
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,590
top-down you've got to fence you're

186
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,439
growing areas you've got to have a

187
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:22,509
particular kind of signage but it's more

188
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,069
of an iterative process where you think

189
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:26,439
about what your problems could be and

190
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:29,379
how do you address them and that sort of

191
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:32,168
the approach we've taken um I'd also

192
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:33,759
mention that the scale is important

193
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:36,069
we're talking about demonstration

194
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:39,069
projects so that doesn't necessarily

195
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,080
need to be really really tiny but it

196
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:44,260
needs to be appropriately scaled so what

197
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:48,400
you're researching is appropriate to the

198
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:51,059
America going to be cultivating um there

199
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,470
are obviously issues in connection with

200
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:55,359
what we do in evaluating I mean

201
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,800
basically we will be looking at

202
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,990
background checks

203
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,059
and we will be looking at no past

204
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,350
experience it was sort of interesting in

205
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:06,309
our discussions with other state

206
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,990
agencies this was an area that people

207
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:10,479
identified yeah there's a concern here

208
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,060
we had applicants who had all sorts of

209
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,470
issues be at regulatory or otherwise so

210
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:16,719
you need to be mindful and make sure

211
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,060
that the folks you partner with in

212
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,240
research are responsible individuals and

213
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:24,699
that's sort of what we're looking for so

214
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,950
you know their requirements for

215
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:36,040
disclosure and you take a look at that

216
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:39,070
um we basically requiring our partners

217
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,469
to enter into partnership agreements or

218
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,060
research partner agreements and

219
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,528
basically that's your roadmap you're

220
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:46,149
going to have a regulatory structure

221
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:48,759
which gives you sort of like the general

222
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:51,399
marks you need to hit in connection with

223
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,230
what's expected of you as a research

224
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,539
partner that's dealt with in our

225
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,278
research partner agreement and basically

226
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:59,708
what that does is a thai buddhist scope

227
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,480
of work so basically you undertake to

228
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:04,208
conduct a project and we expected to

229
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,430
adhere to that project um it's flexible

230
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:08,799
enough to modify as you're going on so

231
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:11,109
that if you want to go into related

232
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,759
areas you can but if it's a separate

233
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,440
research project then you'll have to do

234
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:18,189
a separate application but there's

235
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:22,029
flexible it provides for disclosures and

236
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:24,760
vetting it makes clear that once you get

237
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:27,429
a permit that it's not transferable

238
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,259
permit it permits subcontracting we have

239
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:31,120
reporting requirements so I mean

240
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,799
basically if you're involved in a

241
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,929
project will be annual reporting

242
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,639
requirements providing data but at the

243
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:38,078
same time or research partnership

244
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,970
agreement protects your intellectual

245
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,569
property at which you develop is yours

246
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:45,850
and we make it clear that it's he was so

247
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,778
that's covered in our agreement we deal

248
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,709
with with testing regimens and

249
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:52,570
procedures to make sure that it is

250
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,768
indeed when you get it its industrial

251
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:57,579
have been where you grow it its

252
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:59,948
industrial hemp um in sit I want one of

253
00:10:57,578 --> 00:11:01,929
the useful things for us in connection

254
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:03,578
with sitting through this summit we

255
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:06,489
heard issues with respect to hot seed

256
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:09,079
and that's something that we probably

257
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,690
need to take a closer look at

258
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,430
because this is a new issue that I don't

259
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,890
know Chris had seen it but it was a new

260
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:18,199
issue for me and it's something that we

261
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:19,819
deal with in our partnership agreements

262
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,870
but it's something I think we maybe want

263
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:27,110
to kick the tires a little better on we

264
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:31,190
deal with the security so so that that's

265
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:32,840
sort of the structure of our program it

266
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,790
was the structure of the program before

267
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:42,230
it's a little bit more formalized now

268
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:46,879
and that's sort of where we are um one

269
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:50,289
of the things i would encourage you all

270
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:53,450
to do because we will be formulating

271
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:55,429
regulations and there's a lot of public

272
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:58,100
comment and we look forward to that

273
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:01,639
comment both during once we publish

274
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:06,500
regulations we get comment but even now

275
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:09,289
before they get published give me a call

276
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:13,279
talk to us if there are issues we need

277
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:14,779
to focus on you are the best folks to

278
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,610
advise with what those issues are

279
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:20,240
because you're working in the field hey

280
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:22,879
I'm just a lawyer but and and I can

281
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,029
create clear regulations i can create

282
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:29,600
clear rules but basically it's your

283
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:30,980
knowledge base that helps me get to a

284
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,080
position where everyone knows what's

285
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:37,940
going on and we can do a program that

286
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,240
works for you because ultimately that's

287
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:45,020
what our job is to create a clear set of

288
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:48,830
rules that you can understand and you

289
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:53,059
can follow and creates a space for you

290
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:56,810
to operate that won't run into problems

291
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:59,209
with federal authorities and that's what

292
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:04,509
I've got to say thank you Scott

293
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:08,780
[Applause]

294
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:10,309
so I thank you Scott so I think the one

295
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:12,049
thing that I would reiterate I don't

296
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:14,689
have a great deal to add to what Scott

297
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:16,639
has has talked about this afternoon on

298
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,290
the regulations but I think going

299
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,019
forward one of the things I'd like to

300
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:24,589
reiterate which Scott brought up is is

301
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:26,329
the importance of in the application

302
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,160
process and in the regulation the

303
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,139
importance of formulating the research

304
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:34,699
questions and articulating that in a

305
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:36,740
clear way to us you know up until now

306
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,870
this has been a this has been a program

307
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,600
where we had a limitation of 10 permits

308
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,190
and there has been the ability to have a

309
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,409
great deal of interaction with

310
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,380
applicants and also the ability to have

311
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:50,629
us when we get an application and we

312
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:53,450
have questions to call people and

313
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:55,189
clarify and I think as this goes forward

314
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,080
based upon the interests that I've seen

315
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,970
here today in the and the number of

316
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,850
phone calls I've had as we go forward

317
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:04,250
and this becomes a higher volume program

318
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,710
for us if you will it's going to be very

319
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,570
very important that when the research or

320
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:11,300
when the applications come in to us that

321
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:14,150
the research questions are well thought

322
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:16,129
out and I guess one of the things that I

323
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,230
would would throw out there to people as

324
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:20,149
well as you know Scott and myself and

325
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:24,340
other staff at AG and markets being

326
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:26,809
available you know to to help is also

327
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,210
you know the folks who have sort of gone

328
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:31,099
before whether the morrisville folks who

329
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,200
are the Cornell people or the

330
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,080
Cooperative Extension people out there

331
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,600
who can help you to formulate a good

332
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,570
research question and get a get a strong

333
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,070
proposal in to us you know it takes the

334
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,840
same amount of effort to look at

335
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,060
something that's strong as well written

336
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,740
versus something that that perhaps is

337
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:51,259
not as strong so I think that's going to

338
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:56,389
be really important as the volume of the

339
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:59,450
program increases all right we're going

340
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:01,669
to entertain one question because we're

341
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:05,180
running up against the end of our lease

342
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:07,559
time here in this space but one question

343
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:08,879
that producers have been asking is

344
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,829
you know and I think it's a valid

345
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,139
question does growing hemp negate the

346
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,900
ability to participate in any other

347
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:21,720
federal programs give them the federal

348
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:24,539
rules about growing cannabis an

349
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,990
interesting question I don't practice in

350
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:29,639
the area so give you a non-legal

351
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:32,159
response which doesn't find the agency

352
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:36,809
this is a high opinion there's a lawyer

353
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:40,049
coming out under the federal farm bill a

354
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:45,389
car that was created it authorizes these

355
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:47,819
programs my approach or my thought would

356
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:50,759
be in that you have a specific federal

357
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:55,350
carve out it would be inappropriate for

358
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:57,509
a federal agency to tell you that this

359
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,509
is going to disqualify you from other

360
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:04,919
available federal programs that's just

361
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:08,159
my personal analysis of it the federal

362
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:12,209
agencies may beg to differ but that's

363
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:16,019
just where I am awesome Chris any less

364
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:18,680
up alright a round of applause for these

365
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,679
two please

366
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,350
[Applause]

367
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:25,699
we've had a great day here I think it

368
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,399
was a great morning it was a great

369
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,920
afternoon we've had great panels I think

370
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,309
hopefully you've learned at least as

371
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:35,958
much as I've come to understand I think

372
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:38,328
we heard a couple of things to one we

373
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:42,139
heard the need to go forward in a

374
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:44,989
collaborative manner the need for state

375
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:48,259
agencies to have kind of a uniform

376
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,909
protocol and I'm thinking in my case of

377
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:53,419
Department of Agriculture Department of

378
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:55,338
Health Department of Justice and are

379
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:57,649
frankly our funding partners at empire

380
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:59,060
state development as well I think we

381
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,730
heard about the need for continued

382
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:04,879
research applied research while

383
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,650
varieties about fertility about

384
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,360
utilizing the rate equipment the right

385
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,130
cultural methods what does this mean for

386
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:13,938
rotations there's all kinds of questions

387
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:17,449
that we have which frankly kind of

388
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:19,490
conjures up in my mind integrated plant

389
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:21,829
science isn't that what we're talking

390
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,230
about here a little plug for Cornell

391
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:26,318
there I think we heard a little bit

392
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:30,980
they're quite a lot about the need for

393
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:34,279
federal advocacy to help lift that cloud

394
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,798
that we're still operating under adjust

395
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,410
in that last question and I'm going to

396
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,150
borrow a little bit from something that

397
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:45,200
Dan Dahl gen from JD farm said this

398
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:47,509
morning I think that I think we need the

399
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,179
correct interaction between all the

400
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:53,629
state agencies and our partners I think

401
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:55,790
we need the leadership here at the land

402
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:59,630
grant system is we've evidence today

403
00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:00,980
quite a lot the leadership from the

404
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,320
industry which i think is certainly

405
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,650
clear to me here from this meeting today

406
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:09,230
and exemplified in our panels but also

407
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,690
the leadership at the state level which

408
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,308
I think we've clearly demonstrated by

409
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,410
the participation of our lieutenant

410
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:19,339
governor and by the governor's actions

411
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:21,798
in this in this new opportunity and you

412
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:23,928
combine that with a vision and I think

413
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:28,160
it needs to be a common vision that we

414
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:29,690
all share and that we stay close to so

415
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,269
that let me just say we're committed to

416
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,460
that thank you for being here thank you

with the legislation to make this

422
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,720
possible and certainly a special thank
