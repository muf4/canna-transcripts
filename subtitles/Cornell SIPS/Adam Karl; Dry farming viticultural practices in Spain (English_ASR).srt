1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,350
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,349
University

3
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:11,929
hi everybody it's good to be back so

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:14,929
first I want to give a little spiel

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:17,899
about the Pritchard career fellowship

6
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:20,300
Awards so it was started in 1956 by

7
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:23,059
Frederic career and it's available to

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,749
plan students and landscape architecture

9
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:29,509
students at Cornell to leave you know to

10
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:31,608
study plants like a horticultural topic

11
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:34,130
of their choosing outside of the United

12
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:36,200
States in Canada and so this has been

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,150
going on for over a papist entry it's

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,670
funded by an endowment so it's not just

15
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:42,619
for horticultural students it has to

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,620
follow horticultural topics so right now

17
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:47,530
we have a Plant Pathology and a plant

18
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:49,969
breeding student that are also away on

19
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:53,149
country or fellowships right now

20
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:57,649
Meaghan Hall isn't in Tasmania she works

21
00:00:53,149 --> 00:01:00,710
on I cotton grape sour rotten with Wayne

22
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:03,439
Wilcox and James Keach works on

23
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,868
inpatient breeding and he's in Thailand

24
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,030
right now and he was working on the

25
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:10,938
propagation of orchids and so there's a

26
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,590
real big there's a rich history and a

27
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:15,319
plethora of topics that people have

28
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:18,950
studied on this award and a big part of

29
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:20,269
it is to you know I'm thinking I'd just

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,100
like to get an experience not

31
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:23,658
necessarily just study one thing in

32
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:25,449
particular for the purpose of doing

33
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:28,399
research to produce a product but to

34
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,590
before I put that recipient to get to

35
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:32,599
experience how things are done like how

36
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,210
plants are grown in a different part of

37
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:38,718
the world so like Don mentioned I had

38
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:40,309
worked in in California and in Chile

39
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:43,938
which are more Mediterranean climates

40
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,490
and then it was a big shot coming to you

41
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:49,129
know to upstate New York to see how

42
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:50,958
things are grown here and you know I've

43
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:53,568
certainly learned I get learned a ton

44
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,639
and like during my master's and but I

45
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:57,228
wanted to take a look at Spanish major

46
00:01:55,638 --> 00:02:00,828
cultural practices for a number of

47
00:01:57,228 --> 00:02:03,590
reasons so I'm familiar so it has a long

48
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:06,919
history of viticulture this is like a

49
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,259
mosaic in medida which is from the Roman

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,360
era wines been being has been made in

51
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:14,469
Spain for over 3,000 years there are

52
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,650
hundreds of rivals native to the area

53
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,259
they

54
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,519
have more vineyards you know more area

55
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:21,859
planted a vineyard than any other

56
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,049
country in the world and Spain but they

57
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,480
ranked number of fourth in the world and

58
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:31,459
wine grape production largely because

59
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:33,530
it's a really dry area that I've ever

60
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:37,009
sees of little precipitation and they

61
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,688
don't have good access to irrigation

62
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:43,039
yeah like sources to irrigate with and

63
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:46,098
in fact until 1996 it was illegal to to

64
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,169
irrigate vineyards and Spain they have

65
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:50,209
made that legal since and so that's

66
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:52,488
starting to pick up but with such a long

67
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:55,299
history of dry farming it is something

68
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:58,099
that really interested me you know -

69
00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:00,489
especially with water becoming you know

70
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:03,048
such a hot-button issue when it comes to

71
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,549
vertical term in terms of farming and

72
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,560
like if you take a look at the

73
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:08,389
California will see you in half what and

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,699
I how things evolve down I'm also put in

75
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,889
Spanish so that make things easy - like

76
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:15,858
for me to get around so fortunately and

77
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:18,170
I was able to like to start to head out

78
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:23,000
like the head over in August I love to

79
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:25,789
go to Spain so as you can see Spain has

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,229
these really tall mountains going right

81
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,388
up right across the top of it so they

82
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:30,649
have the Pyrenees right here and then

83
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:34,189
you have the Cantabrian mountains the

84
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:37,579
Pecos the the Europa that really I sever

85
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:40,729
off the rest of the Iberian Peninsula

86
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:43,609
from like from northern Europe and this

87
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:45,828
makes I go like has a rain shadow across

88
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:47,629
the entire area you also have like so

89
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:49,579
this is like a map that shows altitude

90
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:52,098
not dryness so you can see that they

91
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:54,799
have this large central plateau the mist

92
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:56,500
at the center out and so you have like

93
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,569
this area that's relatively dry and

94
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:03,500
relatively high in altitude here is a

95
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:04,668
map that shows you like precipitation

96
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,870
throughout the country so you can see

97
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:07,909
that the majority of the country

98
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,359
receives somewhere between three hundred

99
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:14,239
to seven eight hundred milliliters of of

100
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:16,699
water a year and you can see that along

101
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,899
the top you have this big band formed by

102
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:20,120
the mountains in here it's Galicia

103
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:23,209
Winston I can a story as soon as Green

104
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Spain I talked more about that area but

105
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:27,509
you can see where the vast majority of

106
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,629
you know Spain is I

107
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:32,550
there sits in this rain shadow so the

108
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,959
first place I want to go I went to go

109
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,930
visit when I went there was to visit my

110
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,339
friend Ignacio I met Ignacio about five

111
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,500
years ago when I was living in Peru

112
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,629
I was his English teacher immediately I

113
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,639
was a great English teacher I think my

114
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:45,959
better horticulturist then I am a

115
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,379
Spanish teacher

116
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,629
uh-uh English teacher sorry but he since

117
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:54,180
received a job promotion and now lives

118
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:56,850
in Madrid and so it was I have to say

119
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,079
like it was wonderful having him and his

120
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,000
family there if I ever wanted a

121
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,399
home-cooked meal and I was in town was

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,980
always there I could leave extra extra

123
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,729
things there and but the first the first

124
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,259
place we went was up to sign de gallo

125
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,450
and up here in these mountains here we

126
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,329
are and so it just shows you this giant

127
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:16,490
like that's what like severs the rest of

128
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:19,560
Spain from France

129
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,879
like that's France right here along like

130
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,370
a border goes right along the top to

131
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,769
those mountains and so that's what

132
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,500
really divides you know Spain from the

133
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:31,049
from the rest of Europe I also went out

134
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,310
there to go to the Pyrenees where there

135
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,160
are no vineyards right off the bat

136
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,350
because in August Spain really goes on

137
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,510
vacation I thought that it was just a

138
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,100
term that people said let's say

139
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:44,519
Europeans go on vacation and August but

140
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,810
really the country shuts down yes there

141
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,449
are lots of cities centres that are just

142
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,850
really empty and vacant then but

143
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,289
afterward next so I decided to go see a

144
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,330
couple of places that had really wanted

145
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,620
to see and then I could focus on being

146
00:05:54,329 --> 00:06:00,389
able to visit a lot more professionals

147
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,699
later and so my first trip to study you

148
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,680
know a grapes went down into Mumbai

149
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,789
which is and Andalusia and southern

150
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,470
Spain because they're starting to

151
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:11,160
harvest you know I guess so they

152
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,410
couldn't go on vacation and so redonda

153
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,560
is most famous for its bridges this was

154
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,840
built in the 18th century they have

155
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,100
several of them that span these giant

156
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:26,459
gorges up on this major patio where

157
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,140
ronzo States but it is okay used to be

158
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:30,539
in the Roman era a major production of

159
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,899
grape vines after flocks for a hit they

160
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,270
really pared down but now you can see so

161
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:38,489
these are olive groves right here

162
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:39,069
vineyards and all of this is wheat

163
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,470
production

164
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:44,250
primarily but during the summer I feel

165
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,510
harvest in late spring early summer and

166
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,529
you'll have a lot of barren grounds from

167
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,939
there so it's um

168
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:50,729
really sort of like really shocking to

169
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:53,110
see I ain't no there's like vibrant lush

170
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:56,410
grape canopy is coming out of this area

171
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:59,530
that's otherwise so brown and so I went

172
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:03,700
to discuss Olivia Howe it's a winery in

173
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:05,979
a 16th century monastery and they found

174
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:08,379
these paintings behind layers of plaster

175
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,210
and paint it's and they just decide to

176
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,009
over to restore them but it's a

177
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:13,810
beautiful beautiful place and when like

178
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,810
I hung out with their knowledge is

179
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,360
descent they and showed me around their

180
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,730
vineyards and so they do a lot of really

181
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,530
interesting things as like in comparison

182
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,230
to other areas that I'm used to

183
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:28,329
they like to try and crop heavier and

184
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:31,090
not leaf pull like you would think in

185
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:33,279
many areas not because like to have more

186
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:34,629
protection for the grapes to just hit

187
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,219
them you can see that this is what the

188
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:37,449
campus look like so they have that

189
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,580
really cuts down on their labor costs

190
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,649
where they don't like what they have to

191
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:44,589
do very little they don't really have to

192
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:46,779
do much in terms of hedging etc because

193
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,250
the vine just can't grow that much as

194
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:51,699
far as other interesting practices

195
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,740
they'll plant vines and they'll after

196
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,379
the first growing season they'll cut

197
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,300
them down to just two buds on the Scion

198
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:00,430
just so they can promote all of that

199
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:04,230
nice and I get more resources towards

200
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:06,430
root growth in those first years and

201
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,200
yeah if something really really tasty

202
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,660
one but this is a growing region it

203
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,209
hasn't been active starting to have a

204
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,340
renaissance of growing grapes after it

205
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:18,639
got shut down for a while another area

206
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:21,699
that I visit which is a little bit

207
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,240
further to the east by the town of Napa

208
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:27,219
is like or these vineyards which are if

209
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,650
I'm at about a thousand meters here and

210
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,110
you can see the ocean after this is the

211
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:35,860
Mediterranean down here by this up these

212
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,360
windy roads that are yeah so as the crow

213
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,620
flies you're only a couple of kilometers

214
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,450
away from the ocean but you're up really

215
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,159
high and these are Muscat Olivia and

216
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,690
Vidya

217
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,459
grapes and so this has a really

218
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,120
interesting history because they were

219
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,629
originally used to make wine

220
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,240
historically but by the

221
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:55,159
it's a Muscat a white Muscat grape but

222
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,690
they were kept in the region by the

223
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,309
Moors when they came by because they

224
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,810
make great raisins but now there's a

225
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:01,518
move to take these already existing

226
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:04,039
vineyards then shift them from raising

227
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,828
production towards wine production and

228
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:09,500
they make a really lovely white wine

229
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:13,399
it's a dry it's a dry musk outline so it

230
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,559
has those egg terpene neck type type

231
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,778
notes those overripe honey tip flavors

232
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:20,619
but it's a dry wine it's it's really

233
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:24,528
nice if you can you can find a bottle

234
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:27,169
but after that I went to hit a switch is

235
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:29,000
by the city of of cavies which is here

236
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:30,769
and it's where sherry is produced and

237
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,480
this is one of my favorite places that I

238
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:34,250
got to visit in Spain I didn't really

239
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,940
think that I didn't know that much about

240
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:41,419
sherry it's has this reputation maybe

241
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:44,120
like past generations really I'd like to

242
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:47,028
drink sherry as an after after dinner

243
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,879
drink and a big reason why it's a as big

244
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:52,759
as it is is that it sits right by the

245
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:55,610
port city of Cadiz Cadiz is the oldest

246
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,230
city in Western Europe the Phoenicians

247
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,550
founded it about three thousand years

248
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:03,050
ago people have been making wine there

249
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:05,929
for three millennia and sherry is made

250
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:09,258
in three cities so heba is Santa Marta

251
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:11,299
and son Luke are and between this

252
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:14,089
triangle is where all of the grapes are

253
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:19,129
grown primarily Palomino is the name of

254
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:22,459
the grape and then aged in wineries in

255
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:23,899
these three cities and so this is what

256
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,909
the area looks like it's these rolling

257
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:28,789
hills close to the ocean with these

258
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:32,120
really you know calcareous soils

259
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:34,849
anything that is green here is grape

260
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,188
vines and they crop extraordinarily

261
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,189
heavy it reminded me of Concord

262
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:42,019
production around western New York where

263
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:44,778
you have these extremely high yields you

264
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:45,649
can get up to like 20-some tons per

265
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,958
hectare

266
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:49,220
the grapes have really little acid they

267
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,958
have they don't have that much sugar you

268
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:56,360
can only ferment them up to maybe ten

269
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:58,099
eleven percent alcohol and yeah they're

270
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,789
not the only really have any flavor

271
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,730
they're kind of just a body to then do

272
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:06,240
aging with

273
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,909
and so then you have all of these sherry

274
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,190
houses where they have a system where in

275
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:13,139
order to maintain uniformity of the

276
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,080
product of sherry bill and have them

277
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:19,110
Aging in these like where they decant

278
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,910
maybe 10% down from the top this will be

279
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,740
like the youngest wine though the

280
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:24,480
coaster year they'll put 10% down into

281
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,450
here which goes down into there and then

282
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,450
on the on the floor is the oldest and

283
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,680
that will head off to market then and so

284
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,350
there's some wine in here that's

285
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,419
probably close to 100 years old it's

286
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,830
been diluted down all that time but in

287
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:39,269
order you can maintain the consistent

288
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,120
product because this has traditionally

289
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:45,090
been the sherry spent something that is

290
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,049
shipped you know it's 80 percent of the

291
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:50,610
market it goes outside of Spain still

292
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:52,500
yeah it gets really remarkable in the

293
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,139
same point and also because the grapes

294
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,120
have so little character the terroir and

295
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,029
like the difference that you get between

296
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,649
different areas really comes more from

297
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:02,970
what city look what the climate is like

298
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,149
in the city where these things are aged

299
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,980
for 25 years or so before and yet before

300
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:11,279
they're released which is really

301
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,889
fascinating there's you know part of it

302
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,379
is they have headspace in the barrels

303
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:19,649
where it's about 15 percent alcohol in

304
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:22,679
here and then a yeast layer grows on the

305
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:24,029
top layer and some on the bottle as well

306
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,199
but the yeast produce that can like a

307
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:31,049
waxy film that helps separate the

308
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,940
protected one from oxidation and it

309
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:35,429
gives it these beasty flavors so that's

310
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,290
what a Fino sherry is the more nutty

311
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:39,179
sherry as those have a higher alcohol

312
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:43,139
and those are stored without this

313
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:45,000
biological layer here yeah I can so

314
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,669
that's just straight-up oxidized wine

315
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,350
essentially that's been fortified and if

316
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:51,059
that's what the flavor you're going for

317
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,529
it makes a great wine to shuffle over

318
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:56,609
the world because like you can't really

319
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:58,919
get any worse you know yeah so you know

320
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,740
I already has it's already oxidized it

321
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:03,689
has high alcohol content so as far as

322
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,000
something that you can put in a barrel

323
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,250
and send out all over the world it's a

324
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,350
pretty resilient no I like pretty

325
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,750
resilient thing to ship so like

326
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,210
yeah that's been really interesting to

327
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,169
learn about there are a number of

328
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,700
different things that you can do a lot

329
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:20,620
Commission's to there's the biological

330
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,570
aging there are there's something in

331
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,110
between caught in Amontillado which is

332
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:28,990
just fun to say you know and then there

333
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:31,300
are like your dry sherry sweet sherry is

334
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,190
where you add you know like sweet wine

335
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:34,389
from my capital mayonnaise grapes like

336
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,190
there's too much to get into in just

337
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:38,139
like I have like 45 minutes to go

338
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,860
through everything they have these

339
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:43,360
traditional zones called to Mancos which

340
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,080
are like traditional areas where you go

341
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,710
to drink sherry

342
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,629
this is pepe and he has his family's

343
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:53,860
been running this tobacco for about a

344
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:56,710
hundred years and he try to show me how

345
00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,940
the public ortho is it's made like on

346
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:03,610
the on the bar counter yeah I was here's

347
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,940
a fun time but he also he also showed me

348
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:09,220
how like told me about a research

349
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,650
station a germ plasm collection close by

350
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,170
him that I was able to go visit which

351
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:18,100
was really fascinating so I met with dr.

352
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:19,419
Miguel Beneatha's and he is like the

353
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,920
head of the shrimp Osmond collection

354
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:24,069
it's one of the two chief germ plasm

355
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:25,719
collections in Spain and so it was a lot

356
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,670
of fun to see a lot of different

357
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,620
varieties that they have there the

358
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:31,929
clonal selection like the oldest

359
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,700
criminal selection in Spain was done in

360
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:35,229
have a hard-edged was one of the first

361
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,960
cities in the world to have electricity

362
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,460
like wine really push this like push

363
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,650
this video is like a like a really

364
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,660
wealthy the city of splendor like back

365
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:45,129
in the day and all of it was tied to

366
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:47,620
grapes and so they have a long history

367
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:50,139
of like a research going on in this area

368
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,190
so as they learn a lot from him running

369
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,899
at like walking around our research

370
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,520
station this isn't MIT this is my own

371
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:56,559
era which is one grape that they're

372
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,600
trying to bring back that's really up to

373
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,269
the area I'm really big berries as you

374
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,580
can see and they have these lines along

375
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:05,199
them they're really fascinating you can

376
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,690
see like there I am in

377
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,560
they're in a research station yeah

378
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,070
canard like they're different

379
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:15,279
fermentation trials now if there's a lot

380
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,260
of fun but then after that I shot clear

381
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,699
across Maine and up to Bordeaux because

382
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:23,529
why not no I there are like I have to

383
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,470
like like I don't know if any of you

384
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:28,750
know my Adele of ia she was a master

385
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:32,610
student in food science working in in

386
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:35,980
anology her family owns the de la vie a

387
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,389
winery in in Napa and she is currently a

388
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,909
student at the University of Bordeaux

389
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:42,069
and so when I knew that she was there

390
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:44,379
she invited me to crash on a couch so I

391
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,180
couldn't refuse that invitation also

392
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:49,210
many of you probably know miss Amanda

393
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:51,489
Sims a former student of Allen Lac so

394
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,350
she came over to and like like so we

395
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,450
overlapped and could go visit Bordeaux

396
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,740
together which was a lot of fun to have

397
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:59,530
a double companion that spoke a

398
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:03,460
smattering of French I don't speak any

399
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:05,409
French it's just none but here's a

400
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,960
general map of you Nicole Bordeaux it's

401
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:10,870
the largest appellation in France no

402
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,570
it's really the diversity there is

403
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,610
really amazing so like you have the

404
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,640
medoc around here which is more flat and

405
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,889
gravelly you have sought turns being

406
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,470
made around around ROVs then you have

407
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:25,240
the whole Sun Milian area I don't want

408
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,790
to get into too much detail on this but

409
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,320
it was really amazing to see places that

410
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:31,750
produced five dollar bottles of wine

411
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,610
versus 500 euro bottles of wine which

412
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,149
was something else you can also see that

413
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:39,700
they have really really tight spacing

414
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:41,259
yeah and so this plays out with how they

415
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,960
spray it like so here they're sprayers

416
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:46,539
really really narrow they can spray four

417
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,310
rows at one time and even though they

418
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,839
have like such tight planning maybe a

419
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:52,989
meter a meter and a half between rows

420
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,480
and maybe a meter between plants they're

421
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:58,509
able to have a really high density of

422
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,670
canopy in this you know in this system

423
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:02,500
which works out really well it also

424
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:05,649
makes the vines compete with one another

425
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,809
because they're in more wet climate so

426
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,540
that works out to their right to their

427
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:11,980
favorite you can see like how these

428
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:13,539
things look like when they sneak through

429
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,699
through these vineyards that a lot of

430
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:16,680
them have these spider looking tractors

431
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,009
that go over

432
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,610
rose which is pretty cool to see I also

433
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:23,160
got to visit

434
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:25,889
Cheval Blanc Klaus Van Leeuwen who came

435
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,660
last year I who is a professor at the

436
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,050
University of Bordeaux also does some

437
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,310
consulting work with like with Cheval

438
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:35,250
Blanc which is one of like the

439
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:36,960
highest-end Bordeaux's in the world

440
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,599
which is a lot of fun to see how they do

441
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,600
do this these are their concrete tanks

442
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,549
they look funny I get in funky there's

443
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,029
no practical reason for that just

444
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:50,039
because they look pretty I asked there's

445
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:54,210
yeah yeah they look cool but like that's

446
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:55,649
definitely reason I also was able to see

447
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,500
some really cool ground cover and

448
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,930
management practices so this is a semi

449
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,480
own block and like an assault turned

450
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,549
vineyard the older vines they because

451
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,940
the production is lower they'll leave no

452
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:10,289
ground cover whereas in a newer vines

453
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,380
they will leave ground cover to try and

454
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:16,409
équilibre the you know the two blocks at

455
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,820
cheval blanc they'll have cultivation

456
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,070
practices where they try and move the

457
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:21,629
top ten ten centimetres of ground where

458
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:24,179
they push it under the vines and bring

459
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,850
it back down to try and keep roots from

460
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,160
growing in that top layer which prevent

461
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:31,740
them from absorbing water during summer

462
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,900
rains which could help promote berry

463
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,299
splitting or the dilution of flavors so

464
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,920
it was fun to pick up a little bit of

465
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:41,220
know-how what they do around there but

466
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,230
then after Bordeaux I went to I use

467
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,850
Basco aren't here and to Gleason's that

468
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,720
this is greenspan so this is where a lot

469
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:51,750
of white wine is is made in the country

470
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,589
so here are a bunch of a winemaker I

471
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,150
forget her name I in Yaqui I think it is

472
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:58,829
like there like the bush could i names

473
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,810
are like that like the past names are

474
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:02,250
really difficult to pronounce for me but

475
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,899
she's like she had a great conversation

476
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,089
tell me about how she manages her

477
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:10,800
curbing is in this area to make Chalkley

478
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:14,220
which is a really high acid wine that's

479
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,539
grown in in pais vasco it's really

480
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,279
really interesting area it's really

481
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,480
similar to the Finger Lakes reminds me a

482
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,430
lot of the finger look except for it

483
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,589
like the palm tree is around there but

484
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,150
that's just I know you're risen I guess

485
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:25,559
that they they can survive the winters

486
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,240
it doesn't get that cold during the

487
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,240
winters but they have really similar

488
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,990
problems with down email

489
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,120
and I things of that manner here you

490
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,920
have normal VSP chalices but mostly area

491
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:38,379
they have pergola trellises where you

492
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,410
have these posts and a bunch of wires on

493
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:44,290
top where it creates essentially a roof

494
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,750
over the vineyard it allows them to

495
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:49,089
achieve much higher yields but it also

496
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,799
makes mechanisation nearly impossible

497
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:53,139
they also have these really cool

498
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,579
tractors where you have like because

499
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,440
they're still low you can't enclose it

500
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:58,240
so you have to have these really low

501
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,160
tractors to be able to get underneath

502
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,809
there and then these guys were these

503
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,690
space suits we hooked up to respirators

504
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:06,429
no order to get through there yeah so

505
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,559
again it's just like funny to see like

506
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,990
how creative people get to deal with

507
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,659
these different situations

508
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:15,880
now here's Barbara she like this isn't

509
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,370
an Albertini Oh Vineyard and British

510
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,080
buys us you can see there's a lot of

511
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:22,750
granite everywhere in this area as well

512
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:26,529
you can see the pergola system here is

513
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:29,950
supported by granite posts everything is

514
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:33,670
made of stone they're even even vineyard

515
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,620
posts it was also really interesting to

516
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,480
see the different pace of how people

517
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:39,069
work here like I was saying this has to

518
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,220
be done I like most of the work here has

519
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:44,169
to be done by hand and this is a picking

520
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:48,160
crew they're paid by our not by weight

521
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:49,420
like a car in the United States and yeah

522
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,620
people are just kind of like taking or

523
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,090
like they're kind of taking their time

524
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:54,629
guess just going through there's a

525
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:58,629
different pace to how everything is done

526
00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,850
but wages are still relatively low and

527
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:03,220
so as you can see at what the price

528
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:04,509
points of wines aren't you know in the

529
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,250
liquor store that Spain is really

530
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:08,890
competitive for especially for the

531
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,720
quality of what they produce there's

532
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,670
also a lot of people that do their their

533
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,480
own farming like on a small of us so you

534
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:18,580
can see you'll see just like a couple of

535
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,559
you know I like older women driving

536
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:23,589
around these are probably I think these

537
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,179
are la brusca grapes right here I like

538
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:27,309
they're harvesting harvesting to make

539
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,650
wine on on their own there's still a lot

540
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:31,299
of people that make their own wine make

541
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,880
their own cider I things like that and

542
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:35,109
have their own small plots now it's like

543
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,670
a big part of culture to have with your

544
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:37,129
own garden have your own small vineyard

545
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,640
their lot

546
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:42,410
people that have fairly sighs I feel a

547
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:49,220
large tracts of land that they take care

548
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:52,009
of and so after Galicia I went on to

549
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,690
Thoreau and then to Verde Verde Duetto

550
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:56,480
which are some of the more famous areas

551
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:59,630
so I couldn't think of anything more

552
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,299
unlike Galicia when I got to Touro which

553
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:05,200
is just this dry son big barren place

554
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:08,450
with really sandy soils these vines

555
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,930
they're spaced 3 meters apart thanks to

556
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,400
3 meters by 3 meters and there's really

557
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,049
there's very little work that people

558
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,730
have to do you have to cultivate once a

559
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:19,639
year in the spring because after that

560
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:23,930
nothing can can reestablish roots I'd

561
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,100
get so tried these vines are not grafted

562
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,740
there's no flux right in this area

563
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:30,559
flexure I can't I can't grow in finest

564
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,910
there the sandy and they producing like

565
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,299
a variety called Tina they thought oh

566
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:38,750
which is really really dark in rich it's

567
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:40,730
it's really interesting and but again

568
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,009
I've mostly costs or everything is hand

569
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,049
has to be hand done you have to hand

570
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:48,109
thin you have to hand prune you have to

571
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:51,829
hand pick you can't you can't mechanize

572
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:53,899
any of this and so as as things change

573
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:55,429
we'll see what the difference is I mean

574
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,100
a lot of the differences that I saw

575
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,690
between my newer vineyards and older

576
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:02,029
vineyards is trying to bring in the

577
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,769
capability to mechanize here's the big

578
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:05,119
thing so putting things on a trellis for

579
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:08,629
no other reason just to be able to

580
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,949
harvest it mechanically but it's really

581
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,530
difficult to do that when you need to

582
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,269
maintain spacing this this white apart

583
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:15,889
there are no like there like there's

584
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:18,680
nowhere to find water to irrigate here

585
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:21,920
even if you wanted to so that kind of

586
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:25,370
dictates how you know you know like how

587
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,259
are you able to grow in these areas just

588
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:30,379
to see here so this is the difference in

589
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:33,019
there so carbonic carbonic lis macerated

590
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,220
grapes neck to make wine are really

591
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:36,589
coming here you can see the difference

592
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:40,100
in color that this makes as opposed to a

593
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:42,369
traditional wine and so like adds a lot

594
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:44,168
of writing fruitiness there

595
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:46,989
like if you ever see that and it's

596
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:49,360
carbonic Li macerated it means that the

597
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,278
initial fermentation was done in an

598
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,298
absence of oxygen with whole areas that

599
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,339
fermented a little bit inside of

600
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:56,918
themselves that produced these really

601
00:23:54,339 --> 00:24:00,129
distinct flavors you should try it if

602
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:03,190
you have it and then after that I went

603
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:05,230
to pretty edited wet oh I really think

604
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,450
that so this like a newer area you can

605
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,919
see a really wide spacing there and it's

606
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,528
right by the Rio de Guero so a lot of

607
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,509
these areas have irrigation really more

608
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:15,750
of a security system than anything else

609
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:19,028
but because it's a really flat valley

610
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:22,089
they're able to take it away with this I

611
00:24:19,028 --> 00:24:24,250
have big spacing big vines a lot of the

612
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:26,199
areas are you can see there's everything

613
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:28,210
it's just on a really large scale here a

614
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,179
lot of this is because it wasn't a like

615
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,048
a big traditional wine producing area

616
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,309
and here's a view from on top of a

617
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:37,240
castle oftentimes they would have the

618
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:39,369
best views of the landscape and a lot of

619
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,990
this used to be sunflower in week and it

620
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:43,778
was only recently turned over in the

621
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,788
1980s they started to do this and so I

622
00:24:43,778 --> 00:24:47,980
think that actually a lot of the better

623
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:50,319
budget wines coming out of Spain are

624
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,778
coming from pretty bad a duet Oh or do

625
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,450
has maybe the more famous area I'm a big

626
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:56,950
big proponent and fan of things coming

627
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,649
out of pretty better they the wet Oh

628
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:01,860
especially for like your more economic

629
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,859
ones

630
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:07,210
yeah again so you have a lot of like

631
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,409
large large volume production facilities

632
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,269
most of what they go around there is

633
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:12,520
Tempranillo but I tried maybe the best

634
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:15,220
throughout my life when I was there this

635
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:18,129
is a winery called

636
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,200
bodegas we saw I was able to meet up

637
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,278
with the owner Felipe yeah actually then

638
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,590
he invited me to a both my dock

639
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:26,230
afterwards which was a lot of fun like I

640
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:27,759
don't know how I feel about that yeah

641
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,829
it's really it's really I mean like I

642
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,940
think it's something that I'm glad I did

643
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:33,398
I don't know if I'd want to go to more

644
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,710
bullfights but it's it's a really

645
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:39,969
beautiful spectacle but pretty gruesome

646
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:42,360
at the same time but yeah so so pretty

647
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:45,730
better though I don't what next is maybe

648
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:47,979
by volume I don't like this second most

649
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:50,558
important wine producing area the most

650
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,990
important one is Rioja or the most

651
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:55,099
famous one is Rioja which is situated in

652
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,829
this little Valley here so you have

653
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:59,449
of just the stunning-looking Valley this

654
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:01,339
is what it looks like there I mean like

655
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,870
there's nothing better than just getting

656
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:04,849
a rental car and cruising around these

657
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:07,879
small little towns dotted with these

658
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:10,699
medieval walled towns it's stunning it's

659
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,980
my favorite place in Spain the food is

660
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,720
fantastic as well and logo Tonio is a

661
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:18,440
city of like the capital has about

662
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,490
150,000 people in it it's a must-see but

663
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:24,890
you can see that you have this small

664
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:26,179
patchwork of you know of vineyards here

665
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,070
I mean if they've been producing wines

666
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:29,600
here for a very long time a lot of the

667
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:32,029
parcels most of them are under a hectare

668
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,339
in size and like I met some family as

669
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:37,908
they've been it had like titles to these

670
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:39,769
blocks since the 1400s yeah so it's a

671
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:41,840
really interesting area in terms of how

672
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:44,298
people able to work this with this

673
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,788
patchwork in this history a big reason

674
00:26:44,298 --> 00:26:48,859
why it became such a big famous wine

675
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:50,990
producing area is because when flocks ro

676
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:52,849
was ravaging France a lot of French

677
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,679
winemakers came to radio had they had

678
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:58,519
good connection with rail lines going

679
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:00,530
back up to France and so it's like

680
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:02,480
excellent wine grape producing region

681
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:05,450
and they brought a lot of French

682
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,700
technology of winemaking technology down

683
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,429
to down to Spain in terms of aging and

684
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,190
oak barrels different treatments like -

685
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:15,080
you know like - it really boosted the

686
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,460
quality of the wine so like so like that

687
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:19,639
potential from the grapes are always

688
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,829
there but them French influence really

689
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,360
helps it and I advanced the the quality

690
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:30,470
of their wines there and so it has a

691
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:33,918
much longer story the on like the virus

692
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,960
on the I think it is yeah these are well

693
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,538
these are also Tempranillo x' and like

694
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,750
this is later in the season closer to

695
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:43,700
harvest and Tempranillo and like your

696
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,980
think of it as if the Spanish grape that

697
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,569
is able to survive you can what you

698
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,940
think as this hot Mediterranean climate

699
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:51,889
it's a lot more finicky then then I

700
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,320
thought it was so this is relatively a

701
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:57,559
relatively cool climate in comparison to

702
00:27:54,319 --> 00:28:00,038
a lot of other areas in Spain and so it

703
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:03,230
really gets zapped when you have it in

704
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:07,059
can higher heat areas also wind can

705
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:09,370
really easily damage it shoots and so

706
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:11,289
when that happens then they'll send out

707
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:14,079
a secondary shoot and then that'll have

708
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:15,730
fruit that comes out off of a secondary

709
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:18,129
which blooms later which means that it

710
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,890
it's too late and ripeness like behind

711
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,940
the primary crop which can cause big

712
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,290
problems when you're trying to harvest

713
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,480
that block because then you'll have a

714
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:27,819
bunch of unripe fruit that's mixed in

715
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,200
which which isn't good so you want to

716
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:30,220
have it in the in the right conditions

717
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,690
to grow that I think that's why you

718
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,089
don't really see it outside Spain that

719
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:36,460
much it does really well under these

720
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:38,949
specific conditions but it hasn't really

721
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,630
adapted well hasn't really been exported

722
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,130
that well to other areas because I think

723
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,490
that there are a number of factors that

724
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:50,650
it really needs - I like to produce good

725
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:53,890
wine but you can see it up here so they

726
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,570
have the you know like the contagion

727
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,220
Mountains right up right against the

728
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:58,720
north you can see that it really stops a

729
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,880
lot of bad weather from coming in here

730
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,450
if you like if you just cross over that

731
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,890
mountain range you're in you know you're

732
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,390
on a studious you're and they like in

733
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:10,060
the can't a brain area around pais vasco

734
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,470
right up there which is a really really

735
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:15,069
green zone like from where I was showing

736
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:17,380
you those photos earlier and so yeah

737
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:24,659
it's like this really stunning landscape

738
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:27,760
Oh rose bushes yeah people say that

739
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:29,110
that's - I guess I carry in the coal

740
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,369
mine for different diseases attacking

741
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:33,909
them I don't buy that I think it's

742
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:35,139
really more of traditionally I destroy

743
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,610
Dubai is putting in marriage so that

744
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,770
horses traditionally wouldn't scratch

745
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:40,209
the end posts and dislodge them because

746
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:42,910
they were covered in thorns if that's

747
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,410
the one I think is more feasible but you

748
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:47,050
can just see it's this really beautiful

749
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:49,590
area like with this with a small

750
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:52,389
patchwork of you know vines everywhere

751
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:57,189
which is I think would be a nightmare to

752
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:58,870
think to try and control but also you go

753
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,670
up the sides of these hills into it

754
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:02,109
makes it really difficult to irrigate in

755
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:04,000
this area as well so you don't see much

756
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:05,199
irrigation also because so many of these

757
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,700
vines are so old it just be really

758
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,390
difficult to install a system that would

759
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:13,600
work but you also have a lot of your

760
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,050
older like premium wines being produced

761
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:16,980
there this is

762
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:19,889
Otacon Pompeo they have this big

763
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,110
labyrinth of caves underneath their

764
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:25,050
facility which is really something to

765
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:27,449
behold and I got like some exquisite

766
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:29,690
wine it's like fantastic but like things

767
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,250
that are normally out of my price range

768
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:35,580
like yeah so I think that were do huh

769
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:38,009
makes a great excellent wine but I guess

770
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:39,659
far as their base level like there are

771
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:42,289
other regions in Spain but I think have

772
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,430
a lot more potential than or do ha does

773
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:45,960
yeah kind of like you're fine nuanced

774
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:48,539
wines they're really good I don't think

775
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,090
they're as good as like your yeah like

776
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:52,859
your baseline make them yeah you know I

777
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:56,639
think your grad students happy type wine

778
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:59,009
they're also in the town of briones if

779
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,490
you're ever in in or do hi this is the

780
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:04,049
best wine magazine I'm a wine museum

781
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,299
that I've ever been to it cant reminds

782
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:07,710
me of the Corning Museum of Glass where

783
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:09,659
I've you all been to the Corning Museum

784
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,980
of Glass yeah where they have a great

785
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,660
science section and then they have a

786
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,360
great art section and it really ties the

787
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,150
two together absolutely I always kind of

788
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,559
interested me in bit of culture and

789
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:22,080
analogy as well here's a collection of

790
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:23,970
all of their of a bunch of different

791
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,500
corkscrews they probably thought they

792
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,569
have tens of thousands of cork screws

793
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,210
all lined up and you know according to

794
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:31,950
their different styles but they also

795
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,870
have like there's a wonderful section on

796
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:36,480
how to go grapes how to make corks how

797
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:38,039
to make barrels how to make bottles I

798
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,430
kinda make glass bottles because I have

799
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:44,069
this great technology area and then they

800
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:48,539
have a beautiful beautiful art museum

801
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:51,509
all like this dedicated to wine actually

802
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:55,529
they have all biblical scenes like that

803
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:56,940
that feature wine or cups that are ten

804
00:31:55,529 --> 00:32:00,210
thousand years old that were used to

805
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,830
serve wine from from Persia or like

806
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,779
Picasso's that feature a bottle of wine

807
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:05,639
it's really something else and plus it's

808
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:08,309
in Briones which is this beautiful old

809
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,500
medieval towns I really can't say enough

810
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:13,379
about Rydia Hyde's really something else

811
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,980
but after Rioja I started an internship

812
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,560
in the time of boertie which is an auto

813
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,400
going at the Capitol is is is that a go

814
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:22,789
support huh

815
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,620
it's a town of about 5,000 people there

816
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:27,839
isn't a whole lot going on there it's a

817
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:28,829
really agricultural town there's a lot

818
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:30,480
of fun to live

819
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:33,418
just to get that like authentic

820
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,569
off-the-beaten-path experience although

821
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:39,149
bored how recently became famous because

822
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:41,609
it is the home right next so here is

823
00:32:39,148 --> 00:32:44,609
like the owner know the head of

824
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:47,879
viticulture for Bodega spore sow who I

825
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:50,969
was working for we literally got to go

826
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,429
around to hundreds and hundreds of these

827
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:55,679
small vineyards up in these you know I

828
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:58,740
keep like a high high areas the best

829
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,320
majority is is garnacha it's also spread

830
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:06,440
in with a lot of almond orchards almonds

831
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:08,788
are going bananas up there because yeah

832
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,830
well no because because of the drought

833
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:12,690
in California it's really boosted the

834
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:15,269
price of almonds on the market and so

835
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,490
there's a big move towards almond

836
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:20,308
production and in this area they're

837
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:23,308
doing really well with that but you also

838
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:27,019
have you know all of these small small

839
00:33:23,308 --> 00:33:29,129
plots of grapes in this area as well and

840
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:30,990
so forth I was part of a collective

841
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:33,299
there are maybe 600 different farmers

842
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:35,190
some of them are a professional farmers

843
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:39,690
full-time like they'll they'll produce

844
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:42,419
olives or you know you know like almonds

845
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:44,610
or like a grapes and the collective has

846
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:47,159
to buy all the grapes there so there's a

847
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:49,168
big diversity and it can what get to

848
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,380
produce do you have wine that's made

849
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:55,830
into like five liter jugs that it sell

850
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,750
for five euros or there are like you

851
00:33:55,829 --> 00:33:59,548
know like core notches that 100 points

852
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,769
from Robert Parker and cost you know

853
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:03,119
close to a hundred dollars a bottle so

854
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:05,159
there's a really big diversity which is

855
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,768
so much fun to see such a diversity in

856
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,720
vineyards when I was out there it was

857
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:12,570
you know I mean like it was so much fun

858
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,158
especially to work with I'll bet the

859
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,690
entire time a guy just like he's been

860
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,010
working he's from the area he's been

861
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,648
working there for 20 years for this

862
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,639
company I don't know how he knew where

863
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:22,949
all the different vineyards were

864
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,710
everything was just this maze of dirt

865
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:28,348
roads and somehow he would know how to

866
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:31,588
get to all these different little under

867
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:32,730
1 hectare size plots all the time a part

868
00:34:31,588 --> 00:34:34,799
of it that was really interesting is

869
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,230
that we did really very little chemical

870
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,419
analysis of grapes to figure out when we

871
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,039
were harvest and

872
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:42,679
what kind of wine to make we are doing

873
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:45,190
everything by taste yeah so we would

874
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,119
just go around and eat grapes all day

875
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:51,798
which is actually really bad because

876
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:54,740
these are really really tannic and and

877
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:56,809
sugary grapes and I was thinking about

878
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,939
it too much like chewing on chewing on

879
00:34:56,809 --> 00:35:00,650
things too long and I destroyed my mouth

880
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,809
within a couple of days I had like all

881
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:04,099
chapped lips and like sores my tongue it

882
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,470
was really bad

883
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,690
fortunately I was able to like to get

884
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:10,818
faster with you know with how I would do

885
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,079
I go on with all the tasting but being

886
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:13,338
able to do that and taste from so many

887
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,548
different vineyards and talk to someone

888
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:19,190
who's an expert was maybe the most

889
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:21,288
important thing that took away from ya I

890
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,869
from working there it's a skill that you

891
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:26,480
like it's a really unique opportunity to

892
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:29,450
I especially be able to like to taste

893
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,519
from hundreds of vineyards to make all

894
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:35,268
these comparisons which was a lot of fun

895
00:35:31,518 --> 00:35:36,768
Borja is famous i recently whistle news

896
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:38,959
it became famous because it's the home

897
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:42,489
of the edge a home oh they board hum

898
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,409
which is that tiny oh wait sorry like so

899
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:46,639
yeah it's too many slides I get mixed up

900
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:50,210
in what's coming next but yeah so this

901
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,710
is a very large winery um so this is

902
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,759
like you have like machine harvested

903
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,220
grapes being dropped off to a

904
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:58,219
subterranean crusher that then push

905
00:35:55,219 --> 00:36:00,288
things to the large tanks yeah I could

906
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:02,778
really like large facility it would go

907
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:06,019
through you know thousands and thousands

908
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:07,730
of tons of grapes really impressive but

909
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:10,909
it also do small a lot fermentations as

910
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,650
well a big big range but it's home of

911
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:15,889
actually almost a bort I don't know if

912
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:18,230
you've seen any of this I so that's what

913
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:20,389
Bora is most famous for is this funky

914
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:23,358
painting that this woman was going to

915
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:25,368
restore and did a horrible job on it but

916
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,750
now it's more famous than ever it's

917
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:29,088
bringing in tours from all over the

918
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:31,068
world to take a look at this you know

919
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:34,000
get this painting so that's what looked

920
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:36,889
like before that's what looks like now

921
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,900
that's the restoration job but I would

922
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:42,230
argue that it is not the weirdest or

923
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:44,930
creepiest painting in born hump there is

924
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:46,190
this great cafeteria that I think I can

925
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:48,078
became friends with the owner and eat

926
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:51,309
there like have like my lunch and dinner

927
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,289
there every day and this is hanging up

928
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:56,409
in his restaurant so this is a painting

929
00:36:53,289 --> 00:37:01,929
it's an original from the 80s and that

930
00:36:56,409 --> 00:37:04,869
is the former king of Spain Carlos so

931
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:06,939
this I got like Spain here being upheld

932
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:10,869
by a bunch of hands and then you have

933
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:12,879
like a rather spelt bare-chested King

934
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:17,769
Charles wearing a gold necklace with his

935
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:21,278
arms crossed growing out of the land as

936
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:24,908
long as well as like a naked pair with a

937
00:37:21,278 --> 00:37:27,548
pregnant woman yeah look at that every

938
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,900
day like four or five weeks for lunch

939
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:32,429
and dinner I'd see that every day just

940
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:38,009
looking at it yeah what a yeah so

941
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:38,009
there's that that I'll never forget that

942
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:41,619
but this is what they like what I think

943
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:43,900
the area is should be more famous for

944
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:47,579
it's just these old vine like these old

945
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:51,009
old Grenache of mines a lot of them are

946
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:53,919
60 years plus and exist these gnarly old

947
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:55,869
looking vines but they produce some of

948
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:57,308
the most exquisite tasting wine that

949
00:37:55,869 --> 00:38:00,789
I've ever tried

950
00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:02,199
it's really something else yeah so that

951
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:04,449
was a lot of fun you could also have

952
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:06,309
these fiery red soils and I could like

953
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,688
just a big diversity and like and what'd

954
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:09,699
you find out there's a beautiful area as

955
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:11,259
well as you can see it does it wasn't it

956
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:13,150
wasn't a bad place to hang out for him

957
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:15,880
for a while yes we learned a lot there

958
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,588
and here's something to show you like so

959
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,499
go notch it's the most planted red

960
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:21,608
variety in like red grape variety like

961
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:24,248
from wine in the world

962
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:26,199
and so here's Tempranillo on either side

963
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:29,618
and this is garnet you can just see that

964
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:32,769
it is resilient it can take a beating it

965
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:34,989
crops heavy but it really liked it yeah

966
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:37,118
so this is lately in the season it's

967
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:39,999
always the last thing to come in just

968
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,919
because it you know it can really hang

969
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:44,348
on there like an under these under these

970
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:46,389
conditions you can see that Tempranillo

971
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:48,219
is starting to fall apart like that like

972
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:50,318
I could identify what variety of

973
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:53,289
vineyard was from hundreds of meters

974
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:55,389
away just because you can see like the

975
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:58,539
the condition that the canopy is in so

976
00:38:55,389 --> 00:39:01,400
so Grenada is really pretty beastly

977
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:03,380
heavy duty grape that can handle

978
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,880
a lot of different conditions but I

979
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,010
think it really needs these to produce

980
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,390
high high quality fruit I think that a

981
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:13,130
lot of people plant it in other areas

982
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:14,719
just because it can handle adversity but

983
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,369
a lot of times they crop it really

984
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,909
really heavy it doesn't really work out

985
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:22,069
that well yeah it's like that was a lot

986
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:24,529
of fun to learn about garnacha but after

987
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:26,570
that harvest was over there wasn't

988
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:29,420
really too much more to do but apples

989
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:31,039
were still in season so I went up to a

990
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,720
studious to learn about side of

991
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,300
production and as many of you know I'm

992
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,189
really interested in apples in cider and

993
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,260
so a studious is a really really

994
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:42,289
beautiful area so it's wedged between

995
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:45,110
the picos de europa so this is what the

996
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:46,670
mountains look like in the area really

997
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,110
we're there you'll see lying herds of

998
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,280
goat and sheep like goats and sheep

999
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,500
walking through there with shepherds

1000
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,630
they make a lot of cheese up there and

1001
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,579
bordered by the sea as well it's just

1002
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,070
like a really really stunning area but

1003
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:59,539
they have a strong tradition making

1004
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,030
cider just because grapes don't really

1005
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:03,529
grow on that area so it's really

1006
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,740
different than other varieties of cider

1007
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:08,180
that you may be aware of because it is

1008
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:09,109
more acidic now has to go to malolactic

1009
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:11,059
fermentation

1010
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,890
I'd like that is so acidic and it's not

1011
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:14,900
carbonated but to aerate it

1012
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:16,730
they port from up like remote like at

1013
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,340
all Heights oh this isn't it in a cedar

1014
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:21,079
area where they pour it from you know

1015
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,550
like the waiters hold it above their

1016
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:23,750
head and have these little splash guards

1017
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,039
because otherwise you'd make a mess

1018
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,809
everywhere there's someplace that I have

1019
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,300
drains in the floor where they just hose

1020
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:30,949
the place down every night the

1021
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,220
traditional way to do it is out of a

1022
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:35,869
tank I can so this is say Tsar he was

1023
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:37,129
really really nice showing me around the

1024
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:38,690
whole area and you can see the

1025
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:40,910
traditionally they were served out of

1026
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:43,099
out of tanks needed like all the mess

1027
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:47,569
that he's making them at the splashing

1028
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:49,190
around like so like I don't think that

1029
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,830
Spanish cider traditionally can be

1030
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:53,269
expanded just because it's it's it's

1031
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:54,769
it's own thing yeah can you supposed to

1032
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:57,170
just pour a little bit and then down it

1033
00:40:54,769 --> 00:41:00,320
in ya in a few gulps when it's still

1034
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:03,349
cloudy with all of the gas and

1035
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,700
carbonation from it but it's you know it

1036
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:07,039
was a lot of fun to learn about their

1037
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:08,500
their production practices I met with a

1038
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:11,570
couple of professors that study this

1039
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,099
most of the what much the orchards are

1040
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,870
really small in size because you have

1041
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:17,059
such diversity in

1042
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:18,529
in topography in the area then you'll

1043
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:21,500
have a lot of people that just manage

1044
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:24,980
these as a as a side business it's not

1045
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:26,570
their full-time job and so and because

1046
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,610
of that they don't they don't fruit then

1047
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,740
they don't spray anything they just grow

1048
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:33,289
apples harvest them and turn them into

1049
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:36,469
cider so it was really interesting to

1050
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:38,000
see I know different strategies for

1051
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:41,629
going is like in these minimal

1052
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,860
investment orchards in this area you can

1053
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,940
just say I'm then they just drop them

1054
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,140
off you'll have all these different

1055
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,210
varieties mixed together they don't

1056
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:49,129
really make blends they just excited

1057
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:51,289
with what shows up at the door I was

1058
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:54,170
really surprised to see just like them

1059
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:55,730
all thrown together like that yeah I can

1060
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,320
see yeah they're not the prettiest

1061
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,389
apples but they make great great great

1062
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,850
tasting cider traditionally they were

1063
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:05,019
made in these giant oak Baptists is

1064
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:07,190
Roberto like the owner of a large cidery

1065
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:09,259
yeah I can so like that's what they're

1066
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,579
traditionally made I made in nowaday is

1067
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,710
there it's more like white wine

1068
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:14,059
production a lot of the facilities look

1069
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,720
similar to a lot of wineries I've been

1070
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:19,549
to yeah I got to help empty how to press

1071
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:21,259
and some smaller like incidentally yeah

1072
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,930
this is like you know I couldn't a

1073
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:26,510
smaller side area I was able to check

1074
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:27,649
out there's all the funny and so they

1075
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,930
really diversified they're trying to

1076
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:32,150
like export egg and grow and grow the

1077
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:34,009
markets they're trying to diversify what

1078
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,380
they're producing so this is your

1079
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,360
traditional Australian cider they're

1080
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,519
also trying to make bottle conditioned

1081
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,980
like fermented ciders that are similar

1082
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:45,619
to a to a champagne selling apple cider

1083
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,929
vinegar or this is a still cider which

1084
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:50,269
is like with some juice added back to

1085
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:53,690
make it a little bit sweeter so they're

1086
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:56,239
trying to like to export more and and

1087
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,200
diversify what they're doing so it's

1088
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:00,139
interesting to see like how they're

1089
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,399
trying to move to move things their bio

1090
00:43:00,139 --> 00:43:03,139
state a couple other fun things I was a

1091
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,389
port though for a weekend with with

1092
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:07,250
Ignacio there's a lot of fun there I am

1093
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:11,359
at a port house with with Malay his wife

1094
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:13,670
I hiked 100 kilometres along the Camino

1095
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,750
de Santiago it's an old pickle an old

1096
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,639
pilgrim route I got a

1097
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:19,730
Compostela from the Catholic Church it

1098
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:24,199
took again to heaven free card so I got

1099
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:25,849
that going for me my parents came by I

1100
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:28,429
got to show them around just when to

1101
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:30,440
like to play tour guide there we are in

1102
00:43:28,429 --> 00:43:33,199
Sevilla so that was a lot of fun and

1103
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,630
then I went away oh and I probably ate

1104
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:38,778
about my bump my own bodyweight in home

1105
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:41,140
owned it is it's his own thing it yeah

1106
00:43:38,778 --> 00:43:45,260
you got a yeah yeah you got to try it

1107
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:47,960
it's its own food group it's fantastic

1108
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:50,569
but then in the final weeks of Nigeria I

1109
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,949
went down to Peru rapidly as when you

1110
00:43:50,568 --> 00:43:53,869
know I lived there for a while I went

1111
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:56,358
there for the wedding of my two good

1112
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:57,528
friends Nellie and Killian which was a

1113
00:43:56,358 --> 00:43:59,598
lot of fun I got to read at their

1114
00:43:57,528 --> 00:44:00,980
wedding which is I get a little nervous

1115
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,450
reading in Spanish in front of a couple

1116
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,010
hundred people but it worked out fine

1117
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:05,750
there's a lot of fun well I also was

1118
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,119
able to check out great production when

1119
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:10,250
I was down there which is really

1120
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:13,039
different than others you can just see

1121
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:14,750
how barren all this is and so they

1122
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:17,569
produce a lot of different varieties up

1123
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:20,150
here this is Octavio he runs like a

1124
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:21,949
pisco production area pisco it's a like

1125
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:26,119
a grappa lauren who so it's a distilled

1126
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:28,519
grape flicker and so he was growing

1127
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,190
grapes out here that were in bloom and

1128
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:33,108
he had LeBrock Alliance on the other

1129
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:36,318
side that were already in brace and

1130
00:44:33,108 --> 00:44:38,480
basically they control where the because

1131
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,558
isn't this like semi tropical

1132
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,329
environment where they could roll

1133
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:43,640
everything with irrigation and pruning

1134
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:45,260
they can get three harvests in two years

1135
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:47,480
off of their lebra Ska's but they try

1136
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:49,819
and just do one a year for their like

1137
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,440
for their brunette for us to make you

1138
00:44:49,818 --> 00:44:53,690
know you know I like to make peace go

1139
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,940
out of sow is really bizarre to see what

1140
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:58,278
like how they how they do this the area

1141
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,559
produces a lot of kochenia which are the

1142
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:03,559
little scale insects that the dye

1143
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,760
industry uses to make red dye I can so

1144
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:06,470
and this is the same area where they

1145
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,690
grow cactus they even have to irrigate

1146
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:14,088
cactus here like you can yeah like

1147
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:15,289
there's no water it is dry yeah I can

1148
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:17,838
then say yeah just gonna see like with

1149
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:21,289
us still epic stills that they used to

1150
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:23,630
make pisco are next and they also you

1151
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:26,750
know I can so I'm like two feet taller

1152
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:28,818
than everyone there yeah I was I got

1153
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:30,349
lost I like a bit of an oddity there

1154
00:45:28,818 --> 00:45:32,269
weren't too many Gringo's making it that

1155
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:35,900
far out into this area around arequipa

1156
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:37,719
to take a look at pisco production hours

1157
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,500
able to see like these are the old

1158
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:41,859
fermenting baths that they use some of

1159
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,630
these date back to the 1700s

1160
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,730
mostly more from the like the early to

1161
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:48,070
mid-1800s in here but like these are

1162
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:50,619
just what the old old technology that's

1163
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:53,769
still in use use areas to and like to

1164
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:56,680
ferment to ferment in and then these

1165
00:45:53,769 --> 00:45:58,929
piece goes this is like this that's what

1166
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:00,669
like an old press looks like and then

1167
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:03,250
this is like these are what like the

1168
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:04,389
clay vessels you know called piece ghost

1169
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:07,090
that were originally used to train

1170
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:08,739
ferment and then transport piece go in

1171
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:13,059
and this is an eco which is the primary

1172
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:17,439
great producing region in Peru which is

1173
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:19,119
its again like a desert that's like

1174
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,320
that's right outside of Iike I mean it

1175
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,390
has some of the tallest sand dunes in

1176
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,150
the world you get barren doesn't even

1177
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:27,699
start to describe it and then you just

1178
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,869
have like the slice of green that that

1179
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:30,000
goes through there where they irrigate

1180
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:32,320
everything some of the oldest

1181
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,409
agriculture in the Americas comes from

1182
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:38,619
coastal Peru in this area where they

1183
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:40,420
were irrigating like surprisingly they

1184
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:41,890
were irrigating cotton and not a food

1185
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:44,710
crop there you're getting cotton to make

1186
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:47,559
textiles and nets to go fish on like on

1187
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:49,269
the coast with but yeah so like really

1188
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:52,090
really old history of irrigation and

1189
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:54,400
agriculture in this area we're also the

1190
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:56,710
oldest vineyards in South America or in

1191
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,769
this area as well but that's where I

1192
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:00,909
finished up my travels from from I'd

1193
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:03,730
written it was able to come home right

1194
00:47:00,909 --> 00:47:05,440
before Christmas so I want to say thank

1195
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,579
you thank you thank you to the trio

1196
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,450
committee for letting me have this

1197
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:12,429
amazing experience being away also gave

1198
00:47:10,449 --> 00:47:13,839
me a lot of time to reflect and figure

1199
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,759
out what isn't what I do and I think

1200
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:18,309
that I wouldn't have wound up back here

1201
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,380
to work on my PhD if it weren't for that

1202
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:22,599
and I'm really excited about what's

1203
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,309
coming down the road so so thank you for

1204
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:27,159
that opportunity I learned so much in

1205
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:28,809
addition to that as well this is just

1206
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:31,210
the tip of the iceberg kind of give you

1207
00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:32,889
like the highlights of like of what

1208
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,449
happened when I was away but if you have

1209
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:36,809
any other questions I'd be more than

1210
00:47:34,449 --> 00:47:53,159
happy to

1211
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:55,349
for you Justine ain't here no no that we

1212
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:59,849
space them like they've just given a lot

1213
00:47:55,349 --> 00:48:02,670
more space between trees and again in

1214
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:06,509
this it's a dry area but it's not as dry

1215
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:08,970
as other parts I mean so in in epic on

1216
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:11,100
there's this enough water around its

1217
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:14,250
it's so pretty scrubby but they have oak

1218
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:15,539
forests in the area it's not like Toro I

1219
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:18,300
showed you with a three meter by 3

1220
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:20,730
meters facing south as guarantors - so

1221
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:23,610
there is some moisture there and they

1222
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:25,920
just I just like with grapevines where

1223
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:33,320
they space them out they have lower

1224
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:33,320
yields for her area yeah they were

1225
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:47,119
yeah well at the price point of almonds

1226
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:49,588
right now that making money off of it

1227
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,119
they're putting more in yeah we'll see

1228
00:48:49,588 --> 00:48:52,650
how long that lasts

1229
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,150
get weather like these trees will be

1230
00:48:52,650 --> 00:49:12,869
into production down the road but yeah

1231
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:16,259
it's working from that it depends on the

1232
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:16,829
denomination of origin but yes I know

1233
00:49:16,259 --> 00:49:20,239
that

1234
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:24,449
and in certain areas they do in in

1235
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:25,588
events with a sherry production and call

1236
00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:27,568
them you know grapes they really try and

1237
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:29,788
limit back just because there's a

1238
00:49:27,568 --> 00:49:32,099
tendency to try and crops up heavy maybe

1239
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:33,660
there and so they have one of the oldest

1240
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:35,940
denomination like that the oldest

1241
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:36,469
domination of origin in Spain is from

1242
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,989
Piraeus

1243
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:41,699
and they tankers pull up there yeah so

1244
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:45,630
there is no control in other areas

1245
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:50,099
you're not supposed to produce hybrid

1246
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:51,289
lines or lacrosse goes and any areas and

1247
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:53,350
a couple growing around

1248
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:55,909
rather than for personal consumption

1249
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:59,690
yeah so there's some control but it's

1250
00:49:55,909 --> 00:50:09,399
not as regulated as Franks it wasn't the

1251
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:12,400
other big impression that I got yeah

1252
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,400
yeah

1253
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,190
yeah while a lot of it comes down to

1254
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:22,800
clothes from our selection now a lot of

1255
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:24,599
these are Spanish grapes that they used

1256
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,390
that like that were developed in these

1257
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:30,330
areas that get extraordinarily hot they

1258
00:50:27,389 --> 00:50:32,309
also try and in the more vegetation

1259
00:50:30,329 --> 00:50:35,150
around the fruit zone because it's so

1260
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:37,380
dried they don't have to worry about

1261
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:39,180
disease pressure that you have to worry

1262
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:42,720
about it in other areas by having less

1263
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:44,669
airflow or less light penetration on the

1264
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:47,189
berries to by shaving them more with

1265
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:49,159
leaves you protect them more yeah you'll

1266
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:51,119
have to worry as much about honey about

1267
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:54,509
disease pressure so you can still get

1268
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:58,108
away with it and it gets up to 40 45

1269
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:59,760
degrees but that's not that's not the

1270
00:50:58,108 --> 00:51:02,338
entire season they'll have it in July

1271
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,530
and in August you know get these big

1272
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:06,599
temperatures but and other times of the

1273
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:07,920
year it'll be okay cool you also have

1274
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:11,760
these big diner no swings in temperature

1275
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:14,579
because you have a cure in such a dry

1276
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,690
climate as well so it may only reach

1277
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:17,690
that hot for a couple of hours

1278
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:29,630
any final questions thanks so much this
