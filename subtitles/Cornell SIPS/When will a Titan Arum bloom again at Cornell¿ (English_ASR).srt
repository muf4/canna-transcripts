1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:04,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:12,240
University okay well so we're getting to

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:16,000
the end of the Titan uh Titan exhibit

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,160
we've had a lot of fun uh and the uh

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,839
sibling corn uh to we stinky that we've

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,439
had on display all week is going to get

7
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:24,879
planted today uh I just found funny

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,240
enough I just found a label at the

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:30,759
bottom of this pot that guarantees that

10
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,558
this pot will not break for 10 years um

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,200
and I want to call the manufacturer and

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,599
find out if there's a warranty against

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,320
Titans or if that n nullifies the

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,239
warranty so all right so this is our uh

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,200
sibling corn we stinky uh this one

16
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:46,799
doesn't have a name yet because if you

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,520
didn't know already the tradition with

18
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,558
Titan Growers is so we don't actually

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,120
give it a pet name until it actually

20
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,358
blooms but we're very hopeful this is

21
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:56,679
going to bloom we've been telling people

22
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,719
that this this little bud in the middle

23
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:01,159
that's starting to swell we're fairly

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,679
certain is a flower bud so if all goes

25
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:05,798
well uh with a bit of luck uh we could

26
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,560
have a Titan and another Titan blooming

27
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,720
and and and my guess now is 4 to 6

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,280
months but uh you'll have to check back

29
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,400
on the blog because it's it's hard to

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,400
say at this stage and it weighs about 55

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,920
lbs so I'm going to try not to get a

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,920
workers comp

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:31,439
claim and I think this is just about

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,439
right so this is our day Mall

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,159
and remember we do name these we give

36
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:40,559
these pet names when they

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,920
bloom so now if you have any good names

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,000
write them down and we might uh do a

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,519
vote which is what we did when we name

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,319
we

41
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,920
stinky Titans tend not to be dormant for

42
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,718
very long and if they stay wet it

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,719
probably will be even less time

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,239
[Music]

45
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,679
flower that makes babies

46
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:12,079
cry okay so we have watered uh in our

47
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,239
sibling plant to we stinky uh and now

48
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,200
we're just going to have to wait and see

49
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,800
um probably everybody wants to know when

50
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,799
can I say for sure if this is a flower

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,640
uh and I really won't know uh until the

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,840
the the bud emerges from the soil which

53
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:30,159
I expect to take a couple months uh

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,680
and about a month after that once it's

55
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,359
about 30 in tall um we'll start to

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,599
notice a bulge in the middle and and

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,040
we're really hoping for that I think we

58
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:42,439
have a reasonable expectation so maybe

59
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,840
in 2 to 3 months check the blog and

60
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:47,560
we'll let you know where things are at

61
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,560
official people

62
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,599
come this has been a production of

63
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,759
Cornell University

64
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,759
