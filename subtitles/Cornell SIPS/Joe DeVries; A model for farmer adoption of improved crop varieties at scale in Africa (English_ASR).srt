1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,240
University thank you very much for that

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,878
overly generous introduction Margaret

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,039
and I wanted to say uh I'm super excited

5
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:22,800
to talk to you today uh I want to say

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:24,519
thank you first of all to Lou and Kelly

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,560
for organizing my schedule and making

8
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:28,320
the arrangements and everybody else who

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,038
puts on these seminars and makes it

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,960
possible to share ideas is with the rest

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:38,840
of the world

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:42,480
um I I really uh as I was saying am very

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:46,879
excited about this talk because I feel

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:48,839
like hunger in Africa malnutrition in uh

15
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,759
parts of Africa and the rest of the

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:57,039
world really is one of the most pressing

17
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:59,198
uh issues of our day and that makes it

18
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,160
important but what makes it more

19
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:04,079
exciting is that I believe we can now

20
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,798
solve these problems I look at the the

21
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,519
UN development goals number two is

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,200
ending hunger basically by 2030 we could

23
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,840
do

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,478
it uh and we could do it using maybe not

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,799
just exactly the kind of things I'm

26
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:21,039
talking about today but many of them and

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,960
uh and it's a shame that there's not

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,000
more money being put into them um the

29
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,158
battle is not won by a long shot and So

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,759
for anybody contemplating a career in

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,479
plant breeding

32
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,118
uh I'm not saying that you know you're

33
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:39,560
too late uh there there's there there's

34
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:42,359
there's a lot to be done still but we do

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,240
have some good Notions about how to end

36
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,959
Hunger in parts of the world that really

37
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,879
can't produce enough food at present

38
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:53,239
time so let's dive in but first I want

39
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:55,280
to acknowledge my co-authors isuk apran

40
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,560
and Irene Mogi who you see there on the

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,439
slides Irene Mogi is senior program

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,439
officer with seed systems group where I

43
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:06,319
live in Nairobi Kenya and Dr Isa fu

44
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,199
kapran is a sorum breeder and he leads

45
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,598
our program in West Africa we have a

46
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:14,839
regional office in

47
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:17,238
L so first slide start with some data

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,120
it's always good to do that by the way

49
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:23,360
this will be the least scientific uh

50
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,560
seminar given probably this decade here

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,160
at Cornel so bear with me but I I did

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,759
want to show some trends that I think

53
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:35,519
are pretty interesting and these show

54
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:39,079
the correlation between the supply of

55
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,000
improved seeds specifically ma seed in

56
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,719
Uganda and Kenya over a period of about

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,959
15 years and then looked at what

58
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,560
happened with maze yields in those

59
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,800
countries over the same amount of time

60
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,080
and I think you can see that the

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,719
correlation is not perfect but it's

62
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,440
pretty good

63
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:01,598
and uh anytime you can get data at a

64
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:05,280
national level in Africa which show a

65
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:07,639
trend you're in a a pretty fortunate

66
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,239
situation because data collection really

67
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:14,399
isn't that uh uh that good so when it

68
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,200
shows up on FAO uh data sites you know

69
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,560
you you feel like you've done

70
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:24,119
something um now I always use this slide

71
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,598
when I'm talking to uh agricultural

72
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,158
ministers and leaders in other countries

73
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:33,438
that we work in now because it for me

74
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:36,560
was a real point in time when I learned

75
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:38,919
that here in the United

76
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,840
States uh for a long time we struggled

77
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,919
with maze yields as well and if you

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,598
convert these yields I think this data

79
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:49,919
is gathered by Purdue University um from

80
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:52,560
1886 right up until the mid 1930s our

81
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,598
maze yields were stuck at about 1.5

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,199
metric tons per Hector and 1.5 metric

83
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,280
tons per hectar is a pretty good average

84
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,959
yield for Maze across the continent of

85
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,598
Africa wouldn't you say it yeah yeah um

86
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,400
and then what happened here in the US

87
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,719
was the introduction of hybrid Maze of

88
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,680
course originally double cross hybrids

89
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,719
and then single crosses and then

90
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,079
everything else that has come on

91
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:20,879
since so you know it's not like we never

92
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,400
had this problem we did for a long time

93
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,600
and it wasn't we like we weren't trying

94
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,120
to solve it we had developed the land

95
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,280
grant universities they were breeding

96
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
opv maze during these times there were

97
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,879
names to those varieties and we had

98
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,680
developed the extension service and

99
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:39,560
still we couldn't make yields bud until

100
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,000
the Advent of hybrid

101
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:47,918
maze so um why focus on seed systems um

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,600
again we we feel like we have proof of

103
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:55,038
concept now on uh the development of

104
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,560
seed system which is really what this

105
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:01,639
talk is

106
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:04,560
about um by the way the subt of the talk

107
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,439
is the 10 Things I wish I knew before I

108
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,038
became a plant breeder and we'll go

109
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:13,240
through those too and I hope um you find

110
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:18,360
those useful but uh what we did at at

111
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:22,918
the end of a f 15 years of work at Agra

112
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,319
was to measure rice and Maze yields in

113
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,599
10 countries where we had worked and

114
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,479
where we could vouch for you know the

115
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,439
attribution issues if anybody wanted to

116
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:34,439
call on it and then compareed those with

117
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:38,079
10 similar countries where we had never

118
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:41,879
worked on seed systems and you can see

119
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:45,120
the big difference in Trends in yields

120
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:47,560
of those crops over that period with um

121
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,840
up to at least 2020 those countries we

122
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,720
had assisted advancing quite quickly and

123
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,638
in the rest of Africa not much happening

124
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,840
so if you're in one of these countries

125
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:02,199
in the orange uh line there life is not

126
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,879
good as a farmer you know population is

127
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,919
growing Africa's population is still

128
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:08,038
growing at a steady clip in the

129
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:11,359
countries where we work it's about 2.8

130
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,199
up to 3% and some countries like ner are

131
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,000
over

132
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,280
5% so you know this is dwindling

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,759
resources this is subsistence

134
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:23,918
agriculture subsistence agriculture is

135
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,840
not sustainable this is an urgent

136
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,519
problem and if you look at other authors

137
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,439
just to cite another publication that

138
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:33,159
looks at yields on a big scale and you

139
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,120
know again if you're in my field you

140
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,319
look for small positive signs and that

141
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,000
is a very nice positive upward Trend

142
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,720
that had not happened for a long time in

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,319
many of the countries where we

144
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,759
worked so again addressing uh those

145
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,919
people who may be interested in a career

146
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,199
in plant breeding or International Plant

147
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,918
breeding and in International

148
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,919
Development in general I would

149
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:05,680
say uh reviewing what it took to be in a

150
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:08,359
position to put money toward this work

151
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,720
and do it in a practical way we come to

152
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,199
my first

153
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,440
lesson uh lesson number

154
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,439
one international agriculture

155
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:21,399
development is a fairly topheavy field

156
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:23,959
and that's being a bit um you know

157
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:27,198
politically correct I think if you read

158
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:30,038
me correct or well and farmers are often

159
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,439
the last to benefit um

160
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:37,038
there's a whole lot of money spent by

161
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:40,000
Rich countries on develop and the Big D

162
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:43,079
development absorbs a lot of

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,519
resources so you might expect that since

164
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:48,198
the biggest problem that we're working

165
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,639
on is farmer productivity at the basic

166
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,960
level that most of the money would be

167
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,639
going there but I'm using this graphic

168
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,399
and I don't have any data for this I

169
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,560
hope you know and this is offer authors

170
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:02,239
rant not for citation as you see at the

171
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,038
bottom there but you know the amount of

172
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,280
money that gets spent on Administration

173
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:09,399
and conferences and then big rural

174
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,598
development projects that honestly uh I

175
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:14,758
don't know where the money goes I do

176
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:17,199
know where the egg research money goes

177
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,520
and to be frank I think we're still

178
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,960
topheavy in terms of expenditure on

179
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,878
Research versus expenditure on delivery

180
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,560
at the farmer level I don't know why it

181
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,680
is a lot of donors some governments

182
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,360
don't really think that's a interesting

183
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,799
problem we happen to believe it's a it's

184
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,320
an interesting problem um the breeding

185
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,718
work I'll talk about a lot today that

186
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,519
money has done some good but we're still

187
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,278
fighting for enough resources down at

188
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,720
that bottom end of that funnel which is

189
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,399
where Farmers actually get to benefit

190
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,959
from what we're

191
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,080
doing I've just mentioned a lot of the

192
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,359
the breeding initiatives that I think

193
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,000
you know the donors have to be

194
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,000
recognized for African governments as

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,360
well uh simmit has done a great job with

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,200
stress tolerant maze some of you may be

197
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,560
aware of that work uh there are a lot of

198
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,800
uh rice varieties available now from

199
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,559
Africa rice and Erie uh a lot of the

200
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:17,519
national egg research institutes also

201
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,719
have uh a number of good varieties some

202
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,560
of them are willing to share so there's

203
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,200
exciting work that's been done in

204
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:28,399
breeding

205
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,839
and um and so it's it's there we we have

206
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,440
one breakthrough that we can really use

207
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,880
to deliver benefits to

208
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,720
Farmers but very few of those varieties

209
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,278
have reached have reached the farmers

210
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,160
they there there seems to be a cycle

211
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:44,360
wherein you know money gets poured into

212
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,319
research people can spend their whole

213
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,759
career and that's kind of a cautionary

214
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,920
tale for anybody I think studying plant

215
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:55,240
breeding today is that you need to be

216
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,240
careful because you could get into a

217
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,519
career in research thinking that you're

218
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,399
going to be able to help farmers and you

219
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,159
can get caught in that cycle of research

220
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,839
and never get involved with actually

221
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,679
helping farmers and you wouldn't want to

222
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:14,360
have that happen to you so lesson number

223
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:18,278
two uh it's a hungry World it really is

224
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,440
uh I'm probably more convicted of this

225
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:24,360
because we work in what we call the Left

226
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:30,120
Behind countries but I can tell

227
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:31,959
you I can assure you that uh there are

228
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,399
millions and tens of millions and

229
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:36,599
hundreds of millions of people yet in

230
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,440
Africa that have never had the

231
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,200
opportunity to grow a new variety or are

232
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,519
suffering from the effects of never

233
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,759
having been able to grow an improved

234
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,200
variety and again with population growth

235
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:52,000
and reducing Farm size that's becoming a

236
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,399
bigger problem every single

237
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,799
day so it's an a matter of urgence for

238
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,440
more people to become plant breeders if

239
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:03,519
you've chosen this field

240
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,360
congratulations um I I really feel like

241
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,399
there's there's there's so much you can

242
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,839
do to make the world a better place just

243
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,159
to cite a few examples what we've seen

244
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,399
in terms of breakthroughs over the past

245
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:19,919
couple of decades we have reliable

246
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,879
resistance to R ymv and bacterial blight

247
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,439
and I see Susan mcud in the audience I

248
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:28,159
won't go any further because I'll

249
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,040
embarrass myself but we have really uh

250
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,159
great rice Friday we don't have enough

251
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,199
you know I was just talking to some

252
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,360
graduate students and one of them comes

253
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,879
from a Highland region of India another

254
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,200
one comes from Nepal and I'm asking do

255
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,679
you have any

256
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,920
Highland uh cold tolerant rice varieties

257
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,078
that we could introduce into madag Gasco

258
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:51,120
so we still need more um you know

259
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,799
resistance to maze streak virus big

260
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,560
breakthrough in breeding of maze tum

261
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:59,399
Leaf light these were diseases that

262
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:02,278
killed maids in many countries made it

263
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,039
virtually impossible to grow maze

264
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,240
productively in Uganda for example and

265
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,078
large parts of Kenya

266
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,839
until group people I know and work with

267
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:17,159
and even little old me uh got busy and

268
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:20,360
bred a new generation of uh F uh hybrids

269
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:23,319
resistant to folar diseases I was in

270
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,240
Northern Togo last week and I'm afraid

271
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,480
there may be a new strain of ma streak

272
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,320
virus so yeah as borlock always said the

273
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,560
wolf is always at the door with these

274
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,278
diseases and we need to keep working on

275
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,479
them but there's been great resistance

276
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:40,439
to anthros grain moles big problem in

277
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,039
sorghum head buug resistance as well cop

278
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,720
Leaf brought in Rosette virus disease in

279
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,679
groundnut a big problem we have

280
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,240
resistant varieties now they haven't

281
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:53,799
reached Farmers uh acmv African casava

282
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,278
mosaic virus huge problem Brown streak

283
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:59,559
virus as well that out broke broke out

284
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:02,120
about 20 years ago in Northern MOS can

285
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:04,919
cause famine conditions in parts of mosm

286
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,039
Beque um we now have resistant varieties

287
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,719
to those thanks to some breeders I can

288
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:14,679
mention but yeah beans has been a big

289
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:19,079
success story uh the advancement of

290
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:21,879
folar disease resistance damping off uh

291
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:22,759
uh shoot maggot in beans has has been a

292
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,519
big

293
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:29,639
breakthrough um and uh Downey Miler

294
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:33,240
resistance and the development now of

295
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,039
hybrid Pearl Millet is super exciting I

296
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,120
don't think any farmer has gotten hybrid

297
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,399
Pearl Millet yet but we're going to work

298
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,278
on that we've got it in um test

299
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,519
production plots in Northern Ghana right

300
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:47,679
now and hopefully we'll start to get

301
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,440
some seed out starting next year um

302
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,838
resistance to striga in cpy and other

303
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,839
foler diseases so if you want to know

304
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,440
what this looks like on the ground

305
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,920
that's a land race of sorghum from uh

306
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,040
the sahelian region of Mali and to the

307
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:08,838
right uh an intermediate Guinea

308
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:11,078
uh hybrid of sorghum the farmers

309
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,079
said oh when they saw that you know they

310
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:15,359
said oh but you've made a big mistake

311
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:17,838
because we need the stock to feed our

312
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,720
animals we said well just try the star

313
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,959
and see how the animals like it and they

314
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,278
loved it because it's actually much more

315
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:26,719
digestible lower Lian contents in the

316
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:28,720
stem and it doesn't have to be so high

317
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,000
ligant because it's not as tall so that

318
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,639
was a in um as I said Bean varieties

319
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,480
that are extremely uh way better than

320
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,360
the local R that's a local Bean VAR in

321
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,600
Rwanda can you imagine if you're a

322
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,199
farmer growing that and you get a chance

323
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,600
to grow this one well yeah the breeder

324
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,319
did their job uh there's David ell in

325
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,440
the background standing there

326
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,920
proudly surveying his improved groundnut

327
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,800
variety here where this farmer is

328
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:01,639
standing and that's the farmer's variety

329
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:04,278
on the right so as you can see big big

330
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:08,000
differences again this is uh Bean in

331
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:10,439
southern Sudan we stole this one from uh

332
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,639
Uganda and brought it across the border

333
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,160
that's the local variety any breeder can

334
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,440
see the big differences that are

335
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:20,759
available lesson number three though is

336
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,720
it's a lot easier to develop a new

337
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:27,959
variety than it is to get the seed of

338
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:31,040
that variety to scale and I was a once a

339
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:34,799
neoy in this field after we had released

340
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:36,278
our first uh series of maze hybrids in

341
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,838
uh Western

342
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:43,919
Kenya I asked myself for the first

343
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:46,880
time what do we do now uh I think it's

344
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:49,559
time to get off the research station and

345
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,240
uh and Gary Tennison said he was my boss

346
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,399
at the Rockefeller Foundation he said no

347
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,799
problem J jump on a plane we'll go see

348
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,919
the guys at Pioneer and we went to

349
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,198
Pioneer you know we signed all those

350
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,360
non-disclosure forms and we got inside

351
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:04,359
the interner sanctum with the big shots

352
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,039
and I made a presentation like this to

353
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,600
them and I said so I think you guys need

354
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:09,078
to come into a big collaboration with

355
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,720
the Rockefeller

356
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:16,758
foundation and there was silence in the

357
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,920
room that became a bit of a distraction

358
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:20,039
until somebody said well I think we

359
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,360
should take a

360
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:27,559
bio and the guy met me in the hallway

361
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,919
and he said he said Joe nice

362
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:32,000
presentation great stuff you're doing

363
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:32,000
doing out there we're not

364
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,399
coming um yeah there's more to that

365
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,039
story than than that but that was the

366
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,480
that was the answer we got at that time

367
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,639
that was in about 2001 but on the way

368
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,800
home uh I had an idea which I'll tell

369
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,440
you

370
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,958
about

371
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,480
but nobody ever tells you when you're a

372
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,799
breed student that you might have to

373
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,159
look for your own funing maybe they tell

374
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,120
you though but did they talk to you

375
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:59,360
about variety release committees and how

376
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,078
political that can get

377
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,078
uh do they tell you about anything like

378
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:06,480
uh White labels which is under the plant

379
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,838
Health inspectorate uh did you ever

380
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,919
think about how to scale up from breeder

381
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:14,639
to Foundation seed and transition that

382
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,759
to certified seed growing um who's going

383
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,439
to train out Growers for the seed uh do

384
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,679
you even have a seed company interested

385
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,038
I'm always asking Cornell breeders so

386
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,160
what do you do after you release a new

387
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:28,519
variety say well we we license it to

388
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,600
seed companies you dope uh but you know

389
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:32,839
it's a it's it from where I come from

390
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,319
and Ed knows what I'm talking about it's

391
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:36,119
a legitimate question there may not be

392
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,639
any

393
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,719
seat um licensing agreements uh field

394
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,038
inspections again from plant Health

395
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,720
inspectorate uh who has the processing

396
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:48,400
equipment to produce clean seed and

397
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,480
who's going to do The Branding packaging

398
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,600
and get this out to Farmers those are

399
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,798
the issues that a breeder faces when

400
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:57,918
you're working in a developing country

401
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:00,839
system and so the real thing I came here

402
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,759
to say is is on this slide and I say

403
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:06,959
this to a lot of people and then I say

404
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,960
it only took us 30 years to figure this

405
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,480
out basically what you have is the

406
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,720
public private producer model for seed

407
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,120
systems development which needs to be

408
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,038
done I don't know where it doesn't need

409
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,918
to be done but we still need to put more

410
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:27,599
resources behind this either to increase

411
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:31,159
productivity of a few main crops that

412
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:33,038
are going to save lives or to diversify

413
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,039
uh seed supply systems so that people

414
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:38,240
can also diversify their

415
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:41,759
diets uh but it starts with public

416
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,919
reading and it shifts very quickly to

417
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,359
seed

418
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,759
companies and the interaction between

419
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,678
seed companies who are looking for a

420
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,919
profit by selling producing and selling

421
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,519
seed to small holder farmers and the

422
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,880
scientists there's magic there I don't

423
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,558
need to explain it but then that all

424
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,840
happens in isol

425
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:02,839
and the farmers don't even know you're

426
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,240
doing any of this and that's a big

427
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:08,279
problem because the African landscape

428
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,440
for agriculture is endless and they're

429
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,720
out there and they don't know and so we

430
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,640
needed a methodology for raising farmer

431
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,919
awareness and we have one now it's

432
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,159
called a village based advisor which is

433
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,280
kind of like a volunteer Health worker

434
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,880
and small pths don't do demos don't do

435
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,599
big demos at least don't put a lot of

436
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,840
money into them because you know the

437
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:31,599
farmers will stand there politely and

438
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:33,879
they'll say thank you can I get my Coke

439
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:38,199
now uh and then they'll go home and they

440
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,120
won't adopt it's sad you know because we

441
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,558
did that for a long time we don't do

442
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:44,519
that anymore the element of doubt that

443
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,879
was an agronomist who planted that field

444
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:48,599
my soil is poor I live a long ways from

445
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,159
here that briy is not going to work on

446
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,279
my farm it's not because they're not

447
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:53,240
interested it's because of the doubt and

448
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,798
the

449
00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:00,159
risk a small piece of land grown with a

450
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:03,599
tiny amount of seed that's 50 g that's

451
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:06,159
50 gram of a maze streak virus resistant

452
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,359
hybrid variety do you see the quality of

453
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,000
maze crop this woman has been

454
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:12,678
growing that's her that's the farmer

455
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,798
that's her maze

456
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,759
prop it's a

457
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:21,639
no-brainer and then distribution through

458
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:25,200
these mom and pop shops small just you

459
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:28,000
know a couple meters square of of real

460
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,519
estate where farmers can go and get

461
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,960
their seeds

462
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,359
number four if you're thinking this is

463
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,400
too daunting I don't want to be a plant

464
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,839
breeder anymore or I think I'll go into

465
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,759
biotech and study I don't know something

466
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:46,038
really you know esoteric um you're in

467
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:48,879
luck because farmers will pull you

468
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:51,720
through and they do make this system

469
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,000
work if they get half of a chance how

470
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,640
does it work this woman grew a small

471
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,079
pack of maze on her farm and you can see

472
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,600
she's not a young farmer that's her land

473
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,399
raise of Maze and this is in the

474
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,119
Southern Highlands of Tanzania and do

475
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,840
you see the size of that year what you

476
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:13,158
don't see is that it's about 14 feet

477
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:16,879
tall and that's a cimm

478
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:19,120
hybrid it's got a number and I asked her

479
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,240
after we visited her plot I said well

480
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,558
what are you going to do now you know

481
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,120
this seed is that's not free that's a

482
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:28,079
small pack you know it's just a demo um

483
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,798
you said oh no problem I'll sell a goat

484
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,319
I'll sell some chickens and then I

485
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,798
thought

486
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,960
well how is she going to know the name

487
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,798
of the hybrid when she goes to buy it

488
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,400
and then she took me by the hand and she

489
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:46,278
led me to her Hut and she said that's

490
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:51,360
the name of the hybrid

491
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:54,880
Tesh T I can't read the 5 538 yeah it

492
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,879
got released it's available

493
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,159
now uh when I was first sent out uh by

494
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,678
Rockefeller Foundation the real agenda

495
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,679
was to develop

496
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,038
biotech after a couple years I realized

497
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:12,400
the real revolution in agriculture for

498
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:15,480
the next 20 plus years was not going to

499
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,038
be in biotech I'm not dissing biotech we

500
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,720
we need it we need we need GM ma

501
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:21,000
yesterday in in Africa that's a

502
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,679
political

503
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,119
question but I could see that the

504
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,120
Revolution was really

505
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:32,519
here farmer participatory bre reading

506
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:34,959
can you believe that for decades before

507
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,798
this became

508
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,240
the state of the art for developing new

509
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:42,440
varieties breeders weren't asking

510
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,679
Farmers their opinion now what you see

511
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,798
here

512
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,798
is is amazing input from these brilliant

513
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:52,200
Bean farmers in eastern Congo and that's

514
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:54,158
the bean breeder and she's taking note

515
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,080
of everything they say about the new

516
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,039
varieties and you can use gender based

517
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:02,119
selection methods now

518
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,079
um this is under a farmers's field and

519
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:05,798
it really greatly reduces the likelihood

520
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,038
of missing the Target in terms of the

521
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:08,038
new

522
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,720
varieties the fifth lesson is you know I

523
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,480
again nobody nobody told me that I

524
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,038
needed to work on my people's

525
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:24,720
skills uh I was trying to become a plant

526
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:27,240
person and yet and I am not a a natural

527
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:31,679
born manager by any means I'm still

528
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:34,679
learning but but I saw some

529
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,679
incredi

530
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,200
Adept people managers and nurturers and

531
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:45,278
when I went to Africa who also happened

532
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,919
to be plant breeders and I took a note

533
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,599
uh from how they operated and realized

534
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,159
you know they would never be successful

535
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,678
at all if they didn't know how to work

536
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,840
with teams and I think this is a

537
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,720
universal rule for plant breeders if

538
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,959
you're going to become a plant breeder

539
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,120
at any level

540
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,480
you really need to be a good people

541
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,918
manager as well go take a course that's

542
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,798
what I eventually

543
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,400
did they'll teach you everything you

544
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,639
need to know but here's some of the

545
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,440
teams that we work with today this is

546
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,759
sier Leone that's

547
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,360
Madagascar Monica Parker famous uh

548
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,519
potato scientist anybody know her this

549
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:26,359
is Northern uh

550
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:28,918
Togo as John mcrobert in a field in uh

551
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:32,319
in uh in Bundi

552
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,600
that's my colleague Isa Fu in guine BAU

553
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:37,158
laying out some plots and this is the

554
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:40,519
other team from Southern

555
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:44,159
Togo lesson number six extremely

556
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:47,480
important lesson I want to say somehow

557
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,600
I'm a socialist at heart that's the way

558
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,038
I was

559
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:55,519
born and that's the way I will

560
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:58,960
die uh but I was born at the wrong

561
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:02,879
time uh to be a practicing

562
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:06,038
socialist and so I want to say almost

563
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,080
any breeder uh if you don't want to work

564
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:11,200
with private sector forget ever

565
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:14,000
achieving anything at any kind of scale

566
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,240
because you need seed companies they

567
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,398
need you but you need them just as much

568
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:23,880
and on that trip back from United States

569
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:27,158
when we' got shut down uh

570
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,960
by Pioneer did I mention the name of

571
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,480
the they they no longer exist so the

572
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,759
cortiva guys are great and they're

573
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:38,079
moving ah but the DuPont uh Pioneer

574
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,240
marriage was a Rocky one I think at that

575
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,839
stage and that's probably what

576
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:46,120
influenced but as I was steaming there

577
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:48,319
in my plain uh seat I looked out the

578
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:50,558
window and I asked myself you know was

579
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:53,879
there anything that we saw there in

580
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:57,558
Johnston that looked all that

581
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,840
complicated that an African Pioneer uh

582
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:01,000
entrepreneur

583
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:03,199
couldn't do I mean basically what I saw

584
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,359
them doing was growing crops and putting

585
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,720
them in Sea in packages and selling them

586
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:10,599
to Farmers and that really made all the

587
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,440
difference because I came back and I

588
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:15,918
said you know what we don't need Pioneer

589
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,960
we need African entrepreneurs to create

590
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,720
their own

591
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,240
pioneers and Ed came on the scene at

592
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,200
that point with just about this same

593
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,359
modus operandi and started to train some

594
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,399
of these pioneering seed comp companies

595
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:35,479
and you just they're they're an amazing

596
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:37,719
Innovation you can't imagine what this

597
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,159
kind of an institution this is green

598
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,440
Horizon seed company with a CEO in Juba

599
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:45,960
South

600
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,080
Sudan because unlike MC multinationals

601
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,798
these guys will send sell any seed

602
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:53,119
Farmers need the multinationals are just

603
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,558
in it for the hybrid Maze and eventually

604
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,479
BT cotton

605
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,359
probably uh but right now it's just

606
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,200
hybrid maze

607
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,519
and women tend to be really good at

608
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,880
running these seed companies go

609
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:10,398
figure and we see many of them

610
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,200
succeeding uh Against All Odds so just

611
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:16,239
to name a few maslaha Seed Company in

612
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,840
Nigeria these are not shade tree seed

613
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,960
companies these are industrial

614
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,439
vertically integrated seed companies

615
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:27,000
producing all these different crops of

616
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:30,519
seed and improved varieties uh Tonio in

617
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,079
equator seeds Northern in Uganda same

618
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:36,119
story uh

619
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:38,639
Felix uh of peacock seeds is also a

620
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:41,759
parliamentarian sometimes helps to get

621
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,600
seed policies passed but he's a seedsman

622
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,759
and that's his uh seed company producing

623
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:51,678
uh hybrid maze seed and a couple other

624
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:53,798
crops fok Caba that's myuna kibali she

625
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:58,720
won the Africa food prize for her work

626
00:27:53,798 --> 00:28:01,639
as uh leader of of fok Caba Seed Company

627
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,440
and she's she's tired now you know she

628
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,080
created a seed company it's successful

629
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,320
it's got it running she handed it over

630
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:09,439
to her daughter so there's

631
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:12,079
sustainability in this model as well and

632
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,320
eventually thanks to the generosity of

633
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:17,079
many people uh The Gates Foundation the

634
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:20,240
rockfeller foundation where I work we

635
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:24,359
went on to create about well many many

636
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,599
more than 114 seed companies and uh we

637
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:28,719
are still creating seed companies in

638
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:30,678
Africa and uh

639
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,319
and and we need to keep going as fast as

640
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:39,159
we can uh so lesson number

641
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:41,558
seven uh is this face-to-face extension

642
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:45,360
still matters and the uh with a nod to

643
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:47,158
John Prime um also known as your new

644
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,918
mobile phone app won't get you into

645
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,840
heaven

646
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:54,559
anymore uh I've seen so many of these

647
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:58,199
apps and I know they're well intended

648
00:28:54,558 --> 00:29:01,158
Farmers need proof of concept there's a

649
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,080
a accountability issue here it can't be

650
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:09,039
boiled down to a 4 in phone

651
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:13,158
screen uh and so that's where our friend

652
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,679
uh Paul seaward uh came through for us

653
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:16,960
because he was trying to get farmers who

654
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:18,840
had never used fertilizer to use

655
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,120
fertilizer and fertilizer is only sold

656
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:23,918
in 50 kg bags at some point he decided

657
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:24,959
you know I think the problem is the size

658
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,278
of the

659
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,159
bag and so he made one Kow bags of of

660
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:32,558
fertilizer and immediately sold all all

661
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:34,799
the stock that they had that was in

662
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,918
Western Kenya where Farm size is very

663
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,639
small and farmers are very poor and that

664
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:41,159
was pre- introduction of hybrid maze so

665
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,919
farmers were really poor and really

666
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:45,960
hungry and couldn't afford anything any

667
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,399
kind of Technology now go to Western

668
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,360
Kenya and it's like it's it's a True

669
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:53,719
Green Revolution scene but the idea here

670
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,479
is that as I've already said let the

671
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,278
farmer try don't make them take your

672
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,960
word for it let them go home and take

673
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:03,798
some of the seed with them and instead

674
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:07,798
of a few demos we get hundreds of

675
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:09,558
thousands of demos uh this drives demand

676
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:11,960
for improved seeds so that the seed

677
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,879
companies can stay in business and

678
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,278
Achieve what they came to

679
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,559
do aggro dealers uh really can't say

680
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:20,398
enough of them they didn't really fit

681
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,480
into one of the lessons but I think

682
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,918
they're kind of a no-brainer you don't

683
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,079
buy your your toothpaste from the

684
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,360
toothpaste company and Farmers don't get

685
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:33,918
their seed from seed companies you've

686
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:36,079
got to have distribution at scale and I

687
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,600
asked somebody recently how many aggro

688
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:42,119
dealers you suppose there are in Kenya

689
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:44,359
uh I had been hearing 3,000 and he said

690
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:48,199
no the latest data show there's probably

691
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:50,558
around 10,000 10,000 aggro dealers uh

692
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,519
selling seed and other inputs in Kenya

693
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,519
you know how many there are in

694
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,799
Togo about

695
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:00,638
six and they're all in the big cities

696
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:04,200
right so farmers don't have access to

697
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:07,719
seat that's a big problem uh but we're

698
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,679
training uh aggro dealers today well

699
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,919
last week that's why I was in Togo we're

700
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,200
we're training aggro dealers to become

701
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:18,639
small scale vendors of improved seed and

702
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,159
today right today we're doing the same

703
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:24,959
thing in bukavu in eastern

704
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,080
Congo lesson number eight you know the

705
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,240
best seed systems are not private sector

706
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:33,480
driven I don't think we have the best

707
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,200
seed system here in America I absolutely

708
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,519
believe in the public involvement the

709
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,519
Vitality of the public sector in a seed

710
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,278
supply system and that means I believe

711
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,120
in it for the whole food system and the

712
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,240
whole agricultureal system for first

713
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:51,918
stop Agriculture and then the whole food

714
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,880
system because just take the example of

715
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,799
you know the narrowing of our diets uh

716
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,399
when you just leave the decision making

717
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:01,798
up to the seed companies and the big

718
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:03,038
ones especially they're only going to

719
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:06,398
produce those crops that their

720
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:09,240
shareholders want to see them produce

721
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:12,599
and there's no private Seed Company ever

722
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,880
going to breed a new variety of bombara

723
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:17,959
groundnut uh and it's a really important

724
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,278
crop in Africa so I'm just showing a few

725
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,240
photos here this is in aritra and those

726
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:23,839
are the wheat

727
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,359
breeders uh who've got who've done a

728
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:30,798
fantastic job uh here this is a private

729
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,879
seed grower in Burundi producing in

730
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:35,558
collaboration with the public breeder

731
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,120
from isabu and that's the first hybrid

732
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:40,359
maze seed production plot ever in

733
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:41,398
Burundi that photo was taken just two

734
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:45,278
weeks

735
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:48,839
ago so as a result of the work we've

736
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:50,759
been doing over the past 25 years or so

737
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:53,519
there has been a lot of progress and

738
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:56,319
it's more than you can see in the data

739
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,558
on the ground we see big changes in

740
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:00,359
Farmer productivity in in these

741
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,720
countries and that's quite a number of

742
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:05,398
countries so you know it's it's it's

743
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,038
been exciting but we need to turn the

744
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:11,158
page because there's kind of

745
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:14,240
the you know mirror image or CIS image

746
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:16,760
of that uh map now on the other side of

747
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,120
Africa and that's composed of 21

748
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:22,558
countries where there really are no uh

749
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:25,398
progress has been no progress and that's

750
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:29,200
about 370 million people almost half the

751
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:30,599
land mass of Africa and to .8% annual

752
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,960
population growth that means it's

753
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:39,000
doubling every I think 20 23 years or so

754
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,880
um probably around 40 million uh Farm

755
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,119
families don't have access to better

756
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,799
technology extremely high rates of

757
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:51,199
absolute poverty and uh around 30 38%

758
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,519
average child malnutrition stunting and

759
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,639
that's chronic

760
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:58,038
malnutrition so the lesson number nine I

761
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:59,879
had a great conversation with The

762
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:02,158
Graduate students and ask them all

763
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,679
what's your minor because one of the

764
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,919
best things about Cornell is they make

765
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,280
you take the

766
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:10,200
minor and I want

767
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:12,800
to take up an issue because they were I

768
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:15,078
learned today in the discussion with the

769
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,000
students that if you had a master's

770
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,200
degree you only have to take one

771
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,358
minor so why did you guys make me take

772
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,358
two

773
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,759
minors anyway the point is there and I

774
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,398
and I benefited from both my mins

775
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,159
tropical soils and a eon by the way um

776
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,000
but it helps you to be able to reason

777
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,800
better I think when you go and meet with

778
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,918
leaders who are unconvinced about the

779
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,240
importance of this technology in their

780
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,559
countries read outside your Fields is

781
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:49,759
the is the main lesson I think I learned

782
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:52,639
here and um and be able to make this

783
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:58,160
case when the time comes and the time

784
00:34:52,639 --> 00:35:00,680
did come because uh in 20 2019 Cor

785
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,960
and Seed systems group and a and a

786
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:05,319
couple of brilliant guys from an A

787
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,320
consultancy called sat Guru came

788
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,160
together and we fann out across Africa

789
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,079
and we studied the seed systems in all

790
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:14,799
these countries and we put together a

791
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:18,039
business plan and it's only costs $95

792
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,039
million over five years so if anybody

793
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:22,400
need knows any billionaires roaming

794
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:23,679
around the streets of itha I'm here

795
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,440
until

796
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:29,118
Friday and uh I've got a business plan I

797
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,838
want to talk to them about

798
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:35,440
there's some of the outputs our our our

799
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:37,679
uh our report card if you will uh every

800
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,280
every nonprofit has to give their impact

801
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:43,440
or their report card and that's ours so

802
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,000
far you know we've reached uh all right

803
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,240
around 7 thou these these these data are

804
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,480
a little bit old I think we're about

805
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:54,919
750,000 Farmers reached so far in those

806
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,400
countries and uh produced about uh well

807
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,358
by the end of this year it will be well

808
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,440
over 5,000 metric tons of seed and what

809
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,078
we're also very proud of is the training

810
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,358
we do a lot of training some of it

811
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,560
degree based most of it short courses on

812
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:11,358
everything from breeding uh to seed

813
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:13,400
production to running an aggro dealer

814
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:15,078
shop yeah I just want to show some

815
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,559
images of what this work looks like on

816
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:19,640
the ground and then I'll wrap up but

817
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:23,159
that's the work in Burundi a very

818
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:27,118
important producer of beans an extremely

819
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:29,639
impoverished country uh with Farms very

820
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,960
small Farm sizes becoming hungrier by

821
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:35,719
the day average child malnutrition over

822
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,480
50% it's one of the highest in the world

823
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:39,879
and it's a green country there's no

824
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:43,719
reason they can't double the yields of

825
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:48,160
all those crops and and malnutrition in

826
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:49,679
Brun uh jibuti strange country um you

827
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:54,000
know

828
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:55,919
uh very Aid no rainfed agriculture but

829
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,920
they do grow forages and a bit of

830
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,960
vegetables and and we're in there thanks

831
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:05,960
to some funding from ea uh Dr

832
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:08,480
Congo very exciting country to work in

833
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:12,039
uh we're in on U hybrid maze seed

834
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,960
production and uh biofortified Bean uh

835
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:16,559
seed

836
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:21,000
production and uh Eritrea Wheats the big

837
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:23,719
crop there te as well and uh we D the

838
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,400
government had been importing about uh

839
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:29,719
three containers per year of hybrid maze

840
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,639
seed at great cost and you know arria is

841
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:34,239
a bit of a Hermit Kingdom they don't

842
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:36,199
have much Forex to go around and so they

843
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:39,159
said you can teach us how to produce

844
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:40,719
hybrid Maze We Said Yes we can and so

845
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:44,960
now they're producing hybrid maze in

846
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:47,519
nraa as well and reducing their Forex

847
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,760
expenditures um

848
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,000
Madagascar can't say enough about how

849
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:56,640
important the work is there extremely

850
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,318
impoverished country also 45 50% child

851
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:02,559
malnutrition

852
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:04,759
about 80% absolute poverty um and we

853
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,400
need to work on all fronts in Madagascar

854
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,880
very hard to raise money for that

855
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,680
country and uh lesson number 10 is

856
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,760
probably a little bit unexpected but I

857
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,559
just wanted to point out as breeders we

858
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,359
have to realize sometimes the local

859
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,199
varieties are better and that is the

860
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:21,679
case in in Somalia we're working on

861
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,838
sorghum there and I really have serious

862
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,759
doubts we're going to find anything

863
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:27,719
better than the local variety I think

864
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:30,200
that's true for certain varieties of low

865
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:31,719
non- irrigated rice around Africa

866
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:34,199
sometimes the local variety wins and

867
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:36,159
that's okay you know but do we stop

868
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:39,719
there no we can also introduce other

869
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:42,519
crops and so yeah we continue to work in

870
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:46,639
Somalia on uh on other fronts South

871
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:49,039
Sudan already mentioned Sagal Togo thank

872
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:49,039
you very

873
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:57,719
much for this wonderful talk I'm

874
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,199
wondering where uh for improved ities

875
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:02,519
are coming from are your leaders working

876
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:04,960
at public or government funed or these

877
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:08,759
coming from CGS where are you doing this

878
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,480
and is there an effort make a big consum

879
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,480
or Club

880
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,679
thats it's a great idea that last one

881
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,440
you know if I was a little

882
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:22,799
younger I would tackle that you know

883
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,880
just get these African governments CH uh

884
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,240
sharing varieties is hugely powerful and

885
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,960
they don't realize um that they that

886
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:31,879
they should be doing it but yeah a lot

887
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,920
of them come from the CG a lot of them

888
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,800
come from leading Nars I can mention a

889
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,800
few Molly has extremely talented

890
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,039
breeders Uganda there's Natural Born

891
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:47,720
breeders uh

892
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:50,920
Tanzania um yeah so we move around

893
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,679
we uh we work with those breeders who

894
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,599
have good materials and are willing to

895
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:55,279
share which is not always the case with

896
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,280
the

897
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,680
CG I don't want to get into that

898
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,800
so you got to have a plan B yeah that's

899
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:06,078
a big scramble you know how do where are

900
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,640
we going to get that that new rice

901
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:12,400
variety for you know Togo yes uh I just

902
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:14,199
want to ask what is something You'

903
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,760
worked on that's been really frustrating

904
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:18,759
or challenging and also what's a project

905
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,640
that you've done or are doing that

906
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,880
you're really excited

907
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:24,920
about okay that's a great couple of

908
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,838
great questions I would

909
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:31,880
say sorghum really kind of beats me you

910
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:33,960
know it's a wonderful crop and I wish it

911
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,480
was easier to convince Farmers to take

912
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,358
an improve variety but there's just

913
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,960
something about that Exquisite

914
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:42,039
adaptation it's had the time to develop

915
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,639
in certain

916
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:47,199
ecologies and you can show farmers

917
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:50,639
everything and they just they

918
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,679
just not going there the other question

919
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:54,519
where I'm most excited about working

920
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:58,039
right

921
00:40:54,519 --> 00:41:00,239
now I would say guinea B

922
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:03,440
you know because it's just one of those

923
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:05,358
classically forgotten countes and it

924
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,480
rains in Guinea BAU and the soils are

925
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:13,318
fine and child malnutrition is is is

926
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:16,559
extremely high so they haven't done any

927
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:18,079
variety testing since

928
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,599
1995

929
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,800
right we can we can bring in varieties

930
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:24,039
and we can get them into production so

931
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,560
yeah it's very exciting we're being

932
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:28,519
funded there uh by the world food

933
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:31,519
program

934
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,519
yeah

935
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:41,400
yes I want to know how would you

936
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:45,000
describe African government's support

937
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,000
towards do you find

938
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:54,279
your it's so it's so schizophrenic

939
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:57,759
that's not the right term but it's it's

940
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,880
just Case by case you know uh we work in

941
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,160
countries where I'm worried right now

942
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,920
where I'm standing whether we're going

943
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:07,000
to deliver they are so on it and so in

944
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,400
partnership with it we work in some

945
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
countries where they're like go yeah

946
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,599
whatever you know have fun you know we

947
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,400
don't know why you're here and that's

948
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:21,280
frustrating uh so it's just kind of

949
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:24,920
everything in between you um generally

950
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,079
speaking I would say if you can

951
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,159
communicate well to the people on Top

952
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,839
This is the importance of a

953
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,519
participatory Society in a

954
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:36,039
non-participatory

955
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:38,679
society sometimes it's only really one

956
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:41,199
guy or a person taking all the decisions

957
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:44,480
and if you can't get to them you're not

958
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:47,838
going to get far but if you

959
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,480
can uh yeah then you know I don't I

960
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:53,960
think we're living in a day and age when

961
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:57,480
nobody gets to go out public and and say

962
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:59,760
don't give my people new seed you know I

963
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,599
think that that would not work even in

964
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,640
some of these totalitarian governments

965
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:08,480
or countries and so that's what makes it

966
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:11,279
the right time I think to get in and

967
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,679
actually do this work thank

968
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,440
you a formal informal flow of that

969
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:19,279
farmers look like if you sent variety A

970
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,960
and B upet about both of them people you

971
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,960
know variety a ends up being

972
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,280
sold and ab fails how do you figure out

973
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,318
yeah

974
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:35,599
um it's messy uh it often passes through

975
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:38,199
aggro dealers or or the village based

976
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,359
advisors to the seed companies but

977
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:42,279
there's nobody in charge of that

978
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:44,239
communication you know I've got a team

979
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,920
we're about 30 people there's I I don't

980
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:50,439
have somebody who's in charge of that

981
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:54,480
and and so what you need is a volume of

982
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:56,720
of transaction you know enough people to

983
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,119
involved in the transaction so that at

984
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:01,078
least one of them is going to say hey

985
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,760
your variety

986
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:05,599
sucks

987
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,760
and and the seed company hears it you

988
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,519
know or the Breeders hear it you know so

989
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,480
that's that's the way I would say you

990
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:12,679
need that's why we try to work at scale

991
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,358
because if you don't have a certain

992
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:17,440
scale then that that critical

993
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:23,639
communication just gets gets stifled you

994
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,639
know yes you raing

995
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,119
awareness yeah well what I can tell you

996
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,519
is what they are not is probably easier

997
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:35,000
they are not leader farmers and we run

998
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:37,719
into that kind of language everywhere

999
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,639
and a leader farmer tends to be the guy

1000
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:44,358
with a car you know he's up there in the

1001
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:47,279
church uh tends to be

1002
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:50,239
male and you know just kind of kind of

1003
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,880
kind of the big guy uh and that's

1004
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:58,159
absolutely death for promoting you know

1005
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:00,680
new uh kind of controversial technology

1006
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,399
because nobody listens to them they've

1007
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:04,598
always had all the advantages and they

1008
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,200
associate you and your technology with

1009
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:09,838
the elite sector of society so we go to

1010
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:13,838
a lot of

1011
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:16,759
pains along with Paul Seward's team the

1012
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:18,960
farm input promotions group and here I

1013
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:21,079
have to give a major shout out that is

1014
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,838
not our intellectual property they

1015
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:26,280
invented that Lock Stock and Barrel we

1016
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:30,558
actually have a non-disclosure agreement

1017
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:33,280
with that so um we're we're obliged to

1018
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:36,359
to work in partnership with fips fips is

1019
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,800
like literally uh you know a sister

1020
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:42,400
organization to us and they figured out

1021
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:46,359
that Mo that model who the BBA

1022
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,480
is is someone who loves Agriculture and

1023
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:50,519
is a good

1024
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:53,800
communicate those of if I could sum it

1025
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:56,199
boil it down to two characteristics you

1026
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:59,559
know that we're looking for is somebody

1027
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:01,558
who really loves Agriculture and so and

1028
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:04,240
then and would would care enough to go

1029
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:08,040
around and talk to Farmers about

1030
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:09,879
it so one question onine I think

1031
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:12,960
indirectly answered it but it was how

1032
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:17,559
many people are employed

1033
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:22,358
by you know a full-time staff uh in our

1034
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:26,599
two offices about 30 but we work we

1035
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:29,159
through uh local National coordinators

1036
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:31,160
quite quite a bit and so you can not

1037
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:35,318
double the number but at least add

1038
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:37,078
another 15 or so people and uh they do

1039
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:39,838
the day-to-day management of our work on

1040
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,680
the ground they're part-time and some of

1041
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:44,318
them are are are breeders working for

1042
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:46,159
the Nars who get an agreement from their

1043
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:49,079
Institute to work with seed systems

1044
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:51,719
group and so they're on our business

1045
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:54,240
yeah we don't want to become big we're

1046
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:57,000
not we we're we're fighting to stay

1047
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:59,439
small Susan

1048
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,440
it seems

1049
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:08,720
like

1050
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:11,598
of so they get to know each other

1051
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:14,439
across that part of the go that that

1052
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:17,440
because I would think that local nwork

1053
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,440
very powerful

1054
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:25,680
terms Bas

1055
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:27,639
butross yeah yeah you know it's it's

1056
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:29,519
expensive uh

1057
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:31,920
and we we have an obligation to train

1058
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,199
the people who are doing the work you

1059
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,720
know so that they understand what

1060
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:38,799
they're doing we often neglect to inv

1061
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:44,279
invite important people that's probably

1062
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,280
you know partly my fault um

1063
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,559
but uh we're going to do that in

1064
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,639
November we're actually going to bring

1065
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:53,720
all of our practitioners together in um

1066
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:56,000
in Nairobi in November and have one of

1067
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:57,480
those kind of sessions where we actually

1068
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,358
have a few important people in the room

1069
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,440
and they can talk to each

1070
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,719
other

1071
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:07,800
excited reason I mentioned how important

1072
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:10,879
was the kind of training I

1073
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:13,880
re without that honestly without that

1074
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,440
Network my own Cort yeah not the leaders

1075
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,599
of Rockefeller oh you're talking about a

1076
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,800
community of practitioners kind of thing

1077
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:23,119
yeah oh totally yeah no that's that's

1078
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,559
the other objective of the of the

1079
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,760
November meeting is errans are going to

1080
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:30,280
be talking to Le and they're at the same

1081
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,680
stage of development of their seed

1082
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,240
system very exciting yeah they'll learn

1083
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:36,440
way more from the each other than they

1084
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:36,439
will

1085
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:43,000
