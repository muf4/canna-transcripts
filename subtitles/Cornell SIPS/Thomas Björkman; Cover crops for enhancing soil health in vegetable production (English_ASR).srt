1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:10,779
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:10,780
University it's on okay I won't use my

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:17,719
microphone yes I've talked about the

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,640
broccoli project you're quite a number

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:21,439
of times over the years but I realize in

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,839
this venue I haven't talked about my

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,820
cover crop work even though I talk about

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,910
it nearly every week some audience

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,859
during the fall and early but this would

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,990
be a good chance and especially as it

11
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,460
impinges on the work that a lot of you

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:38,539
are doing and sort of reinforces the

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,280
connections that we have around some of

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:45,070
these questions of production and

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:48,829
biology and so my big goal with the

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,869
cover crop work is to make vegetable

17
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:53,030
production more environmentally and

18
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:55,549
economically sustainable that's kind of

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,170
the big picture and you'll find that

20
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,929
everything probably fits into that big

21
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:04,040
picture and there will be a lot of

22
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:06,620
smaller threads so most of the work in

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,219
cover crops when I started was done for

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:12,829
field crops and field crops are very

25
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:14,150
very constrained they get planted in the

26
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:15,950
spring as soon as you can get in the

27
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,260
ground they get harvested when the

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,000
weather starts to fall and that doesn't

29
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,280
make for a very exciting cover crop

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,549
scenario vegetables are really different

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,379
and some of the things that really play

32
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:29,929
into how you think about putting cover

33
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:32,119
crops into a vegetable production are

34
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,850
one thing is that it's very high revenue

35
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,670
on the plus side for somebody who's

36
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:39,739
trying to change practices is that if

37
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,210
it's if what you're doing is useful it's

38
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:43,219
we're spending money on so people are

39
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:46,939
more likely to adopt it on the other

40
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:52,400
hand it messes things up it can cause

41
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:54,259
growers growers a lot of money and it

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,690
also in some of the decision making

43
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,909
getting the crop off the field is even

44
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:01,489
more important because you can easily

45
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:04,430
have a situation that we have a lot

46
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:06,289
field is too wet crop is ripe what do

47
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,030
you do well if you have ten thousand

48
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,500
dollars worth of crop on land that cost

49
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,330
five thousand dollars an acre what's

50
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,960
your call you're going to go in there

51
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:18,160
and write it up no doubt about it

52
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,840
terrible for soil health in a moment but

53
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,650
that's going to be the decision so you

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,479
end up with people doing things for

55
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,409
short-term benefits that are bad for the

56
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:31,299
long-term vegetables compared to other

57
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:33,340
crops produce very little organic matter

58
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,330
so there's a need to supplement that

59
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:39,009
with other things in the cropping system

60
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,680
tillage is traditionally very intense

61
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:45,250
with vegetables compared to most other

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,590
crops certainly compared to fruits even

63
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,969
even better bigger contrast than with

64
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:54,939
field crops and I'll talk about the

65
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:56,680
issues with village as we get into it at

66
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:57,879
the very high fertility setting it

67
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,490
particularly when you're harvesting

68
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:03,819
before seed maturity if the crop is

69
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,800
still green and growing it wants a high

70
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,239
nitrogen environment and so you're

71
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,950
harvesting when there's high nitrogen

72
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,110
you're leaving a high nitrogen residue

73
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:13,089
the nitrogen management becomes quite

74
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,770
different from a field crop that you're

75
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,629
harvesting your crops maturity when if

76
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:22,840
you've done it right you've run the soil

77
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:24,789
nitrogen down to zero and there are very

78
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,400
diverse rotations vegetable crop

79
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:29,679
producer generally is trying to harvest

80
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,659
for as much of the season as possible so

81
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,540
that you get paid for as much of the

82
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:36,039
season as possible

83
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,719
here we can grow tomatoes great and

84
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,189
deliver all kinds of tomatoes the second

85
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:43,270
week in September but if that's all you

86
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:45,069
guys you have no market so you have

87
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,480
harvest all season well for cover crops

88
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,000
that provides a lot of different

89
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,239
opportunities and it also creates the

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,550
need for a lot of different solutions

91
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:58,000
give examples of some of those but

92
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:01,210
should say here my my motivation for

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,039
really getting into the cover crops in a

94
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:08,740
big way I've been playing around with it

95
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:11,680
before was Carol McNeil so she retired a

96
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,930
couple of years ago from Cooperative

97
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,170
Extension but she was really key player

98
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,509
in the soil health program and really

99
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,720
worked very hard at getting cover crop

100
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:24,819
adoption and especially important to me

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,130
identifying very precisely what the

102
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,790
needs of the growers were the where

103
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:31,180
where

104
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,550
I in doing research in this area provide

105
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,959
more information and so finding that

106
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:39,939
highest unaddressed grower needs me she

107
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,029
was a really good partner in making sure

108
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:43,959
I was doing something useful and

109
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:45,969
understanding how to develop a

110
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:49,120
curriculum of information that's useful

111
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,550
to the Extension educator so it's not

112
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,860
research reports it's not a little fact

113
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,650
journal back there it's here's a set of

114
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,980
ideas a set of practices that you can

115
00:04:56,649 --> 00:05:02,739
actually learn and use and so that was

116
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:06,040
really important to my development to

117
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,300
extension and partnering with the soil

118
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,189
health team you'll see that a lot of

119
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,639
this is structured around the soil

120
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:16,839
health practices another kind of

121
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,879
introductory notion does something about

122
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:23,619
our geography and where my partnerships

123
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:25,810
have been in doing this work so the blue

124
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,100
and green on here is those are alpha

125
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,250
salsas are the really high quality

126
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:33,490
highly productive soils and you see they

127
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:36,910
run across the Ontario plain over into

128
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:39,610
Michigan quite a bit so Geneva and

129
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,560
Lansing are really very similar in many

130
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:45,009
regards I quite a bit of work with

131
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,550
Michigan State but we've got that band

132
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:51,069
and so having Geneva right

133
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,189
in the middle of that spot makes it

134
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:55,779
convenient not only because our our land

135
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:59,050
is just like the farmers land but the

136
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:02,139
farmers are right there to work with but

137
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:11,680
I'd say my work is intended to influence

138
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:13,959
two colorful areas on this map and yeah

139
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,439
so some some thought these can be sort

140
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:20,049
of takeaways if you want some practice

141
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,759
so one of the things I tried to focus on

142
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,970
is making sure that the cover crop is

143
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,159
managed is matched to the management

144
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,050
goal that the growers really need to

145
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,390
have something they are trying to

146
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,800
accomplish that is difficult to do with

147
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:34,990
the tool the other tools that they have

148
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,699
so bringing in a cover crop to do

149
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,199
biologically what they're having trouble

150
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,180
doing with their other set of tools

151
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,069
different cover crops do different

152
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,350
things different times of the season so

153
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,480
finding the right one and identifying

154
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:51,970
exactly what the management goal is

155
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:54,860
sometimes takes some shifts in thinking

156
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,330
another one it's really important to

157
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,910
reduce tillage if you want the cover

158
00:06:56,329 --> 00:07:01,250
crops to do much good and that's

159
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,810
something that's become more and more

160
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,459
clear to me over the past 10 years and

161
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,899
I'll show you some examples of that

162
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:11,180
so coupling with the reduced tillage and

163
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:14,239
vegetable program so on it's not air

164
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,699
Brian Brian they're doing really really

165
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,680
important work and so time with two

166
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:21,019
ideas in those two programs together is

167
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,030
important and with the cover crops

168
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,769
timing is really critical and usually

169
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:26,959
growers think about cover crops oh I'll

170
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:28,639
get it in when I get around to it and

171
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:32,379
that doesn't work any better for cover

172
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,519
crops and it does brother I'm sensitive

173
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:36,050
let's all start off with soil health

174
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:38,269
because that's been a real organizing

175
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,680
principle of this and a place where you

176
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:44,299
really have an opportunity to have

177
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:49,160
considerable improvement that's one of

178
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,319
the cynical statements about the soil

179
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,820
health report is that you get a

180
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,459
prescription for what to do and

181
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:59,300
typically it's reduced tillage and use

182
00:07:55,459 --> 00:08:00,739
more cover crops so some some people why

183
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,930
do I need to test if that's what it's

184
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,060
going to tell me but it tells you which

185
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,949
things do what's the specific management

186
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,889
goal is so here's the soil health test

187
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:12,039
report here's a eight indicators for

188
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:15,019
physical ones and for biological ones

189
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,879
that are typically coming out of the

190
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:18,799
report and these can be addressed with

191
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,569
reduced tillage and cover crops in

192
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,120
different ways and with cover crops it's

193
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:27,110
really different cover crops for each of

194
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,420
those indicators and they're related to

195
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,920
one another and I'm not going to dwell

196
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,139
on this one in fact I'm just going to

197
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:37,070
focus on the aggregate stability one for

198
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:39,860
today squeeze everything in so aggregate

199
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,800
stability is the soils aggregation and

200
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:47,269
kind of give you a picture of what that

201
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:50,000
can look like so the bad crumb here is

202
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:51,620
what ground looks like if you tell it a

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,190
lot don't put in enough organic matter

204
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,659
and

205
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:59,300
when it's wet it falls apart so there

206
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:01,039
are no crumbs in it there are no air

207
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:03,500
spaces in it if you try to break that

208
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,059
apart it will break into big clods and

209
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,230
it'll break into the individual mineral

210
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:11,689
particles so that's unfortunately taken

211
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,810
out of a vegetable field and this is

212
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:17,000
good crumb this is soil that was taken

213
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:19,039
next to a vegetable field it hasn't been

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,600
tilled it was in the hedgerow so it

215
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,009
looked like that but you can see those

216
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,899
crumbs they work like little ball

217
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:26,539
bearings so you can break up the soil

218
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,370
easily it tells fairly easily these

219
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:31,069
stick together because they're very well

220
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,289
glued together that's what we want

221
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,790
that's provides a lot more air spaces

222
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:38,110
for the roots to grow for respiration

223
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:41,419
and for the soil biology to work and

224
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:45,560
this is a picture of where those

225
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:48,949
aggregates come from so in this case

226
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:51,109
we're working with buckwheat which was

227
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,430
the first cover crop I chose to work

228
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,730
with because we'd been doing buckwheat

229
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:58,250
rain stuff and so this is the outside of

230
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,710
the root these are the root hairs you

231
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,230
see going out and you see there's all

232
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,570
kinds of the mineral particles in the

233
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,460
soil all kinds of different sizes right

234
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,129
that's important they're stuck together

235
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,410
to different extents now the cool thing

236
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:14,840
about this picture is that it's the soil

237
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:17,659
sheath so what Margaret did to get this

238
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,759
picture where she pulls the the wound

239
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:22,819
really out of the soil and then she

240
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:25,700
washed it with water and this is what's

241
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:29,390
stuck to the root this doesn't come off

242
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:32,390
and what's happened is the roof has

243
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:35,360
pushed so water is coming out of the

244
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:37,460
roots kind of make that point with a

245
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,259
bunch of mucopolysaccharides produced by

246
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,389
the root surface pushed out here and

247
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:43,669
that glues is stuff together and that's

248
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:45,919
about as far as the the water could get

249
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:48,500
well pushes a bunch of other things out

250
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:53,479
there so this is food for all the

251
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:56,269
biology of the rhizosphere and one of

252
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,839
the cool things about Cornell is that

253
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:01,970
there are at least a dozen labs working

254
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,070
very hard on what's going on in there

255
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,960
who's there what are they doing what do

256
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,120
they like how can we do good

257
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,620
we have them do good things for us so

258
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,320
there's tremendous activity right here

259
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,539
about what's going on in this picture I

260
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:21,860
find very exciting it's going to lead to

261
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:23,269
answers I want to know so the first set

262
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,940
of experiments I'm going to talk about

263
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:29,090
we're trying to figure out which cover

264
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,280
crop would be most helpful for improving

265
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,660
soil health and aggregate stability in

266
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,319
particular which we're going to talk

267
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:38,389
about here so there's a bunch of cover

268
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,310
crops available they have fine root

269
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:41,750
systems coarse root systems they grow at

270
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:45,619
different times of year they secrete

271
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:48,259
different things so in terms of just

272
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,960
practical we want to move our aggregate

273
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:53,870
stability up what should we use we

274
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,430
looked at two main windows one is after

275
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,679
an early vegetable crop so that we'd be

276
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:00,259
planting around the 20th of July and

277
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,839
then for a midseason cover crop planting

278
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,220
around the 20th of August and we didn't

279
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,110
worry about later than that because

280
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,730
these were the two time frames that were

281
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:13,250
of most interest and so we put this

282
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,800
experiment in where we had the same

283
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:18,559
cover crop for for off seasons in a row

284
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:20,959
and we had different vegetables in each

285
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,059
of the years so after four years how

286
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,320
much change were we able to produce we

287
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:27,399
knew that it was unlikely we'd see

288
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,720
anything in one year to rent for for

289
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,970
planting the same crop four times in a

290
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,420
row didn't want to push it any further

291
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:38,600
than that was enough and then looked at

292
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:42,229
various measures of soil health and crop

293
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,980
performance and just to orient you a

294
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:47,440
little bit this is from the soil health

295
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,649
handbook

296
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:56,090
what's good bad and terrible so with wet

297
00:12:51,649 --> 00:13:00,019
aggregate stability on a medium soil is

298
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:02,570
the dotted line so if you're if you want

299
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:07,549
green good you want an aggregate

300
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:11,420
stability of at least about so in the

301
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:12,500
30s here but the two fields I was using

302
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:14,779
we're down here

303
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,509
they're about eighteen and twenty there

304
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:19,279
are definitely in the red zone so they

305
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,879
were in bad shape one worse than the

306
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,409
others

307
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,480
so the question is can we put them up

308
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:26,379
push them out of the really bad zone at

309
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,629
least into the not so terrible zone

310
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:33,889
we're asking a lot of the cover crop at

311
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:38,088
this point but also a fairly common

312
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:41,750
situation so this is with the early

313
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:44,870
summer cover crops so the two colored

314
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:46,458
bars or the two different fields and the

315
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,669
first one is with where we had bare

316
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:52,159
ground in the offseason so just open

317
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:54,828
fallow so these are the aggregate

318
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:58,159
stability values after four years with

319
00:13:54,828 --> 00:14:01,849
the basically current practice and then

320
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:06,559
use yellow mustard buckwheat Sudan grass

321
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:08,629
annual rye grass and these are sort of

322
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,159
an order of how big the root system is

323
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:14,088
so thinking that a bigger root system

324
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:19,309
might have a bigger effect and what we

325
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:22,209
find is that there's some hints but

326
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:27,018
nothing is really coming out as

327
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:28,969
statistically significant and if you're

328
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:32,750
getting an improvement of one percent a

329
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:36,860
year to get up to 40 is going to be a

330
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:39,259
long haul so it's even even if it's

331
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:43,100
moving it's not moving very fast with

332
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:45,649
these early summer ones say these three

333
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,389
are only in the ground for about two and

334
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:48,970
a half months the early summer is nice

335
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,470
because you get the long days and warm

336
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,139
temperatures of July and August to work

337
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:56,500
with annual ryegrass actually survives

338
00:14:54,139 --> 00:15:00,589
into the spring so it's fortunate longer

339
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:03,740
but not moving this measurement these

340
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:05,240
are the late summer cover crops so again

341
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,310
the bare ground first so that's the

342
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,110
control but here we get to use more

343
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:10,669
we've got radish yellow mustard and

344
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,500
turnip so those are all crews first

345
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:16,519
they're all dying sometime during the

346
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:20,208
winter brian treated Kaylee our rains

347
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:25,730
and finally annual ryegrass is in turf

348
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:27,938
type so it's a finer sod root system

349
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,938
there

350
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:41,658
and the rhyme one kind of looks tempting

351
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:43,729
it's a very commonly used one but even

352
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:45,649
with that one and I'm a little wary of

353
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:48,379
it because triticale is almost exactly

354
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:49,849
the same thing and so if we had

355
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:51,678
something that was going to be

356
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:57,019
consistent I would want to see triticale

357
00:15:51,678 --> 00:16:01,399
up so what we're seeing in this highly

358
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:03,288
tilled system is that even cover

359
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,149
cropping very aggressively for four

360
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:08,538
years it's really hard to move the

361
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:11,028
needle and if you're planning on doing a

362
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:14,058
master's degree project and starting

363
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:22,489
from scratch this may not be the type of

364
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:24,678
experiment you want to do so what's the

365
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:26,629
deal with the tillage here so we were

366
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:28,458
tilling to plant the crop and we're

367
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:30,139
tilling to incorporate the residue of

368
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:32,868
the crop and prepare the ground for the

369
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:35,119
cover crop so that's quite a bit of

370
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:37,399
tillage in a year so this is a paper

371
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:40,729
that is about to come out from a

372
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:45,198
colleague and a see so they're working

373
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:47,869
on a similar soil and there they've done

374
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:50,568
wheat and betch as their offseason cover

375
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:52,639
crops and when they're and so this

376
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:54,408
measures the infiltration rate of water

377
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,979
which is pretty closely related to the

378
00:16:54,408 --> 00:17:01,068
aggregate stability so they moved it

379
00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:03,439
from an inch and a half with the fallow

380
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:07,308
up to a little over two inches with the

381
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:09,349
to cover a little bit since rains in

382
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:11,689
that range are really potentially

383
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:13,609
problematic that matters but look what

384
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:16,639
happens when you stopped tilling much

385
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:19,008
bigger increase in the water

386
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:21,258
infiltration and what did the cover

387
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:24,889
crops do when you stopped tilling much

388
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:28,999
bigger impact having five inches of

389
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:30,888
infiltration would be amazing there's a

390
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:34,909
lot of water that just goes into the

391
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:39,558
ground doesn't run off but the thing is

392
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:41,730
this is after 34 years

393
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,888
so that's a long time presumably

394
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,870
something happened before 34 years but

395
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:48,449
we know that by 34 years something has

396
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:50,819
happened and Harold Vanessa's group has

397
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,009
a trial similar to this going on up in

398
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:56,009
Aurora and I think they're five years

399
00:17:53,009 --> 00:18:00,360
into it or so and it's it's starting to

400
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:01,889
get interesting looking but there it's

401
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:08,158
not going to pull away like this for a

402
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:09,839
few more years by the looks of it so

403
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,889
what can we do to reduce tillage and

404
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,628
vegetables like we're going to take

405
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:14,219
advantage of this effect how should we

406
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:17,069
be thinking of this instead of adding

407
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,048
cover crops to overcome the tillage

408
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:21,528
saying that's probably not the way it

409
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:26,609
works it's we have to use cover crops to

410
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:27,929
avoid the need for tillage and so

411
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:32,008
thinking about what's going on

412
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:34,470
structurally in the soil so this is our

413
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:36,240
tilled soil and it's reconsolidated so

414
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,970
we fluff it up the plant stuff but it

415
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,499
has very little aggregate stability and

416
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,360
structural properties so it

417
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:44,839
reconsolidate slike that after by the

418
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:47,308
end of the season it's compacted again

419
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:49,918
so we keep fluffing it up growing stuff

420
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:51,408
and having it fall together so that's

421
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,419
that's why it's hard to make progress

422
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:55,769
what is what does no-till end up looking

423
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,350
like just having a picture in your head

424
00:18:55,769 --> 00:19:04,499
of what reducing tillage looks like and

425
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:06,959
this is one that I dug up so here we're

426
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:08,639
starting to get worm holes there's some

427
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,019
root pulls coming through there the

428
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:12,298
worms can go even where there's been a

429
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:13,769
bigger root so those things are

430
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:16,710
happening when the soil is wetter than

431
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:17,878
it is in this picture but you can see

432
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,509
that it's starting to develop a

433
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:24,808
structure where it can support weight it

434
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:30,058
can support your equipment but it's

435
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:32,519
still perforated and so the the source

436
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,740
of the air spaces is really different

437
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:36,269
than what you get when you do tillage so

438
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,399
this is what we're trying to drive for

439
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:40,319
so getting those whoop holes in there is

440
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:43,199
really important and then leaving it

441
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,868
alone and over a long period of time ten

442
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,639
to thirty four years is when you're

443
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:50,099
starting to get so much perforation that

444
00:19:47,638 --> 00:19:52,619
it actually starts to behave the way you

445
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:54,509
want it to and the

446
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:57,329
choosing a cover crop to work with this

447
00:19:54,509 --> 00:20:00,599
or to do that sort of thing is important

448
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:02,669
here's an example of different root

449
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,349
systems this is millet and sorghum Sudan

450
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,640
grass if you look at the seedlings when

451
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:10,469
they're coming up you can't tell the

452
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:12,030
difference you look really alike but you

453
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,620
look at those root systems if you want

454
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:15,019
to find root system with a lot of

455
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:18,709
surface area

456
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:22,920
millets your cover crop but if you want

457
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:25,440
really strong thick roots that can punch

458
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,480
through a compacted soil sorghum Sudan

459
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,920
grass as the thick roots that can do

460
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,150
that so the choice is really important

461
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,830
even though they know they're right next

462
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,390
to each other in the seed catalog and

463
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:38,129
they look alike it's easy to say well

464
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,380
they're out of this again grass I'll get

465
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,390
the miller well you've got to match the

466
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,330
cover crop with the purpose that you

467
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:48,090
have and I can't do this talk without

468
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:52,049
showing the aptly-named tillage radish

469
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:54,329
so if you're paid any attention

470
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:56,009
whatsoever to cover crops in this neck

471
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:57,449
of the woods for the last five years you

472
00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:00,960
will have heard a lot about village

473
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:03,179
riders it's all the rage I've got a

474
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,650
neighbor farmer who plants about 1,500

475
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:10,740
acres of it each year he's still cropper

476
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:13,019
but it's working for him and so what

477
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,569
everybody notices is wow it's a big old

478
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,639
daikon radish that makes it below 2 inch

479
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:19,589
hole in the ground which is nice but

480
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,780
it's not actually that deep this really

481
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:23,730
is where the dirt stops that's really

482
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:27,299
the soil level so it's only going down a

483
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:31,319
couple of inches so the action really is

484
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:33,629
there little tap roots and they have

485
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:35,460
strong gravitropism going to keep trying

486
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,800
to grow straight down I should have

487
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,350
rotated the picture to talk about

488
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:43,859
gravitropism but there you go you're

489
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:46,230
looking from above so they're a couple

490
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:48,808
of millimeters wide but a couple of

491
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:51,900
millimeters wide to punch a hole that's

492
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:53,549
big enough to get the worms through it's

493
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,230
big enough to get the beetles through

494
00:21:53,549 --> 00:22:00,450
the spring tails all the Meisel fauna

495
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,279
they can move around in the different

496
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,950
parts of the soil and open up the soil

497
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,599
profile in the previous picture does

498
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,419
this Udine and sorghum

499
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,308
those roots normally go down that deeper

500
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:13,950
is that only because they were grown in

501
00:22:11,308 --> 00:22:18,058
look at someone right the cylinder helps

502
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:20,190
no question but the Soudan grass

503
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:23,579
actually does have a pretty strong

504
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:25,558
imperative to grow downward it varies a

505
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:28,529
lot they have roots have a lot of cues

506
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:31,168
of gravity light water nutrients there's

507
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:33,808
a lot of things telling them where it's

508
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:35,400
worth putting more roots and they

509
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:37,678
prioritize and some things just

510
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,890
naturally prioritize gravity more and

511
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,950
the radish is one that puts that pretty

512
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:46,440
high up on the list physical restriction

513
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,470
is when they like to turn sideways if

514
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:53,120
they hit something hard and Thomas is

515
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:58,110
that daikon harvest harvest all

516
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:59,699
commercially well yeah can you eat them

517
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:03,058
they're perfectly fine to eat

518
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,580
I've eaten there's no problem there now

519
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:07,829
the seed companies that sell vegetable

520
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:09,178
seed will sell you daikon radish seed at

521
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:10,859
one hundred and seventy-five dollars a

522
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,990
pound and the cover crop companies will

523
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:15,869
tell you tillage radish seed at three

524
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,548
dollars of thousands so I'll let you

525
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:23,219
guess what the what the vegetable

526
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:26,579
companies are doing so they are they're

527
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:29,509
not quite the quality that will let you

528
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:34,949
compete in the high-end daikon radish

529
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:41,038
farmers market restaurant sales art but

530
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:44,069
it's a perfectly good daikon radish so

531
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:46,460
look where I'm left on this tillage

532
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:49,950
question is how can cover crops aid

533
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:54,690
reduced tillage and this is a picture of

534
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:58,140
one example where this is is after

535
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,659
harvest in the fall planting rye in the

536
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,409
between crop row spaces and planting

537
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:06,240
radish in the crop row spaces the Rye is

538
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:10,400
going to survive the winter and provide

539
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,650
a good cover the radish is going to grow

540
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,140
open up the rooting zone below the

541
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:18,120
radish and then it's going to die and it

542
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,550
will completely decomposed by springtime

543
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:23,219
so you'll have a seed zone all

544
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:24,960
reformed it may not require any tillage

545
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,200
at all or it may require very very

546
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,910
gentle tillage in the spring the Rye can

547
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,380
stay there until you're ready for it to

548
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:35,060
be done and then you can terminate it

549
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,740
with an herbicide and one of the

550
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:39,599
technologies that we have now that I'm

551
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,059
having a lot of fun with is the GPS

552
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:46,169
steering so that you can plant this with

553
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:48,720
your GPS and I've seen 100 acre fields

554
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:52,950
planted absolutely dead straight that's

555
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:56,130
theory but then the following year you

556
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:58,470
can come in and plant your crop exactly

557
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:04,020
where the radishes were not half an inch

558
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:06,269
over exactly where they were and even if

559
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:07,680
the Rye was killed early and is mostly

560
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:09,869
decomposed by the time they're coming

561
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,450
out the plant you still hit it perfectly

562
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:13,709
and you can come back to that spot the

563
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:25,049
following year in the year after that

564
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:27,900
and after that are you asking that yes

565
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:30,899
so then there was the whole rotation

566
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:34,230
question I mean it's so the question was

567
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:36,330
whether which crucifer you have to worry

568
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,980
about carrying over flea beetles for the

569
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:40,019
subsequent crop if you're going strong

570
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,750
and cold crop it yes absolutely that's a

571
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,029
problem so you have to choose rotation

572
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,089
crops appropriately so that they are

573
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:49,470
compatible in the rotation sequence

574
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:53,189
further complicating your vegetable

575
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:54,630
rotations so that is that's a specific

576
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,690
challenge you have a lot of constraints

577
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:00,360
that come in but I see this sort of

578
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:03,390
thing as having lots of promise for

579
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,679
vegetables and I did some trials this

580
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,960
year where we took these highly

581
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,029
compacted fields and we did the deep

582
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,130
zone tillage that honours program has

583
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:15,149
been working quite a bit on for

584
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:16,650
vegetables and planted beans which are

585
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,880
some of the wimpiest vegetables out

586
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:23,910
there and they did great first year out

587
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,560
so the idea would be to have to disco

588
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,720
cold turkey on this middle zone and to

589
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:30,149
stop filling it and do deep zone tiller

590
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,799
in that part as long as it needs it but

591
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:34,370
also use the cover crop so that that

592
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:37,308
tillage is more effective or can be

593
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:39,739
more gently so that is very much the

594
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:41,329
direction I see us going on soil health

595
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,630
and cover crops and vegetables

596
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:51,079
intimately tied in with the reduced

597
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:53,660
tillage so I'm going to switch over now

598
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:56,990
to some questions that growers have to

599
00:26:53,660 --> 00:27:01,160
get adoption so the first question is

600
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:04,150
where can i buy the seed but the other

601
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:08,420
major question is when should I plant it

602
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:10,580
and so the time to match the cover crop

603
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,490
to the planting date you need to get a

604
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:14,689
fast start you need to have it during a

605
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:18,230
part of the season where it produces

606
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:19,759
enough biomass and you also need to have

607
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,529
it during a part of a season so it will

608
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,569
not produce seed because cover crops

609
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:27,470
need to think wonderful weeds and so we

610
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:29,750
don't want those so having ones that die

611
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,690
or can be killed before they make seeds

612
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:34,849
is important because their day length

613
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:39,019
and temperature sensitive that can be

614
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:41,480
fairly predictable and showing this is

615
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:45,139
the slide is in every grower talk I give

616
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,789
because if you know how to farm do you

617
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,470
know how to get a fast start you know

618
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:52,730
how to get no gaps you know how to kill

619
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:54,410
things so if you want to be successful

620
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,569
with cover crops make sure you do those

621
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:59,000
things and then you're likely to do well

622
00:27:56,569 --> 00:28:01,490
and so I'm going to talk a little bit

623
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,140
about the fast start as the main part

624
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,609
we're getting to here so this is what a

625
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,400
fast start looks like with buckwheat

626
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:11,569
that's cover crop I'm gonna talk quest

627
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:13,460
in this experiment so for days you may

628
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:15,950
see it looks a little yellow so the

629
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:20,259
cotyledons are up on the fourth day

630
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:23,269
after planting at three weeks

631
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:26,329
essentially full cover at five weeks

632
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:27,859
time to kill you see the difference in

633
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:30,710
color between three weeks and five weeks

634
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:32,689
that color change is dramatic and it's

635
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:37,759
the signal to kill buck if you're going

636
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:40,009
cover cropping unmistakeable but so that

637
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,690
three weeks full cover that's part of

638
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:45,759
the smothering effect of cover crops

639
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:47,058
true if weed management is part of your

640
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,339
program

641
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,450
for sure and generally speaking you

642
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:54,230
don't want reads in your cover crop

643
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:56,840
anyway that's the seeding rate on

644
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,819
something like this this is 60 to 70

645
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:03,339
pounds in it there's this 160 pounds

646
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:09,378
nature but not not very high it's just

647
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:11,028
nice uniform cheek placement so we

648
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:12,949
wanted to find out when during our

649
00:29:11,028 --> 00:29:16,429
growing season can you plant buck weeds

650
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,870
and so one of this is the fast start

651
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:22,419
parameter so we're measuring ground

652
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:24,469
cover at three weeks somewhat

653
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:28,759
arbitrarily saying that 70 percent

654
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:30,288
ground cover at three weeks is good so

655
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:31,940
that's that's the number we're trying to

656
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:35,720
hit so I've got the horizontal line

657
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:40,269
across there and three very different

658
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:46,009
seasons produce some different curves

659
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:49,700
but in short having it so in the fall

660
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:51,829
it's in the in May it's really too cool

661
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,950
and it grows slowly it likes a little

662
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:58,368
bit warmer and so the weeds during

663
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,600
during May plantings the weeds will the

664
00:29:58,368 --> 00:30:02,928
early season weeds will beat the

665
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:05,298
buckwheat pretty consistently but if you

666
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:07,909
get into June and July and early August

667
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:10,759
it's looking good for a fast start so

668
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:14,659
that's pretty long and then the other

669
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:16,759
one is getting enough biomass and so

670
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:19,119
here we're looking at the biomass at 42

671
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:24,139
days so that's when we typically kill it

672
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:26,148
and June and July still look pretty good

673
00:30:24,138 --> 00:30:29,058
but once you get into August there's a

674
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:30,829
an abrupt drop and basically that's

675
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:33,109
because it gets cold in September and it

676
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,609
stops growing in September so even

677
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:37,248
though I came out of the ground like a

678
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:40,638
rocket because it was warm and white in

679
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:43,368
early July it slams on the brakes once

680
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:45,019
you get into seven September so the

681
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:49,368
August plant things don't actually do

682
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:51,740
well and so the thing is if you're

683
00:30:49,368 --> 00:30:54,499
you're busy you're this is crazy time of

684
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,329
year for vegetable growers and you're

685
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:58,069
harvesting and the end of July feels

686
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:58,918
just like the beginning of August

687
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:00,210
but the

688
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,549
difference between putting your

689
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,899
buckwheat in here and put in your bucket

690
00:31:02,548 --> 00:31:05,849
in there is the difference between

691
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:11,459
success and failure it's really

692
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:14,459
important to hit the date right so we

693
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:17,940
had a lot of data like that and we

694
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:20,579
developed a degree day model to figure

695
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,009
out when the planting date is that you

696
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:27,118
can get both the fastest start and

697
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:32,368
enough biomass and through the climate

698
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:35,339
centers we worked up a map for actually

699
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:39,388
covering the Midwest as well for the

700
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:45,599
last effective planting date of

701
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:48,178
buckwheat the thing that struck me about

702
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:52,019
this map is that if you look in the

703
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:54,179
Midwest you can see that the date zones

704
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:56,489
the borders between the date zones

705
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,869
pretty much follow the interstates so

706
00:31:56,489 --> 00:32:00,720
you can say oh it's this state if you're

707
00:31:57,868 --> 00:32:04,230
north of Interstate 70 but if you're

708
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,798
trying to talk about New York it's a

709
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:12,028
completely modeled it's really hard so

710
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:13,168
you need some sort of a local map or

711
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:18,659
something to tell you for a particular

712
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:20,639
farm what are you going for the other

713
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:23,580
thing that shows up pretty clearly is

714
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:25,558
that down here at Beltsville where a lot

715
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:26,819
of cover crop work gets done they're

716
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:29,849
dealing with a completely different

717
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:35,009
situation very very different timing

718
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:38,248
region so I also have worked a lot on

719
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:40,499
the crucifer cover crops which we never

720
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:44,269
use in broccoli production as sweet

721
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:46,769
needles and other reasons but they're

722
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:49,499
they're popular for a couple of reasons

723
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:51,239
one is that they're cheap to use seeds

724
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:54,839
cost the dollar two three or four

725
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:56,999
dollars use five or ten pounds per acre

726
00:32:54,839 --> 00:33:00,269
so the seed cost ends up being

727
00:32:56,999 --> 00:33:02,009
relatively low and this the amount of

728
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:08,278
stuff you have to bring out there is

729
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:11,190
fairly low with the small seeds so Bry

730
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:12,869
you're planting maybe 150 200 pounds an

731
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,308
acre

732
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:16,139
or in the similar range so you can

733
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:18,298
imagine if you have a 50 acre field this

734
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,159
is a lot of stuff you're hauling out and

735
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:23,639
driving around the field with but the

736
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,760
crucifer is it's a lot less much easier

737
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,350
and for the vegetable systems remember I

738
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,000
said that you're harvesting when the

739
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:31,709
nitrogen levels are still really high

740
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,380
both in the soil in the crop residue

741
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:37,440
these are great scavengers of nitrogen

742
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,690
and so they will they're a good tool for

743
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,100
soaking up that excess nitrogen carrying

744
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:44,070
it over to the next year so it's not

745
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:48,389
lost and so we did some similar work

746
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:51,329
with mustard so this is with an Brainard

747
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:53,940
in at Michigan State here

748
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:56,750
it's the Kellogg Biological Station and

749
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:59,460
the free vill farm here so both sites

750
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:05,089
had certified organic land that we could

751
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:07,890
work on an organic funded project and

752
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:10,848
weed control in the fall is especially

753
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:15,858
interesting through organic growers and

754
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:18,599
here again you can see that abrupt drop

755
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:22,019
from getting good biomass to getting

756
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:26,099
very little again very very abrupt

757
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:29,789
window closing and so there we developed

758
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:33,470
a degree day model and so the buckwheat

759
00:34:29,789 --> 00:34:36,119
model looks very similar to this and

760
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:38,428
what you can see in this model is that

761
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,960
there's a lot of degree days when it's

762
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:42,450
nothing nothing nothing nothing

763
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:47,329
and then fairly quickly it comes up and

764
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:49,710
makes however big it's going to be and

765
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:53,069
they collect more degree days in

766
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:57,630
Michigan also that was something you

767
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:59,760
notice consistently that there they have

768
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:05,190
would usually catch a little more season

769
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:07,109
but in most locations that rise happened

770
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:10,769
about the same place so we could do a

771
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:13,619
model for that also so we have basically

772
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:17,940
the same kind of map but now developed

773
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:20,900
for mustard and that's thankfully a

774
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:24,088
little bit simpler here in New York so

775
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,160
making statements about when to plant

776
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:28,409
though the mustard cover

777
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,858
and we've tested a bunch of different

778
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:34,828
crucifer and they're all the same from

779
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:36,480
the super process that have radish to

780
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:38,220
the really really cold hardy winter

781
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,980
canola and even though they're winter

782
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,509
hardiness varies the degree day

783
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,190
requirement for growth in the fall is

784
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,650
exactly the same on all of them so the

785
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:51,599
last planting date applies to all the

786
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:55,470
crucifer it's not just mustard so we

787
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:57,660
went another step along for helping the

788
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:59,608
growers so this is with video Neal and

789
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:02,639
Bryan Belcher with Cornell climate smart

790
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:04,500
farming which you can find a bunch of

791
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:08,038
tools at climate smart farming park

792
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,599
they're doing really nifty stuff and so

793
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,549
this is one of a set of tools that they

794
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,930
have that's tied in with the cover crop

795
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:18,269
decision tools that I've put online and

796
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:21,868
if you pick your location but not

797
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:23,759
everybody gets it again you can put your

798
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:25,980
farm your field if it's a big farm you

799
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,650
can put different fields some people are

800
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:33,659
at different elevations and so we've got

801
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:35,338
this for mustard Ryan buckwheat and it

802
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:40,199
says what's the probability of success

803
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:42,778
in here I define what success is and it

804
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:47,038
will show you the curve of your odds of

805
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:49,858
success and if you mouse along there so

806
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,900
I have the mouse on August 31st here it

807
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:56,940
tells you you have a 27% chance of

808
00:36:51,900 --> 00:37:02,548
success if yours you can see the history

809
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:04,278
since 1978 how many years there were

810
00:37:02,548 --> 00:37:05,699
enough growing degree days by that

811
00:37:04,278 --> 00:37:08,159
planting date

812
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:10,558
so some people like to gamble more than

813
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:15,690
others so that gives you the exact now

814
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:17,160
how risky is it and this is the scary

815
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,230
part to me

816
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:23,368
the dark line here is the 15 year

817
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:25,440
average and the gray line is the 30 year

818
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:28,200
average so it counts another 15 years

819
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,798
back in history so that difference

820
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:33,980
represents how much warmer the last 15

821
00:37:31,798 --> 00:37:38,190
years have been than the previous 15

822
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:40,110
that's a big difference and it shows up

823
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,150
on all of them through

824
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,650
the Northeast's all the locations we've

825
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,630
tried to chose up to different extents

826
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,720
and all of the cover crops that have

827
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:50,490
different degree day models shows up so

828
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:54,029
anyway we're providing growers with

829
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:56,099
tools like this and even though they're

830
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,190
targeted pretty narrowly to New York

831
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:01,679
vegetable growers it's not a huge group

832
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:04,110
in the audience it gets used fifty to a

833
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:07,109
hundred times a day year round so

834
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:15,960
there's the adoption is quite high so

835
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:17,550
that's been pretty rewarding so let's

836
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,409
show a little bit about weed suppression

837
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:22,950
which is another management goal not

838
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:25,619
soil health in the fast start so you

839
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:28,049
want the cover crop buckwheat here to

840
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:32,549
come up faster than the weeds and in

841
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:40,470
this picture it didn't if I saw this I'd

842
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:42,600
say whoops let's try that again so here

843
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:44,129
is a trial we did with buckwheat with

844
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,409
the question how much tillage do you

845
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:48,269
actually need in order to get a

846
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:50,099
buckwheat cover crop established

847
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:51,840
effectively enough to suppress the weeds

848
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:54,059
for the rest of the growing season so

849
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:58,019
this is after a pea harvest so they come

850
00:38:54,059 --> 00:39:01,110
off fairly early in the season and in

851
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:05,940
this the green is the buckwheat cover

852
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:08,789
crop orange are the weeds that come up

853
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,309
in the cover crop and yellow is the weed

854
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:12,779
pressure so that's how much weeds were

855
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:16,650
there if we didn't have a cover crop

856
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:18,840
there and with no-till you can see that

857
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,220
the weeds grow just as happily as they

858
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,559
would have otherwise and the buckwheat

859
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:24,480
doesn't really grow very well because it

860
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,549
has such a fine root system that just

861
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,360
straight no-till it goes into ground

862
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:31,860
that's too hard

863
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:35,280
and there are germinated weeds present

864
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:36,990
already but disking enough to just kill

865
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,300
the weeds and provide a little bit of a

866
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:42,779
seed bed now you get pretty good

867
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:46,590
buckwheat growth and you get a pretty

868
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:49,650
good suppression of the weeds so that's

869
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:51,870
planted immediately after tillage so the

870
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:54,070
the rule of thumb is wait a couple of

871
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:56,589
weeks so we're violating that rule

872
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:58,900
clearly we did a chisel treatment also

873
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:00,490
in case there was going to be puddling

874
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,840
but that turned out not to happen so

875
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:05,019
it's essentially the same treatment

876
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,420
there and essentially the same result

877
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:12,460
and then when we waited a week so the

878
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:15,700
buckwheat actually liked that and we did

879
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:18,119
get great weed suppression then but we

880
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:20,679
did it a couple of other years and it we

881
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,480
started to see some weed germination if

882
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:24,039
you wait the two weeks this is actually

883
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,750
weeds that have now germinated by the

884
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:27,789
time you plant so you're not getting a

885
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:32,170
fast start relative to the weeds and

886
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:33,730
having that much weed biomass is

887
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,389
actually worrisome because it's in your

888
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:39,190
cover crop and it could be going to seed

889
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:41,409
later so that's even though it's not a

890
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:43,420
real big bar it's it's a problem so we

891
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:45,699
don't want that so what we're saying is

892
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,740
you can after you've harvested a

893
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:51,819
vegetable you need enough tillage to

894
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:54,879
kill weeds get a seed bed but that's it

895
00:40:51,820 --> 00:41:00,280
no more and don't wait plant the cover

896
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:04,000
crop right away tried it later in the

897
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:08,350
fall with the mustard system and here

898
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:13,329
the the line is how big the cover crop

899
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:18,069
was the blue bar is the weed pressure

900
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:20,739
how many weeds were there this is weed

901
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:22,090
biomass and the red ones are how much it

902
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:23,319
is with mustard so if you see a big

903
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,730
difference between the blue bar and the

904
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,910
red bar that means the mustard was

905
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:29,380
working and so early in the season when

906
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:30,759
the mustards fade you're getting some

907
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:34,230
weeds freshened but also some

908
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:40,300
significant weed growth in the mustard

909
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:42,789
so this is Michigan this is New York but

910
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,789
one thing we're finding is when we go

911
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:48,039
late into the season we know we're not

912
00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:50,679
getting great weed suppression but we're

913
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:52,389
getting a lot of weed suppression even

914
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:54,549
when the mustard is really small in the

915
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:56,799
fall so there's some good competition

916
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,360
happening right away and when the

917
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,400
mustard comes out of the ground and is

918
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,170
competing with those green seedlings and

919
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:07,849
it's not so much and those about the

920
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:12,260
growth afterwards and then

921
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:13,940
yes the questions are specific weeds

922
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,250
being suppressed you can easily think

923
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:20,510
that it's that the cover crop targets

924
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:23,179
certain weeds and not other weeds and if

925
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:25,070
we look at just all weed numbers that

926
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:28,399
come up after you've incorporated the

927
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:31,430
cover crop we're finding that it's

928
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,700
essentially the same 100% means there's

929
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:39,829
no difference so we compared mustard and

930
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:42,769
no mustard but for something like lambs

931
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:47,059
quarters we're seeing a reduction by

932
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:49,159
half so great but helpful and then we

933
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:50,929
tested a haiku casino late mustard

934
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:52,789
against the low glucosinolate mustard

935
00:42:50,929 --> 00:42:56,179
thinking that this is the bio fumigation

936
00:42:52,789 --> 00:43:00,309
effect in the in the West and other long

937
00:42:56,179 --> 00:43:02,569
season areas they do bio fumigation with

938
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:05,630
mustards that are high in glucosinolates

939
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:07,910
so this is to try to assess how big is

940
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,920
the effect of bio few million versus all

941
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:13,819
the other effects that the cover crop

942
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:18,019
has and we found no difference like we

943
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:19,789
found no difference ever my thought is

944
00:43:18,019 --> 00:43:22,190
that by remediation isn't really what

945
00:43:19,789 --> 00:43:25,550
we're doing so you don't have to worry

946
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:30,409
about that in our region we go to a

947
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:32,720
couple of other weeds and they like

948
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:35,509
mustard mustard stimulates their

949
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:37,399
germination so it could go either way

950
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:41,780
and a couple of others that we were

951
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:44,269
worried about had even smaller effect so

952
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,519
we're not seeing super dramatic specific

953
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:53,780
effects here on the on the weeds that

954
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:56,539
come up after the cover crop so I'm

955
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:59,510
gonna dip that one and go to the

956
00:43:56,539 --> 00:44:02,059
take-home messages so that you're

957
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,890
thinking about the cover crop works that

958
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:06,110
I'm doing how it impinges on your work

959
00:44:03,889 --> 00:44:08,509
so think about using cover crops to

960
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:12,559
assist your efforts to reduce tillage

961
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:18,740
that's a good context and if you're

962
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:21,469
studying the effects of cover crops it's

963
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,739
helpful to look at it in the context of

964
00:44:21,469 --> 00:44:23,750
your

965
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:25,669
production systems a lot of the things I

966
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:27,380
talked about here we came up with a

967
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,480
different answer from the place where

968
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:31,039
that system was originally developed

969
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,019
because our constraints are different

970
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,730
the answers are different so if you're

971
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:37,369
going to be useful to the audience

972
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:40,329
locally here you need to test it in the

973
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:42,590
system with the constraints that we have

974
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:45,230
understanding the mechanics like the

975
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:46,910
allele bioaccumulation I just saw showed

976
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:50,119
on the last slide understanding

977
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:52,489
something about the mechanics now happen

978
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:55,789
how does the transition into no-tillage

979
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:58,339
work what's going on in the soil how are

980
00:44:55,789 --> 00:45:04,000
you getting the higher infiltration

981
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:07,910
rates for instance and I have to repeat

982
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,329
bass start no gaps kill on time seven

983
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:16,099
words you got those words you remember

984
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:18,559
nothing else and then fitting the cover

985
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:20,269
crops into the production system in as

986
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,699
many places possible to try to achieve

987
00:45:20,269 --> 00:45:24,710
that year-round roots that are going to

988
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:26,059
keep feeding that soil biota that's so

989
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:28,849
interesting you will all be learning

990
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:30,769
more about in a few years to come

991
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:34,039
and in doing this work I've collaborated

992
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:35,869
with a bunch of people so there's a ton

993
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:39,289
or I think it comes to about a ton and a

994
00:45:35,869 --> 00:46:24,769
half of collaborators that have been

995
00:45:39,289 --> 00:46:26,719
particularly involved in right so the

996
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:28,639
question is filling on time so garlic is

997
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:30,108
pulled out fairly early in the season so

998
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:33,108
you have time to plant buckwheat the

999
00:46:30,108 --> 00:46:34,819
buckwheat grows up nicely it's very

1000
00:46:33,108 --> 00:46:35,568
different root system and disease

1001
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:38,390
profile

1002
00:46:35,568 --> 00:46:42,440
from the garlic it's presses the weeds

1003
00:46:38,389 --> 00:46:45,379
for the rest of the summer but a lot

1004
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:49,789
more than 42 days so okay it's flowering

1005
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:51,979
it's making seeds so didn't it killed on

1006
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:54,049
time the way I described it but what

1007
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:56,328
Donna also said we don't really have a

1008
00:46:54,048 --> 00:46:59,208
problem with weeds presumably buckwheat

1009
00:46:56,329 --> 00:47:01,190
being in that so it is making seeds but

1010
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:03,219
the rest of your management is taking

1011
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:06,170
care of the weeds seedlings that result

1012
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:07,999
it cultivates really easily so some

1013
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:10,009
people don't worry about them and so in

1014
00:47:07,998 --> 00:47:12,288
your case killing on time is whenever

1015
00:47:10,009 --> 00:47:13,909
the frost gets them and then you have a

1016
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:23,259
no tillage system and in the springtime

1017
00:47:13,909 --> 00:47:25,548
you have good good conditions so yes so

1018
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:29,119
with buckwheat you probably do lose

1019
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:31,579
nitrogen over the season because it will

1020
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:35,059
decompose a lot during the winter so as

1021
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:37,759
long as it remains protein into the

1022
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:41,269
spring it's likely to stay in the system

1023
00:47:37,759 --> 00:47:44,809
but if it decomposes to the point where

1024
00:47:41,268 --> 00:47:48,258
you have nitrates or even even amino

1025
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:50,930
acids to some extent the nitrate will be

1026
00:47:48,259 --> 00:47:53,298
nitrifying time you have saturated soil

1027
00:47:50,929 --> 00:47:57,048
which you will have guaranteed some time

1028
00:47:53,298 --> 00:47:59,028
before planting and and it also leach

1029
00:47:57,048 --> 00:48:01,670
out if there's if there's leaching going

1030
00:47:59,028 --> 00:48:05,298
on so there the the amino acids will

1031
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:07,699
also leach out organic matter so if it's

1032
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:09,469
trying to keep it from decomposing too

1033
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:27,440
much before spring time is the goal and

1034
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:29,108
buckwheat is going to so how long does

1035
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:34,818
it take to get the seed from buckwheat

1036
00:48:29,108 --> 00:48:37,538
so the the 42 day thing is actually very

1037
00:48:34,818 --> 00:48:42,558
closely related to that because you

1038
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:45,949
start getting viable embryos very soon

1039
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:49,640
after that and a lot of the times if you

1040
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:51,809
kill buckwheat by mowing there's little

1041
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:54,960
branches that are left with the seed

1042
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:57,389
heads and they'll actually sit there and

1043
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,838
mature and so you can produce quite a

1044
00:48:57,389 --> 00:49:02,730
lot of seeds from those while they're

1045
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:04,739
decomposing well while the rest of the

1046
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:07,349
plant is decomposing the cedar maturing

1047
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:09,539
so even though it would typically be 70

1048
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:14,030
days until you've harvested commercial

1049
00:49:09,539 --> 00:49:18,179
seed selling it at even 50 days you're

1050
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:27,260
likely to get seeds out of that one it's

1051
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:30,118
pretty touching this idea of like how

1052
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:32,819
spatially distributed those actually

1053
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:41,099
occur like are we talking cuz they're

1054
00:49:32,818 --> 00:49:43,259
generally uniform compaction actually

1055
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:44,849
break it up is it like are you sort of

1056
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:55,980
like just gonna punching a hole through

1057
00:49:44,849 --> 00:50:01,700
it yeah yeah so the structure of the

1058
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:04,980
compaction well we have a couple of

1059
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:07,799
compaction tools that we use a lot so

1060
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,568
one is the moldboard plow so as it goes

1061
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,760
along it's actually lifting the soil

1062
00:50:09,568 --> 00:50:14,699
it's a big heave so the counteracting

1063
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,430
force is pushing against the soil

1064
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:19,559
downward with the ploughshare and so

1065
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:23,549
that is where the plow pan comes from

1066
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:25,889
and if it's at all moist down there and

1067
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:29,700
here it's usually moist down there that

1068
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:32,279
creates a pretty uniform compaction plow

1069
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:36,029
pan that will be uniform across the

1070
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:38,490
field it'll be thicker where the soil is

1071
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:40,530
wetter so if there are wetter spots in

1072
00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:42,868
the field which is typical of our fields

1073
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:45,990
they'll be worse our other tool is the

1074
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:48,720
disc that that's a much shallower level

1075
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:52,139
but it scours as it goes across so it

1076
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:55,709
can make this nice glossy area just just

1077
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:58,429
below the seed couple of inches down so

1078
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:58,429
he come down

1079
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:09,119
so for having the cover crops grow

1080
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:10,909
through its really the lower one the

1081
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,940
plow pan I think you're thinking about

1082
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:16,558
and they're yes they would be pushing

1083
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,778
sideways so it's being compacted

1084
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,940
vertically so ultimately you would want

1085
00:51:18,778 --> 00:51:27,539
to be moving the soil up and having the

1086
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:29,699
air spaces take up that space and that's

1087
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:31,979
really the only direction you can push

1088
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:34,170
so eventually it will get there but as

1089
00:51:31,978 --> 00:51:41,848
the roots go through yet they're pushing

1090
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:43,469
radially around the know they're

1091
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:59,278
perforating the compaction is how I

1092
00:51:43,469 --> 00:52:01,349
think about it that's right yes so this

1093
00:51:59,278 --> 00:52:06,920
has been a production of Cornell

1094
