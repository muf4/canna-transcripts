1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:10,800
so thank you for having me I'm really

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,169
excited to be here most of the time I'm

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,289
talking to audience

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:18,809
audiences of artists which is one kind

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,000
of talk and one kind of audience but a

8
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:23,309
lot of what I do is really meant to be

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,079
bridging and translating vocabularies

10
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:28,979
between different disciplines and

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:32,039
addressing over specialization when we

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,039
have complex problems to address and

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,738
complex systems to deal with so as

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:41,100
you're honest men shinned I was a

15
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:44,640
faculty member for about 15 years at a

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,609
number of different art schools and my

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,590
work as an artist kept moving me closer

18
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:52,350
and closer to what I could only

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,350
understand as research and there was no

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,719
vocabulary in the art world for

21
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:02,489
conducting research by making art work

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,259
and so I left and became what I've been

23
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:07,170
told is now an independent scholar which

24
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:10,709
meant I needed an organization to back

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:15,959
me up and I invented one and so what I

26
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:18,179
do is I work with artists to recognize

27
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:22,909
that their process of making art is a

28
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:24,959
form of research and that research that

29
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:29,478
scientists or other artists or other

30
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:32,280
disciplines may do is also producing art

31
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:34,560
that they are related to each other and

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,200
a really important way so I'm gonna fly

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,209
through a bunch of material as quickly

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,349
as I can so that we can have a

35
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:41,399
conversation about it because I'm

36
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:43,679
particularly interested in what

37
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:47,069
questions you may have and how you may

38
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:48,959
see your own relationship to the kinds

39
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:54,259
of learning and the ways of knowing that

40
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:57,478
artists use so the first question maybe

41
00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:00,450
you're all asking and I'm often asked is

42
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,879
what is it that artists actually do does

43
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,990
anyone have a quick pithy answer about

44
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,189
what artists do

45
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:10,469
sometimes it's like what do you do I'm

46
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:11,819
an artist and they're like okay I don't

47
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,210
know what that is but that's a good

48
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:19,319
answer

49
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:20,670
yeah observe the world create an

50
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,469
interpretation on it right so you're a

51
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:25,109
step ahead you're already like

52
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:27,689
recognizing that the observation that's

53
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,890
the big part right a lot of people say

54
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:32,159
well what do you do you make artists

55
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:33,779
make art right it's like they they look

56
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,120
at the interpretation look at the object

57
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,650
that artists are producing as the result

58
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,670
of being an artist

59
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:45,569
so it might be easier to comprehend if I

60
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:47,489
ask you what do scientists do what

61
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:51,509
anyone in this room say oh we make

62
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:54,780
science so there's a much better

63
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:56,310
vocabulary I think at least in the

64
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,199
sciences for what it is the scientists

65
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,909
do because there's there are systems

66
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,089
there are methods that's basically you

67
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:05,370
know science is understood as a means of

68
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,920
learning about the world there are

69
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,349
structures through which you you stage

70
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:15,149
your learning and the fact is that art

71
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:17,370
actually is the same thing so even

72
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,200
scientists also use the similar

73
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,879
vocabulary to artists right how do you

74
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:26,459
know if you've what you've done is

75
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:28,139
useful in science the thing works in art

76
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,170
we talk about the same thing an artwork

77
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,238
works like we can't necessarily describe

78
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,339
why because we haven't built up that

79
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,289
vocabulary that's a part of the problem

80
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,039
that kind of address among artists but

81
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:42,810
we recognize that something works and so

82
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,639
I see artists and scientist is

83
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,709
essentially cousins right we're related

84
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,329
to each other and we're related around

85
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,930
this idea that what we do is we learn

86
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,480
about the world we produce knowledge

87
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,870
about the world around and within us so

88
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,518
this is a super loaded slide with tons

89
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,230
and tons of historical implications that

90
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,219
you can take snapshot of and email me

91
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:08,369
about later but this is kind of a rough

92
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:10,280
Hydra of the creation of knowledge and

93
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,560
understanding particularly in the West

94
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,849
where once scientists and artists were

95
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,608
the same thing we were natural

96
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:20,079
philosophers I observed the world around

97
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:22,849
us we tried to make sense of it

98
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,120
then the Enlightenment came the

99
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:30,350
empirical method came and scientists

100
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,720
became scientists and no offense but at

101
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,570
the time the science wasn't very good

102
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,260
all right the method was good but the

103
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:42,050
but it was still very crude the result

104
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:44,420
of that was that artists became

105
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,949
romantics they looked at what scientists

106
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,689
were doing trying to break the world

107
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:51,050
apart and understand its constituent

108
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:53,389
pieces and artists said what about the

109
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,660
ineffable what about spirit what about

110
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:58,909
soul what about faith right and so art

111
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,689
and religion became bound together in

112
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:05,000
this idea of romance and that was

113
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:08,269
romanticism what I have called art

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,579
religion and then with modernism are in

115
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:12,560
religion had its own schism and so here

116
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:14,079
we see like a kind of disciplinary or

117
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,189
sort of knowledge production

118
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:23,269
categorizations vision so the thing is

119
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:25,819
that we so scientists could collect data

120
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:27,709
right like that is the empirical method

121
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:29,599
you observe you experiment you gather

122
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:32,060
data and then you synthesize that data

123
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,680
it makes sense it so artists do the same

124
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,379
thing but we don't have a vocabulary for

125
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,879
it so in art school we don't recognize

126
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:40,550
what kind of knowledge we're producing

127
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,259
we just create the objects and so what

128
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,319
artists produce this is what artists are

129
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:50,379
taught we are taught to make art ok we

130
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:52,399
bring it into class and we critique it

131
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:54,050
so what I do with artists literacies

132
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,810
Institute is I bring together artists at

133
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,670
all stages of their career and do these

134
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,800
interdisciplinary workshops I work with

135
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,629
artists one-on-one and I keep asking the

136
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,790
same question over and over again what

137
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:07,339
do you know and how do you know it so if

138
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,620
I ask an artist that that can be very

139
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:12,169
challenging for a lot of artists I just

140
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:17,180
have a hunch I can feel it I can sense

141
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:19,780
it right I use my intuition so I call

142
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,370
these things artists literacies you know

143
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,679
point that out and why why it is a

144
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,840
literacy in a moment but an artist

145
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,790
literacy they are senses there are

146
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,179
sensitivities they are our ways of

147
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,430
knowing

148
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,160
so every artist I believe may have

149
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,348
different ways of knowing and I suspect

150
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,120
that our artistic disciplines our media

151
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:40,469
our different ways of learning that

152
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,810
we've selected and reflect the

153
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:47,849
possession of unique literacies unique

154
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:49,228
ways of knowing about the world so the

155
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:51,300
reason it's a literacy is because a

156
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:53,668
literacy has to go in two directions if

157
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,650
you can just read but you can't write

158
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:57,029
you aren't fully literate if you can

159
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,620
write you can't read you weren't fully

160
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:02,418
literate and illiteracy doesn't

161
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:06,449
necessarily have to deal with only words

162
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:09,389
so most of the everyone in the room is

163
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:12,419
almost an environmental scientist a

164
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:15,449
scientist of some kind so I don't know

165
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:17,519
anything about environmental science you

166
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:21,509
know that's that's like I come in just

167
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:23,218
not knowing and that's all right so I

168
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:24,840
don't know anything about it I don't

169
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:26,189
know what you know and I don't know how

170
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,959
you know it I don't know about your

171
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:32,038
methods I could come to school here I

172
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:34,019
would probably learn a lot but as a

173
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:37,918
filmmaker if I spent a few weeks here

174
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:40,740
among you with a camera and spoke with

175
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,439
you and Biggers do talked with you and

176
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,908
watched I would start to learn a lot

177
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,978
about environmental science I would

178
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:50,819
learn it the way that I learned which is

179
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:53,399
I tell stories I make narrative and

180
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,468
causative connections between things and

181
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:59,339
the thing that might surprise you is

182
00:07:55,468 --> 00:08:00,269
that in practice in doing this I may

183
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:01,888
actually learn things about

184
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:03,478
environmental science and environmental

185
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:07,829
scientists that you yourselves don't

186
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:10,139
know so having that observer present

187
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:12,089
right is can be a really very powerful

188
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,960
thing there are new things that we can

189
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:19,500
learn and that's because I have what I

190
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,839
call a literacy in narrative narrative

191
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,348
itself I would define as perceived

192
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,879
causation when you go and watch a movie

193
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:28,560
these different clips of footage are

194
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,509
stuck together and they make sense to

195
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,879
you because you perceive causation

196
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:35,579
between those clips that's the mental

197
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,620
and cognitive process that we visit in

198
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:41,478
an editing room and spend months poring

199
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,179
over does cut a make sense with cut be

200
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,940
if we think that an audience would

201
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:49,399
recognize causation between a and B then

202
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,690
there's a narrative connection the same

203
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,190
thing happens if I'm just sitting here

204
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,100
with a camera and I'm looking around the

205
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:58,070
room I'm making kind of very quick rapid

206
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,649
I'm reading right using my literacy I'm

207
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,028
reading I'm saying something people are

208
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,708
responding in a certain way and I'm

209
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:06,220
looking around and I'm making narrative

210
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:08,028
connections so this is a way of knowing

211
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:13,339
they don't teach that in film school

212
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:16,278
though so perceived causation and this

213
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:19,269
is a model project where I was testing

214
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:23,539
this in Uganda actually trying to

215
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:25,370
understand why elephant and ivory

216
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:28,480
bearing animal populations are declining

217
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,889
in some places in rising and others I

218
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,360
went in looking through the lens of

219
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:35,028
perceived causation so known as

220
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,730
narrative if we can tell a story about

221
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:38,689
why certain systems are working better

222
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,360
than other systems

223
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,579
maybe we can understand something

224
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,970
positive about it and this was a real

225
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:49,549
puzzle because across Africa certain

226
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,589
parts of East Africa we're seeing

227
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:53,208
elephant populations rise and certain

228
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,570
parts of seeing them fall and yet the

229
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:58,250
same interventions were being applied in

230
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,920
both of those places so there was

231
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,570
something different in one context as

232
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,399
opposed to another one and they didn't

233
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,890
know what it was and I said when maybe

234
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,299
if we told the story about it we might

235
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:13,399
be able to I'll be able to see something

236
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:15,259
we couldn't see so this is a kind of

237
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,089
visualization of what that cognitive

238
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:18,980
process to a filmmaker looks like when I

239
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,720
look at a film frame okay I don't

240
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,570
actually see these squares but these

241
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,730
squares represents a way of looking for

242
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:29,000
a filmmaker that is within a single

243
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:32,930
image there is a ton of material a ton

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,539
of visual information that I'm able to

245
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:37,609
read and I'm recognize Ono that my

246
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:41,088
audience is going to read how my

247
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,100
audience again sad to say is probably

248
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:44,810
mostly illiterate mostly visually

249
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,230
illiterate because we don't teach visual

250
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:50,568
literacy the way we teach verbal and

251
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,278
textual literacy but you will look at an

252
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:54,919
image and you will start to make very

253
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:58,820
quick evaluations about people

254
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:00,439
context tone mood emotion because you're

255
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,528
human beings right because you see that

256
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,639
thing you can perceive these things this

257
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:06,049
is the difference between being able to

258
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,329
watch a film and being able to make a

259
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:10,309
film anyone in the room can watch a film

260
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:12,739
it does take a lot of work and training

261
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:15,259
to be able to make a film so this is

262
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,909
within one film frame okay and there are

263
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,458
three categories of knowledge in that

264
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:21,889
film frame then the next film then the

265
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:23,179
next cut comes along and there's three

266
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,049
more categories of knowledge and they

267
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:27,679
speak to each other

268
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:29,599
so there's not only intramural or intra

269
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,638
frame information but there's also inter

270
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,769
frame information and it very quickly

271
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,278
multiplies and a film becomes a really

272
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:40,399
complex sight of knowing like cognitive

273
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,500
and subconscious knowing most of the

274
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,929
time you get to see that knowledge in

275
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,899
the form of a continuous stream of

276
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:49,849
scenes a film and I started to wonder

277
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:52,070
what it would look like if it wasn't all

278
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,190
in a line but if we were able to hop

279
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:58,790
around the media based on things like

280
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:01,880
decisions that got made behaviors and so

281
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:04,689
this is a map of narrative linkages

282
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:07,220
between different seasons in the film

283
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,930
that conceivably we could follow and

284
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,360
learn different things about the

285
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:14,659
characters in the film the people who

286
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,820
are living these experiences so all of

287
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:18,889
this is a kind of what we call coding

288
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,629
right you know we're doing it in an

289
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:22,309
editing room most filmmakers are not

290
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:23,899
doing it consciously it's a lot of just

291
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:25,189
dialogue and discourse in the editing

292
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:27,740
room does this work

293
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,300
it does not work you iterate you try it

294
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,000
again and again you show people rough

295
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:34,039
cuts right so it's a very again kind of

296
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,360
scientific method it just like yeah it's

297
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:37,879
there it's almost there it doesn't quite

298
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,278
work and then and then you end up with

299
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:44,419
the product but we only get known for

300
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:46,698
our product so that's how it works for a

301
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:49,519
filmmaker and then I started to wonder

302
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:51,078
well what about other forms of art

303
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,720
making what about other creative

304
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:54,948
practices

305
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,360
besides narrative what are these other

306
00:12:54,948 --> 00:13:02,958
kinds of literacies that might be out

307
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:04,389
there and I was actually just just the

308
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,799
other day actually at this Hans Hawk

309
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:08,799
show at the new museum and

310
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,310
you know this is a really interesting

311
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,409
artist in the sense that he's been doing

312
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:20,439
these kinds of investigations in things

313
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:24,819
like these natural phenomena for a long

314
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:27,760
time this mound of dirt when an early

315
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,710
Earth work what happens if I put a pile

316
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:35,500
of dirt and a bunch of grass seed in an

317
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:39,129
art gallery the grass grows he is also a

318
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,340
detective so in the 1960s he uncovered

319
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:44,470
an enormous real estate scheme in New

320
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:47,500
York City and in fact the Guggenheim

321
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:50,740
wouldn't exhibit it because he said this

322
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:56,649
is an art right this is like police work

323
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:58,149
real estate work yeah hon tock is being

324
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:00,220
displayed in the in the new museum so

325
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:04,090
what are the outcomes of that right now

326
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,100
it's being consumed as entertainment and

327
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,320
this is again because of the structures

328
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,970
of the art world that people can only

329
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,129
recognize the finished product but the

330
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:15,610
fact is that Hans Hawk learned things

331
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:17,529
nobody else could knew right and there

332
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,230
was no mechanism for him as an artist to

333
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:22,120
bring that learning to the world he

334
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,590
could bring it to a journalist right he

335
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,620
could bring it to scientists but those

336
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,570
connections didn't exist I imagine you

337
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,210
might look at something like grass grows

338
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:35,070
and all kinds of ideas come to mind

339
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:37,060
right to the soil what kind of grass is

340
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,879
where's the light the temperature all

341
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:42,549
these things you have literacies that

342
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:47,159
Hans Hawk didn't he is just trying

343
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:49,689
something out but he's this investigator

344
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,490
so the question is what are the kinds of

345
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:55,660
data that are being crunched when an

346
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:57,519
artist is producing their work right

347
00:14:55,659 --> 00:15:00,870
instead of

348
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,919
you know what we make as just art

349
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,720
there's also something important which

350
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:08,049
is our process how do we get to that

351
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,610
point so I'm calling these primary texts

352
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:12,789
and producer texts because if I call

353
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:16,629
them texts texts can be coded texts can

354
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:18,490
be analyzed and interpreted so artists

355
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:20,320
produce art that's true but in a much

356
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,930
bigger way we spend most of our time in

357
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:27,010
our process right sketching

358
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:29,289
thinking making memos making notes and

359
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:32,500
and we end up with lots and lots of

360
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:35,169
texts and tend to go unanalyzed artists

361
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,700
are taught to hide that stuff away right

362
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:37,929
don't you can't put that in the gallery

363
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,470
that's not part that's not our finished

364
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:43,149
product and then something else that art

365
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,660
produces of course is its effect on

366
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:48,279
people in a much bigger way lots of

367
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:51,579
people will watch a film and things are

368
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:53,649
happening in the sensibilities and in

369
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:57,370
the hearts of the people who experience

370
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:59,500
that film as the honest mention that I

371
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,110
also work as an impact producer right so

372
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,629
this is a made-up job that people

373
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,039
invented about ten years ago especially

374
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:08,110
specifically around social issue

375
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:10,839
documentaries which is how do you make a

376
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:14,980
film and then contextualize it so that

377
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,990
it can create social change I don't like

378
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,389
the I don't like the framework of impact

379
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:21,909
partly because it's a little colonial

380
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:23,769
the idea that like I'm a fast moving

381
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:26,169
object and I can impact another

382
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:30,009
community or society with with my

383
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:31,629
artwork I prefer engagement but impact

384
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:34,179
producer is the term there are companies

385
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:34,600
that do this for films they take your

386
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:36,699
film

387
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,850
they contextualize it they survey the

388
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:43,210
audiences they do social science around

389
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:46,389
how people perceive subject they try and

390
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,670
Bill agendas and engagement campaigns

391
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:50,529
sometimes to create policy change in

392
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:52,269
address legislators sometimes to create

393
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:55,029
community change or educational programs

394
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:56,919
but the point is that the film is no

395
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:59,850
longer the end product right the impact

396
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,849
now is the product

397
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:05,220
so you make an artwork it has an effect

398
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,759
on audiences and whether we like it to

399
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,769
or not

400
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,529
it hasn't if those audiences then have

401
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:12,720
an effect on our process okay so I'm

402
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,220
gonna listen to people at my show I'm

403
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,779
gonna listen to people who have talked

404
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,578
about my previous work and that's going

405
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:21,838
to inform the process and create this

406
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:24,419
cycle my previous art is also going to

407
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:27,480
inform my process my process is also

408
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:30,330
going to then touch on the audiences and

409
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,299
so this is the churn of your artistic

410
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:35,939
process the art itself is a very small

411
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:41,220
part of it and what I'm interested in is

412
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:43,620
what kind of data exists these effect

413
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,170
bubbles in this process bubble how can

414
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:48,869
we code that and how can we see the

415
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:52,320
knowledge that's being produced there so

416
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:55,500
for all kinds of artists there are these

417
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:58,279
kinds of texts this is what I call a

418
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,309
knowledge engine right an artist is

419
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:04,579
basically driver of a knowledge engine

420
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:06,629
but the artists can't all by themselves

421
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:10,500
capture all that knowledge there's much

422
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:13,440
too much in there so I'm working with

423
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,970
actors who have recognized that their

424
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:21,390
literacy in being able to embody and

425
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:23,910
verbatim perform real living people are

426
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:26,490
a knowledge engine for audiences to

427
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,720
identify implicit biases and how their

428
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:31,650
political preferences are actually

429
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,170
shaped in a spectacled environment so

430
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,900
Lindsey Graham went embodied by a female

431
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,490
actor people perceive this person very

432
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,980
differently and recognize that their

433
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,390
political preferences are not

434
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,220
necessarily all their own they have deep

435
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,690
structural implicit biases that are

436
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,730
affecting those things Lindsey Graham

437
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:51,870
gets away with things that this actor

438
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:55,019
cannot audiences respond very different

439
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:57,119
ways with the same group of actors we're

440
00:18:55,019 --> 00:19:00,660
now doing this for the Democratic

441
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:03,149
primaries by body gender and race

442
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:07,019
swapping all the Democratic candidates

443
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:08,160
we're testing people and their own

444
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,069
perceptions of their political

445
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,230
preferences and

446
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:16,490
these are really really surprising the

447
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:18,779
fact is as I said we go in not knowing

448
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,970
and we aren't there to tell people who

449
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:23,339
to vote for but what we do find out is

450
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,440
that we're at people don't actually know

451
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:27,539
why they prefer the people in the

452
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,029
candidates that they do so there's their

453
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:32,129
preferences are being shaped by a lot of

454
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:34,470
factors that they're conscious of and so

455
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,910
what this does is it allows us to get

456
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,308
them to see and think more critically

457
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:41,160
and I think this is really important in

458
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:42,928
terms of resilience you know we live in

459
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,090
a democracy that is driven by spectacle

460
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:46,830
and therefore our choices are not really

461
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:50,609
our own if we are not critical and

462
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:52,678
conscious of the spectacle so I'm

463
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:54,449
working with a sculptor who is

464
00:19:52,679 --> 00:20:01,890
interested in studying social dynamics

465
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:06,210
as form and here we are again this is a

466
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:08,040
choreographer looking for methods and

467
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,289
the qualitative data in what we call

468
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:14,069
applied choreography what does her

469
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:17,750
familiarity with body kinetics and the

470
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:20,339
movement of an organism have to do with

471
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:23,009
she's both a choreographer and a

472
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,240
demographer so the city of New York so

473
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:27,000
she also studies the movement of

474
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,640
populations the changes of community

475
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,808
changes of neighborhoods and what we're

476
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,100
trying to do is build a bridge between

477
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:38,178
those two ways of knowing so each of

478
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:41,219
these experiences performances

479
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:44,070
choreography is sculptures any artwork

480
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,140
any photograph any film can be coded

481
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:49,379
right we can code those and we can code

482
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,509
all of the producer texts that are made

483
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,210
in the mean time as well and from that

484
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:56,129
there's a data right that's the

485
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,150
information that's the but there might

486
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:02,850
be data types that we don't recognize

487
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:06,030
importantly data is not knowledge so

488
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:09,289
it's not enough just to gather the data

489
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:12,389
but we also have to synthesize it so

490
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:16,259
knowledge exists only within a

491
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:17,850
consciousness data can exist outside of

492
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:19,769
the world on its own all right we need

493
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:22,939
conscience we need a conscience or

494
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:25,819
consciousness to recognize knowledge

495
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,320
um and so I was wondering you know do

496
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,149
artists just go out and gather

497
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,250
information without recognizing that its

498
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:37,400
information and then skip ahead to

499
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:40,700
synthesizing into our works and vice

500
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:45,200
versa and I don't know you know to what

501
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,789
extent is synthesis within science not

502
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,400
acknowledging certain kinds of data

503
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:51,730
types not acknowledging or recognizing

504
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,720
even the presence of kinds of knowing

505
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,940
other than within the scientists

506
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,309
themselves the systems that they're

507
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:03,590
working and so I feel like we need each

508
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:07,069
other so artists when they get around

509
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:10,039
scientists record I don't know if you

510
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:12,019
noticed that we recognize all these

511
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:13,819
opportunities for synthesis like oh my

512
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:15,920
god I could I could make something out

513
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:17,299
of this right I could make a project out

514
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,039
of this like what you guys are doing is

515
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:20,329
really interesting to me I don't

516
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,279
understand it but I want to synthesize

517
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:24,980
right that's like the artistic drive

518
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:27,079
whereas you know think about Hans Hawk

519
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,490
or any of these other projects you a

520
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,049
scientist might look at me like oh my

521
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,549
god there's so much data in there right

522
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:33,079
we should draw some of that data out

523
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:34,940
should draw some of that information out

524
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:41,269
and I feel like there is a symbiosis

525
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:42,680
there that we are kind of lacking so you

526
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:45,139
know a prominent and really pertinent

527
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,120
example of this right now you know in

528
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,460
addressing babies the most pressing

529
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,899
issue of our time you know how can

530
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,940
research an intervention through artists

531
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:57,680
literacies be a meaningful component of

532
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:59,750
our response scientists have presented

533
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,340
all the evidence necessary to

534
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,250
demonstrate that this is happening and

535
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:05,750
yet there's no movement or very little

536
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:09,559
movement or it's just painfully

537
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:11,240
painfully slow so it isn't necessarily a

538
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:15,559
question of resources of where the

539
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:18,650
carbon is of what the temperature is but

540
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:20,179
is a question of relationships what is

541
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,009
our relationship to the earth to the

542
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,740
environment what are human beings

543
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:26,500
relationships to one another the earth

544
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,779
will be fine

545
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,000
it will get rid of us if it needs to we

546
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:33,379
won't write what we have to do is we

547
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,809
have to recognize our relationship to

548
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,269
the earth and that's something that can

549
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:38,338
really

550
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:40,138
power artists a lot of artists that I

551
00:23:38,338 --> 00:23:41,969
talk to around this issue feel

552
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:45,358
disempowered because they feel like it's

553
00:23:41,969 --> 00:23:47,609
a scientific issue scientists I talked

554
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:49,138
to feel disempowered because look we put

555
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:50,699
the evidence out there right this is

556
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:52,678
happening we know it's happening but

557
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,909
somehow the relationship to the

558
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,499
information to the knowledge just

559
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:57,570
doesn't seem to actually create a

560
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:59,940
traction so again I feel like this is

561
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:01,229
where this is not one or the other we

562
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:05,369
have to supplement and complement one

563
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:07,048
another's work this is the part of the

564
00:24:05,368 --> 00:24:08,578
talk where artists audio audiences of

565
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:10,679
artists rather start to ask me about

566
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:11,788
instrumentalization and they get my

567
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:16,200
artists don't want to be

568
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:18,200
instrumentalized sometimes it's okay to

569
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:23,308
be instrumentalized because you know we

570
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:26,009
we do we can be tools but also artists

571
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:30,418
have this sense left over from that

572
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:32,069
previous map of our romantic past that

573
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,989
we're a little bit outside of things and

574
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:35,819
that we're a little bit like maybe we're

575
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:38,038
special you know that that it's

576
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:39,778
ineffable things that we do can't be

577
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:41,908
touched that they're innately human and

578
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:44,278
these are important ideas right because

579
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:46,369
everything that we do I don't think can

580
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:49,828
be quantified

581
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:52,108
so are we instrumentalizing or are we

582
00:24:49,828 --> 00:24:55,108
identifying new value in the poetic in

583
00:24:52,108 --> 00:24:58,168
the ineffable and the affective and this

584
00:24:55,108 --> 00:25:02,278
is an important thing to maintain kinds

585
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:04,679
of instrumentalization that you may see

586
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:06,959
in art and again these are not

587
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:10,259
necessarily negative things but these do

588
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:12,778
compartmentalize art right stem to steam

589
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:16,739
I know how familiar you are with the

590
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:20,308
stem to schema movement but it you know

591
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:22,288
it's looking at the the stem emphasis in

592
00:25:20,308 --> 00:25:23,848
especially American high schools and

593
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:28,709
saying well you're leaving out something

594
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:30,628
really important there the little crisis

595
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:32,788
I would say in stem to steam is that

596
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:34,848
nobody actually knows what the a for art

597
00:25:32,788 --> 00:25:37,108
is actually supposed to be doing there

598
00:25:34,848 --> 00:25:39,028
right so it's science technology

599
00:25:37,108 --> 00:25:41,999
engineering and math with egg jammed in

600
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:44,190
there and often what artists get get

601
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:45,569
pigeonholed into doing is the third

602
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:47,759
thing data visualization and

603
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:49,229
communications so you guys gather the

604
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,009
data and you're like can you make us a

605
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:52,650
nice chart or

606
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:55,558
on our website for us and that's like

607
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,419
the only economic value artists feel

608
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:01,950
like they have right is the product of

609
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:03,299
our product of our process activism is

610
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,700
another one there's nothing wrong with

611
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:06,389
activism but it is a

612
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,100
compartmentalization of what artists are

613
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,330
actually capable of right the reason

614
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,668
artists have gotten to the point of

615
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:14,879
activism is because we know things how

616
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:16,980
did we come to learn those things human

617
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,169
centered design and then of course in

618
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:24,500
the contemporary art market which is you

619
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:27,150
know maybe not fully familiar here but a

620
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:30,048
super insidious problem it is the well

621
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,980
farm for the world's richest people

622
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:33,900
there are only two things that actually

623
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,210
generate wealth generate money from

624
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:41,940
nothingness it is contemporary art and

625
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:44,490
real-estate contemporary art is just you

626
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:48,470
know money from thin air it's

627
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:51,000
speculation and it drives economies and

628
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:54,360
artists are caught in this trap of

629
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,220
making work striving to get into a

630
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,769
gallery striving to gain a reputation

631
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,298
striving to become a brand striving to

632
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:02,160
be collected and then you're being

633
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:05,490
collected by frankly the people who are

634
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:08,600
creating some of the most significant

635
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,599
problems in the world right now so

636
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,619
expanding on these instruments

637
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:15,689
instrumentalization x' right is

638
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:18,869
important each of these has to be pushed

639
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:21,360
beyond and that's done by coming back

640
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:24,029
and recognizing that you know it is that

641
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,558
the value that artists ring is not

642
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:27,928
necessarily in the artwork but it is in

643
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:32,308
its process it is in our way of learning

644
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:35,100
in our way of knowing and trying to

645
00:27:32,308 --> 00:27:36,899
figure out how we can value the process

646
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:39,779
of art making the same way we value the

647
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,009
process of science as scientists if you

648
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,990
just tell me that you're gonna spend the

649
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:45,839
next three four five or ten years

650
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:47,579
conducting research nobody has a problem

651
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,069
with that it's totally normal if I do

652
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:51,389
that as an artist that's not

653
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:53,579
economically sustainable and we don't

654
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:57,120
know what research looks like right so

655
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:59,308
as artists we have work to do to educate

656
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,048
ourselves about what our art based

657
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:02,339
research looks like and how do we

658
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:03,599
integrate it with other forms of

659
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:05,308
research so that

660
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:09,748
other researchers can recognize what we

661
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:10,200
do and see the value in it that was

662
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:11,788
quick

663
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,778
there's a lot but now I want to hear

664
00:28:11,788 --> 00:28:20,099
from you take questions you can skip

665
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:22,308
back to any slides but please let me let

666
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,308
me have it

667
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:40,168
[Music]

668
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:42,538
yeah who's a it was really a question

669
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:45,419
right I think you know my understanding

670
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:47,999
of art is that it is it is leaping ahead

671
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:50,249
to synthesis because we don't have a lot

672
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:52,399
of vocabulary for data right we don't

673
00:28:50,249 --> 00:28:56,159
have a lot of vocabulary information

674
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:57,839
whereas I mean I I did a lot of work

675
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,849
with USAID and I've done a lot of work

676
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:03,449
with organizations that rely on

677
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:05,939
scientific data but haven't synthesized

678
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,830
it like we don't know what this means we

679
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:11,489
just have the data and that's a pretty

680
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:12,928
big data approach yeah I think there's a

681
00:29:11,489 --> 00:29:14,519
trend away from that which I'm hopeful

682
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:16,139
for but that's what I need you know it's

683
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:20,608
the sense it's just like is it enough to

684
00:29:16,138 --> 00:29:22,738
just show us a map or a giant set of

685
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:24,628
data you know data points without

686
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:28,470
synthesizing what what is the meaning of

687
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:30,689
it and that often is when scientists and

688
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,220
art to come back to artists if can you

689
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:34,019
help me synthesize this can you help me

690
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,690
visualize it can you help me understand

691
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:39,479
it and I think I think of that we can

692
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:59,369
definitely do and then complement each

693
00:29:39,479 --> 00:30:01,528
other yeah we actually only we did about

694
00:29:59,368 --> 00:30:06,238
a three-day survey it was super quick

695
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:08,579
because I I was sent there for and this

696
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:10,200
is how artists often get a wedge in a

697
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:12,658
foothold in I was sent there to make a

698
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,960
film for US aid about something else in

699
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:17,049
Uganda and I said can I have three extra

700
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,379
days

701
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:22,118
and model this this motive research for

702
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:24,579
a problem that you guys had don't have a

703
00:30:22,118 --> 00:30:26,648
solution for and so they connected me

704
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:28,199
with the African Wildlife Foundation and

705
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:31,628
said sure if you can figure out why

706
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,369
Uganda is seeing rising elephant

707
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:36,128
populations the elephant population in

708
00:30:33,368 --> 00:30:38,230
Uganda has skyrocketed since the civil

709
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:39,368
war there meanwhile in Tanzania it is

710
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:44,349
continuing to plummet they're still

711
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:46,118
poaching and and yet the interventions

712
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:47,498
like the government interventions and

713
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:50,048
the community interventions are kind of

714
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:52,659
the same so something's happening in

715
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:54,429
Uganda that's not happening Tanzania so

716
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:56,470
we didn't get to do a comparative study

717
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:59,528
in Tanzania we did a kind of preliminary

718
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:02,108
study you know on a few days of just

719
00:30:59,528 --> 00:31:03,548
talking with Rangers observing them

720
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:05,949
following them through their work

721
00:31:03,548 --> 00:31:08,739
processes and then coding the footage

722
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:12,460
evaluating the footage my narrative lens

723
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:14,528
and again I didn't know what they didn't

724
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,538
know so I just gave them a report back

725
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:18,429
and said you know things that's amazing

726
00:31:16,538 --> 00:31:21,308
about these Rangers is that they're

727
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:25,960
really patriotic they come from all over

728
00:31:21,308 --> 00:31:30,099
Uganda and when they join the you got a

729
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:32,350
wildlife Authority that's like joining

730
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:34,949
the military in the United States right

731
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:37,019
so they describe their patriotism right

732
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:40,409
defending their natural resources

733
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:43,480
protecting their country's identity and

734
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:46,028
I was like that you know we're kind of

735
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:55,329
like oh that's cool like that's a great

736
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:58,599
thing and the UWA and the awf based in

737
00:31:55,329 --> 00:32:00,368
the u.s. not the why life Preservation

738
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:02,469
Society but the other organization that

739
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:04,329
we were working for had never heard of

740
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,879
this they didn't know they didn't

741
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:08,918
realize patriotism was important so in

742
00:32:06,878 --> 00:32:10,658
Uganda right I mean people are coming

743
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:12,700
from their their villages and from their

744
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:15,399
communities and there is no there's a

745
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:18,480
lot of kind of like kind of fractured

746
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:21,038
national identity and come they were

747
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,128
uniting around Uganda's Natural

748
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,690
Resources its wildlife and suddenly they

749
00:32:24,128 --> 00:32:27,339
realized oh this is a way we can recruit

750
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,180
Rangers right

751
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:29,379
and that's one of the biggest things

752
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,789
they just need them Rangers they just

753
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,270
need more people who are out there

754
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:36,129
protecting the animals and recruitment

755
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:38,109
is an issue and they said well we should

756
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:39,940
recruit on patriotism we should recruit

757
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:42,099
do it for Uganda alright the way that we

758
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,840
recruit soldiers right it's it's you see

759
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:45,969
everywhere I mean you know there's so

760
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:48,399
much kind of militarism in America so

761
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:51,220
much patriotism the unites us as a

762
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,480
country Uganda has found that you can

763
00:32:51,220 --> 00:33:11,529
unite themselves the country around

764
00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:13,990
defending their there why are they also

765
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:19,349
anything that you could like to those

766
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:19,349
who want to visually in the terms of me

767
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,920
but like which is a little easier when

768
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,889
you understand those but like for people

769
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:33,039
I know that sound like there's

770
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:35,440
differences unless you do it yeah doing

771
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,700
it is the best way to do it right at

772
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,850
doing it is the best way to learn you

773
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,529
you develop literacy by trying to read

774
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:46,359
so you develop visual literacy by trying

775
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:47,589
to look and but that that key question I

776
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,419
would keep coming back to is what do you

777
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:50,619
know and how do you know it so when you

778
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,130
look at an image when you look at a

779
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:52,689
moving image

780
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:56,410
ask yourself like what do I know about

781
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:59,410
this image and then where did that

782
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:02,710
knowledge come from right I mean if I

783
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:07,660
see you know just skip quickly to a

784
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:09,490
slide like this all right you can look

785
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,289
at a slide like that and be like alright

786
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:13,299
it's three people sitting in a row but

787
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:15,250
what do I know about it okay I know

788
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,050
there's an authority figure right

789
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,668
I can recognize age difference I can

790
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,289
recognize some sort of context it's the

791
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:22,719
institutional context we can tell that

792
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:24,909
by the lighting we look at people's

793
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,079
facial expressions like here's how I

794
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:27,610
know what's happening in this scene

795
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,559
right this is the story that's unfolding

796
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:32,200
and then when you when you basically

797
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:34,989
split this up into categories of

798
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:38,049
knowledge alright so now I know how to

799
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:39,949
make an image that can tell the story I

800
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,950
want to tell

801
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:45,949
I mean the you know the the biggest kind

802
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:47,359
of failure in visual literacy that you

803
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,799
that you would see and when you see a

804
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,510
film it's like well that didn't make any

805
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,430
sense right because the audience

806
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:56,390
interpreted it one way and the

807
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:58,849
filmmakers intended it another and so

808
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:00,289
that's just a part of you know using the

809
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:02,659
wrong image right using the wrong shot

810
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:05,480
using the right angle and recognizing as

811
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:08,569
you would that every single detail

812
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,849
matters what is the camera angle what is

813
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,559
the lighting how clear is the sound all

814
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:25,489
of those things are components in our

815
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:26,840
understanding that's a great question

816
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:28,789
the ideal relationship you know artists

817
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,230
and scientists this is what we're

818
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:34,159
talking about this morning it's

819
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:35,539
adjacency I think it's just you know

820
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,909
there's a school science and there's a

821
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:39,920
school of art and how often do you see

822
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:41,569
each other alright how often do you just

823
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:47,510
sit next to each other and just kind of

824
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:49,730
you know cross pollinate partly those

825
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:53,480
artists and the scientists have to be

826
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:55,070
kind of armed with an openness when you

827
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,530
look at an artwork to say like hey this

828
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,120
is full of data which would be great

829
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,980
and an artist if you think there is it

830
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,019
is great what is it what is the data

831
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,699
help me right and so that's the

832
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:06,590
adjacency right so there should be

833
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:07,879
artists studios right there and they

834
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,260
should be there it should be a

835
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,660
playground in a sandbox that's where our

836
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:14,360
studios are right it's just we just play

837
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:15,500
and test and experiment and then you can

838
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,510
walk in and be like hey what are you up

839
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,190
to

840
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:20,690
that's it so it doesn't I don't know so

841
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:22,849
this is where I don't we don't need to

842
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,340
instrumentalize artists and have them

843
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:26,719
embedded as residents and do science cuz

844
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,230
no we're not gonna be good at the Hat

845
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:33,289
right but we could just be there and you

846
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:35,269
can see in our work what you see and we

847
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:43,789
can see in your work what we see and we

848
00:36:35,269 --> 00:36:47,150
can work together every studio is

849
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:49,909
renaming itself a lab now yeah because

850
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:52,250
exactly for this reason I think you know

851
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:52,969
a lab has a scent I think there's a

852
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,909
technology

853
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:58,759
overtone to a lab right that where that

854
00:36:55,909 --> 00:37:01,219
isn't in a studio and as artists start

855
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,430
to adopt technologies their Studios

856
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:06,588
become labs in terms of places for

857
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:09,699
experimentation play testing and

858
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:18,529
observation I feel like they're the same

859
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:19,098
dude we need a sign that's a good

860
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,599
question

861
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:26,088
what do you know and how do you know it

862
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:27,349
I think I mean I think that science I'm

863
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:29,409
gonna totally put my foot in my mouth

864
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:32,240
here I just yeah

865
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:34,460
my understanding of science is that it's

866
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,858
a much more kind of structured way of

867
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:39,800
learning right there are steps in the

868
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:42,078
process and there is peer review and

869
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,250
there's kind of mutual recognition of

870
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,460
what's good science and what's bad

871
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:48,769
science it doesn't always work you know

872
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:51,220
and I think that's sometimes it comes

873
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:54,858
down to the tools sometimes the people

874
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:59,838
but I think that where science literacy

875
00:37:54,858 --> 00:38:03,409
is would be valuable is is understanding

876
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:06,230
also the human presence in science right

877
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:08,539
what again it everyone in this room is

878
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:10,608
full of implicit biases and and

879
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:12,259
structural prejudices that are not

880
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:15,049
necessarily bad things they are just

881
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:17,300
present all right I'm a white man born

882
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:19,550
and raised in the United States that

883
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,039
that is a loaded thing to be right and

884
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:23,930
there is a lot in there that as you kind

885
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:25,608
of work through it and grow through it

886
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:27,649
and recognize those biases you like oh

887
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:29,659
my gosh I haven't made a free choice in

888
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:31,670
my life you know it's like we aren't

889
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:33,230
really free of those things and so I

890
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,700
think for scientists that's a huge

891
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:36,260
challenge because you're trying to

892
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:38,989
create this objective view of the world

893
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:42,589
and just see it for its data points but

894
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:45,259
it's so hard to see data points outside

895
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:48,619
of our own head you know and and I don't

896
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:50,839
I don't necessarily buy into objectivity

897
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:53,750
so much as what I call multiple

898
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:58,578
subjectivity we need we need multiple

899
00:38:53,750 --> 00:39:02,300
truths right to inform a common common

900
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:04,190
reality yeah well it's your become the

901
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:07,460
relation

902
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:10,490
illiteracy luzie of the Archon Titans

903
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:13,539
were like philosophy and the this

904
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:19,209
technology which would like question

905
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:21,680
projected yeah it's related I you know

906
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:23,838
this question that I that I keep coming

907
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,699
back to of what do you know and how do

908
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:30,259
you know it you know is his philosophy

909
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:33,199
is histology and I'm also not a

910
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:36,799
philosopher right so I couldn't tell you

911
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:39,848
who got there first or the history of it

912
00:39:36,798 --> 00:39:42,548
it comes more from this recognition that

913
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:47,990
so much of what we're trying to do as

914
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:50,119
people is is based on a faith in

915
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:51,500
objectivity right a belief that there is

916
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:53,119
like something happening outside of

917
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,199
ourselves and of course there is

918
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,769
something happening outside ourselves

919
00:39:54,199 --> 00:40:00,230
but how do we access it from within

920
00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:02,719
ourselves and I think that's the

921
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:06,019
interesting place that artists actually

922
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,909
have you know can play a role art

923
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:09,829
certainly in the West has been looking

924
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:12,170
inward you know for the last few hundred

925
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:13,640
years it's become very reflective right

926
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:17,450
and very kind of inward looking and I

927
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:19,909
think that was the romantic reaction to

928
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:22,308
science looking outward and analyzing it

929
00:40:19,909 --> 00:40:23,960
and breaking it apart and you know this

930
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:26,539
is again what kind of to our

931
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,338
conversation this morning we we do have

932
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:31,880
it's I think we can come back together

933
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:34,788
in some sense the challenge of that is

934
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:37,750
specialization right science is so

935
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:41,720
complex that you can't also be artists

936
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:45,349
full-blown artists at the same time so

937
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:47,328
we can work together right I also I it's

938
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:49,160
too late for me to become a full-blown

939
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:51,380
scientist right because there's so much

940
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:53,480
to learn there's so much history there's

941
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,730
so much involvement so my my

942
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,380
understanding of it is that we we should

943
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,608
have a philosopher in the room we should

944
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,369
have an artist in the room we should

945
00:40:58,608 --> 00:41:03,409
have scientists in the room and we all

946
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:05,660
have to then train ourselves into an

947
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:11,639
openness that our specialties have I

948
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:14,288
think trained us away from this desire

949
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:18,668
adjacencies were being near each other

950
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:20,919
and that also cut I did a studio

951
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:24,668
becoming a lab but but what about that

952
00:41:20,918 --> 00:41:25,868
screaming to get shared facilities like

953
00:41:24,668 --> 00:41:28,748
if I'm thinking of the things that we do

954
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:29,679
we visualize a scientist we have special

955
00:41:28,748 --> 00:41:31,708
techniques of looking at some

956
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:33,548
microscopes

957
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:35,408
different ways of seeing things and

958
00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:37,449
scales that aren't that help us and then

959
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:39,369
we have ways of presenting some

960
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:41,459
visualization and I feel like we don't

961
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:44,919
and then we well create stuff well

962
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:48,998
becomes negotiating met incurring what

963
00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:50,679
is the question being able to make stuff

964
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:52,478
you know like when you share an ability

965
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:54,338
to use the same you know whatever it

966
00:41:52,478 --> 00:42:01,328
could be internal it you know laser

967
00:41:54,338 --> 00:42:03,278
cutter or like you know is it beyond the

968
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:06,609
Jason see into like shared usually did

969
00:42:03,278 --> 00:42:13,329
so that actually yeah you're working at

970
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:14,889
the same EB out with the same yeah so

971
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:17,079
one of the one of the implications of

972
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:20,078
the narrative research the film based

973
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:22,298
research that I came upon almost right

974
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,759
away was that the tools are insufficient

975
00:42:22,298 --> 00:42:27,548
all right all the tools that I use for

976
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:30,639
filmmaking are made from making films

977
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:32,858
that I put out into the world as like

978
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,498
linear pieces of media and then there's

979
00:42:32,858 --> 00:42:37,630
nonlinear media like algorithmic editors

980
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:39,668
that you can put on on the web but

981
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:42,160
they're all product based right it's all

982
00:42:39,668 --> 00:42:43,389
about making a product and publishing it

983
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,068
so the first thing I started to think

984
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:47,318
about slyguy we need new tools for

985
00:42:45,068 --> 00:42:49,119
filmmakers and then I started to imagine

986
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:50,710
every artist he's gonna come come up

987
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,229
against this if they complete they

988
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:55,509
reframe their practice as not art making

989
00:42:53,228 --> 00:42:58,328
but as knowledge production they're

990
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:59,889
gonna need new tools scientists mate you

991
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:04,619
may already have those tools the thing

992
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:06,699
is I don't know or I know I need I need

993
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:09,430
technologists to help me build those

994
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:10,838
tools so again it's you know the

995
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:12,308
technologists are kind of serving a

996
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:15,038
market and the market tells them that

997
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:17,619
they need Adobe Premiere to cut yeah to

998
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:19,569
cut a feature film I need a thing that

999
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:21,548
makes this kind of map for me I need to

1000
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:22,630
be able to kind of code things so some

1001
00:43:21,548 --> 00:43:24,548
of this stuff is actually based on

1002
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:26,019
social scientists tools right the

1003
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:28,798
concept of coding is a social science

1004
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:31,508
concept and there are social science

1005
00:43:28,798 --> 00:43:35,440
pieces of software that let me kind of

1006
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:38,130
code text and highlight images so I can

1007
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,420
see in that like the beginning of like

1008
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:43,660
coming into a science lab and be like oh

1009
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:46,389
I could use this right artists are all

1010
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:47,858
about repurposing things so I could

1011
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:49,989
repurpose some of the tools that you're

1012
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:52,119
using or maybe if we're adjacent to each

1013
00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:56,259
other we recognize that you need tools

1014
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:58,660
that artists have used and maybe we need

1015
00:43:56,259 --> 00:44:01,630
hybrid tools I think that's like a third

1016
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:04,719
component that is you know kind of to be

1017
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:06,579
determined is is if we created these

1018
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,440
kind of interdisciplinary like really

1019
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:10,059
collaborative open sort of spaces I

1020
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,798
think one of the first things that will

1021
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:34,150
emerge from them are an entirely new

1022
00:44:11,798 --> 00:44:40,329
family of tools putting different

1023
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:43,450
programs as well and I'm here for me is

1024
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:46,509
like I'm not probably what you'll do

1025
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:48,548
market at market oh I'm just like this

1026
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:51,478
in-between residency's and there is a

1027
00:44:48,548 --> 00:44:55,108
lot of sensors that are on this kind of

1028
00:44:51,478 --> 00:44:55,108
research whatever

1029
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:07,039
[Music]

1030
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:11,210
and then you get business your way that

1031
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:14,980
is very specific and I think this is and

1032
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:17,990
we don't have the net as you say is that

1033
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:20,929
to share this which is not the piece

1034
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:26,750
it's not the time you are sharing they I

1035
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:29,269
mean everyday life what do you do from

1036
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:31,699
that that's really my question now today

1037
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:35,780
so and that's a great question so artist

1038
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:39,739
residency is especially the United

1039
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:41,240
States are problematic right because so

1040
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:44,299
if I get a year-long artist residency

1041
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:46,159
right now in like in New York City there

1042
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,240
are public artists and residences which

1043
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:49,549
this is like the most progressive

1044
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:52,069
program in the country where you can

1045
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,970
spend a year in any city agency as an

1046
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:58,870
artisan residence

1047
00:45:52,969 --> 00:46:01,118
you get like $5,000 and a cubicle right

1048
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:02,920
if I must

1049
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,930
scientist in residence if I'm a

1050
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,730
demographer right in the demographics

1051
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:10,509
office or if I'm you know Social

1052
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:14,498
Sciences you're gonna get a salary yeah

1053
00:46:10,509 --> 00:46:17,710
yeah yeah so so part of it is that so on

1054
00:46:14,498 --> 00:46:19,989
the one hand it's like um artists have I

1055
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:23,499
mean you know we can kind of tame it

1056
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:24,548
into accepting that as okay and part of

1057
00:46:23,498 --> 00:46:27,939
that is because we aren't really sure

1058
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:29,259
what our value is like I'm gonna go in

1059
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,639
there and every artist so I work

1060
00:46:29,259 --> 00:46:34,329
specifically with artists in residence

1061
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:35,078
so that so I'm their impact producer

1062
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:38,048
okay

1063
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:40,630
I do the coding on their audience texts

1064
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:42,998
on their process texts on a producer

1065
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:44,440
text and on their artwork and like draw

1066
00:46:42,998 --> 00:46:46,449
the data out of it and the artist is

1067
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:49,420
like oh wow I never saw I never knew all

1068
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:51,848
this that was happening and and then we

1069
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,950
have to shape it to that agency or that

1070
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:55,720
organization maybe they want to report

1071
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:58,629
back right everybody wants a deliverable

1072
00:46:55,719 --> 00:47:00,669
right so that that the deliverable of an

1073
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:03,278
artist residency tends to be like

1074
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:06,579
decorations on the wall like feel-good

1075
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:08,259
events and positive PR okay we're not a

1076
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:12,818
big evil bureaucracy we have an

1077
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:15,548
artist-in-residence so but if that

1078
00:47:12,818 --> 00:47:17,889
artisan residence was producing data was

1079
00:47:15,548 --> 00:47:20,528
producing knowledge right whether in the

1080
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:23,379
form of reports or artworks standalone

1081
00:47:20,528 --> 00:47:25,509
art works on their own knowledge in an

1082
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:28,960
audience right experience with the

1083
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:31,329
public that's really economically

1084
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,499
valuable that artists could do that

1085
00:47:31,329 --> 00:47:35,109
full-time and they could do it for a

1086
00:47:32,498 --> 00:47:38,618
salary that would change our culture if

1087
00:47:35,108 --> 00:47:42,190
artists were not in a state of economic

1088
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:43,778
desperation where we are all best

1089
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,429
friends until we have to stab each other

1090
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,748
in the back to get the gallery show and

1091
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:48,669
then nobody likes you anymore but now

1092
00:47:46,748 --> 00:47:51,009
you're collected by you know an oil

1093
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:52,599
tycoon that's the reality artists face

1094
00:47:51,009 --> 00:47:55,028
and that's where art schools are

1095
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:56,829
pointing them right because that's like

1096
00:47:55,028 --> 00:47:58,480
Career Services is how do you get a

1097
00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:00,640
gallery show you know how do you enter

1098
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:04,630
the market instead of what do you do at

1099
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:08,409
a residency to prove your worth and to

1100
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:09,849
to transform that that agency right or

1101
00:48:08,409 --> 00:48:11,969
that organization wherever the residency

1102
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:11,970
is

1103
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:52,690
I just don't want to claim I know it

1104
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:54,820
because I don't firsthand I've heard it

1105
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:58,619
I've heard that you know before and I

1106
00:48:54,820 --> 00:49:01,059
just think ultimately we ultimately

1107
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:03,639
capitalism is gonna insist that we have

1108
00:49:01,059 --> 00:49:06,429
deliverables right and you know

1109
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:09,690
scientist it's a career with papers or

1110
00:49:06,429 --> 00:49:12,639
artists it's a career in a gallery and

1111
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:16,570
but the thing that unifies us is that

1112
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:18,849
all we want to do is learn right and and

1113
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:22,269
build and build a body of knowledge that

1114
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:26,769
we can pass on right we need an economy

1115
00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:34,239
that values that for both of us thank

1116
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:37,509
you so much this has been a production
