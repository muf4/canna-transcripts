1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,039
University so um yeah so it's a pretty

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,679
broad topic and um we're I'm going to

4
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,118
present a piece of it that we've been

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,079
working on and by we I mean there's been

6
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:23,039
a group of us and it really is a group

7
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:25,919
effort and that's myself Liz Carter

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,880
Susan Ria and Steve Shaw with input from

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,000
Peter

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,320
Woodburry and um I should say that there

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,640
several groups around the world that are

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,079
that are really doing great work in in

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,239
this area we had a seminar a couple

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,320
weeks ago from a person from Australia

15
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:45,119
Scott Chapman who uh is with csro and

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,159
he's U associated with a group at

17
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:51,959
University of queens and that is really

18
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:55,159
doing great work on um on uh uh trying

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,160
to um uh help uh agricultural producers

20
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:00,799
in Australia deal with impacts of

21
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:03,399
climate and that's important there

22
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:07,039
and uh

23
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:09,920
so so why maze why climate impacts and

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,560
how do we get involved so the kind of

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,000
global answer to the first question is

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,240
ma is a big crop it's the leading Cal

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,438
crop in the world demand supposed to

28
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:24,399
increase by 50% over the next 50 or or

29
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,359
75 years and over that time temperatures

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,118
are supposed to be increasing by at

31
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:32,599
least two or three degrees C potentially

32
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:35,560
so that's kind of the overarching reason

33
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:37,599
uh and why climate impacts because we're

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,840
expecting these increases in in

35
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:43,199
temperature and and we don't potentially

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,359
changes in

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,600
precipitation there's been a number of

38
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,640
papers over the past 10 years primarily

39
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,839
from folks who are not uh their primary

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,359
U area is not

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,520
agriculture where they have done yield

42
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,118
projections using statistical modeling

43
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,438
and they've really they've suggested

44
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,920
pretty severe impacts of increasing

45
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:07,679
temperatures on May's productivity both

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,520
historically but also in particular into

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,480
the

48
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,640
future several years ago Susan and Steve

49
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,359
kind of looked into this and and had

50
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,518
some questions about the methodologies

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,800
and results and that led to a paper

52
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,200
where they did some initial work on

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,519
looking at irrigated maze production to

54
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,439
see whether they could detect a

55
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,200
temperature impact on on irrigated Maze

56
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,639
and they were unable to in the in the

57
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:36,318
they looked at but that led to a hatch

58
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,158
proposal that that was funded and

59
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:42,079
allowed us to look

60
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:45,079
more in you know intensively at at the

61
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,840
impact of climate on maze with

62
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,080
particular emphasis on temperature but

63
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,319
it it kind of evolved into additional in

64
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,239
additional

65
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,079
impacts so I'm just going to try to go

66
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,800
through some of the kind of climate

67
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,480
impacts on maze uh maze yields so so the

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,200
the cap on yields is solar radiation so

69
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,199
I don't have that here but that any

70
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,798
given location for any given soils is

71
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,479
going to be solar radiation but the next

72
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,920
most important impact despite all the

73
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,759
emphasis on temperature actually is

74
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,518
precipitation I think every most

75
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:20,719
agronomist and crop physiologists would

76
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,439
agree that that's the main limitation

77
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,560
climate limitation on on maze production

78
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,158
so I got this quote from Tom Sinclair

79
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,719
the thousand pound gorilla and crop

80
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:30,679
response to climate change he's

81
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,598
referring to precipitation

82
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,640
that's partly because maybe to emphasize

83
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:39,119
that you know it's it's precipitation

84
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,559
more than the the more recent emphasis

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,120
on temperature but also the fact that we

86
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,039
don't projections of precipitation are

87
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,080
really uncertain so we really don't know

88
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,878
what's going to happen that's going to

89
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,959
have a Major Impact but there are direct

90
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:55,878
temperature impacts on Maze and probably

91
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,199
the most well documented is on phology

92
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:01,359
that means higher temperatures

93
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,878
accelerated rate develop M reduced

94
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,319
cumulative um intercepted radiation in

95
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:09,399
lower yields and that's been that's been

96
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,039
pretty well documented there also are

97
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,840
physiological

98
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:17,439
impacts um reduced pollen viability uh

99
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,280
loss of membrane

100
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,240
Integrity uh inactivation of of some

101
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,758
heat sensitive enzymes particularly in

102
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,199
photosynthesis and in um starch

103
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,479
synthesis um and uh increased

104
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,319
respiration

105
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:36,680
but those you know at the temperature

106
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,719
it's 38 to 40° C um and keep that in

107
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,199
mind because we'll be getting coming

108
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,600
back to that in a bit there are what

109
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,360
have been proposed these indirect

110
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,800
temperature impacts and primarily that's

111
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,000
that there's going to be an increase in

112
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,800
evaporative demand it's going to cause

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,279
more frequent um bouts of water stress

114
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,918
in Maze and reduce yields I'm going to

115
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,159
actually spend a fair amount of time on

116
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:01,719
that and I'll I'll get like I'll get

117
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,320
back to that in a bit there are

118
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,080
complications and that's these

119
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:07,519
interactions for climate the intera the

120
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,800
problem is is

121
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:13,000
that high temperature drought higher

122
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,038
high evaporative demand are all highly

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,918
correlated they often they at least in

124
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:20,918
the US Corn Belt they they occur all at

125
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,399
the same time so it becomes very

126
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:24,079
difficult then to isolate which are the

127
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,478
factors that are most responsible for

128
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:30,318
impacts on yield and that's something

129
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:33,800
that um Liz has been wrestling with

130
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,319
quite a bit recently the second thing

131
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,879
and I'm not going to really talk about

132
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:41,680
this but it's I I think pretty important

133
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:45,759
is there's not really clear information

134
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,720
on when maze is underw

135
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:52,560
stress how will higher

136
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,960
temperatures impact yield in other words

137
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,879
is what kind of interaction is there

138
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,680
when the crop is already in stress from

139
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,079
one say say drought how how will then

140
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,120
elevated temperatures imp have an what

141
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:08,758
additional impact will they have and

142
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,598
that's it's something that there's not a

143
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,400
lot of literature on and the literature

144
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:15,360
that's there is not real clear on that

145
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,399
but it's important because it'll it'll

146
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,199
it'll give information on what are the

147
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:24,560
impacts on the thresholds for damage

148
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,560
from say temperature or or water

149
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:31,038
stress so just to kind of do a very

150
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,720
simple very brief kind of overview of my

151
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,199
sense of the literature on the more

152
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,280
recent literature that I mentioned on

153
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,520
statistical modeling is there was first

154
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:43,478
an early focus on temperature and this

155
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:45,879
was to the to in precipitation or or

156
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:48,318
drought was considered secondary in this

157
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,240
in these studies and they reported

158
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,840
pretty significant impacts both

159
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,120
historically and in in projected into

160
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:57,918
the future as I mentioned but not the

161
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,959
thresholds that they were using to where

162
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,079
they expected damage to occur reduced

163
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,279
heals was around 30° C that's in

164
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,000
contrast to the to what we saw before

165
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,638
for the physiological

166
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,759
damage more recently they I think as

167
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,319
they become became associated with more

168
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:19,240
um agriculturally oriented people let's

169
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:21,800
say uh they shifted their emphasis to

170
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,560
that the impact of higher temperatures

171
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,598
climate change was going to be by

172
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,759
increasing evapor demand as I mentioned

173
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,478
before and this this is something where

174
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,160
again they're project ing pretty

175
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,038
significant impacts and this is I'm

176
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,520
going to try to get to this and explain

177
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,959
it a little bit better and I hope I'll

178
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,519
be able to do that uh because we have

179
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,918
some serious we have some questions

180
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,758
about

181
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:48,000
that also in these more recent kind of

182
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,800
statistical studies they've understood

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,439
that there's acclamation that occurs in

184
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,840
maze to high temperatures that could

185
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,598
modify or mitigate the impact of

186
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,439
temperature there's also one has to

187
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,839
account for genetics management soil

188
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:05,918
factors and that there are impacts by

189
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:07,638
grow stage these genetic management soil

190
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,279
factors are really important because

191
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,478
they not only impact yield independently

192
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:17,158
of climate but they interact with

193
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:19,519
climate to to um uh to um affect maze

194
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:21,279
yields and another quote from Sinclair

195
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,598
which I thought was quite good is right

196
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,359
here temperature increase imposed on

197
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,439
current crop systems without management

198
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,280
or genetic changes is often predicted to

199
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,120
decrease yields but is highly likely

200
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,478
that cropping systems will remain static

201
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
and I think I'll be able to show

202
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:42,759
some it's often predicted but it's

203
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,278
highly

204
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:47,720
well he was saying that there they'll

205
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,639
remain static the deals won't be

206
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,160
affected the the temperature they're

207
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,879
projecting decreases actually it's a

208
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,120
good I'm glad you brought that up Peter

209
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:00,278
because actually we can I think we can

210
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,600
show at least in some of our data that

211
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:06,480
management can actually increase yields

212
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,480
even with increases in

213
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
temperature so these are I'm just going

214
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:15,838
to go through a series of

215
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,839
questions uh and um to try to address

216
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,800
this and uh the climate impacts and and

217
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,079
this one on the

218
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,599
vpds I just wanted to say right now

219
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:31,719
there's two aspects to this impact of of

220
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,879
VPD on on on on yields or uh increase of

221
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,759
Apper demand one is whether there

222
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,799
actually will be an increase into the

223
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:42,720
future in the US corn Bel and the second

224
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:45,399
is how if there is what is the

225
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,160
interaction between BPD and the

226
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,639
processes of interest that would be EV

227
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,559
APPA transpiration and carbon

228
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,120
assimilation and Maze so I'm going to

229
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:57,039
try to get to that and hopefully it will

230
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,879
be a little clear um so this first

231
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:04,719
question we address by

232
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:08,320
um uh using statistical modeling uh of

233
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,480
both irrigated and rainfed Maze uh

234
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,640
yields and I'll get to that in just a

235
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,519
second that's work that Liz has been uh

236
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:18,919
primarily involved with and in fact gave

237
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:23,200
a seminar last uh spring on the

238
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:25,159
irrigated component of that um so the

239
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,360
advantage we had here is we had access

240
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:30,199
to a a data set from the National Corn

241
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,879
Growers Association uh uh for both

242
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,759
irrigated and rainfed uh uh categories

243
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,240
or

244
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:40,879
classes um this was from 2005 to

245
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,680
2012 it was focused mainly in the

246
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,639
western corn Bel but in the rainfed we

247
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,679
included Iowa also we have other

248
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:51,360
additional States we haven't started the

249
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,679
analyses on those this is under um so

250
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,278
the advantage is it's optimal management

251
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,199
so the limitations on yield are going to

252
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,000
be due to whatever the local factors

253
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,560
like soils might

254
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,240
but other than that it's going to be a

255
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,239
climate impact and that's what we were

256
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,839
really trying to um get at was what is

257
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,120
the impact of climate there were a large

258
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:15,600
number of of values uh yield data that

259
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,278
we had and then we had the real nice

260
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
thing is we had all this additional

261
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,159
information so this is both management

262
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,278
and genetics information that was really

263
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:28,199
quite useful and and trying to explain U

264
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,919
the impacts on on um maze yields both in

265
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,800
the irrigated and in the rainfed uh data

266
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:36,838
sets and those were used to define

267
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:39,879
growth stages that were used um that

268
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,760
were used to um both look at seasonal

269
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,159
impacts but also impacts by grow stage

270
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:47,200
again Liz

271
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:51,360
gave gave a seminar on the irrigated

272
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,360
part of this um work and the the main

273
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,560
findings there is that there was

274
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,240
evidence for

275
00:11:54,559 --> 00:12:00,278
acclamation there was no impacts of

276
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,039
temperature with even in 2012 when we

277
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:08,200
had near record or record temperatures

278
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:12,519
across the the US corn Bel um there was

279
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,759
uh also evidence that by agronomically

280
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,519
realistic adjustments of management you

281
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,240
could actually increase yields so there

282
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:24,879
was room for for actually improved

283
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:28,440
yields in the irrigated uh uh maze in uh

284
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,879
in in the cornbelt so so I'm not going

285
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,440
to so that's all I'm going to talk about

286
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:36,679
for the irrigated again because that was

287
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,320
been presented and actually that uh uh

288
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:41,958
work has been submitted and for public

289
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:47,920
for Publications under review right

290
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:49,958
now so this uh is um kind of a summary

291
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,519
of the precipitation and grain yals over

292
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:56,319
time for for the rainfed and and just

293
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,240
for uh to contrast I have the irrigated

294
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,440
here so the main

295
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,680
main thing to note with the

296
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,880
precipitation is you know pretty steady

297
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:12,198
but 2012 was a very very low precept

298
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:13,759
year um by mid June or so prip shut down

299
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:17,159
and there was very little after that

300
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,799
particularly in in uh in the western

301
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,559
corn

302
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:25,439
Bel um this was associated with very

303
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:28,319
high temperatures and very high uh vpds

304
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,680
I'll I'll explain a bit more about that

305
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,160
no impact on irrigated yields like I

306
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:36,239
just mentioned in fact 2012 was the

307
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:40,198
highest yield uh uh highest yielding

308
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,240
year um uh uh of the period that we

309
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:43,639
looked at and this period included I

310
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,560
should I didn't show the temperature

311
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,959
data but this period included quite a

312
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,758
broad range of temperatures so both

313
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:52,599
higher and

314
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:55,240
lower the rainfed yields are here so

315
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,040
you'll know I think anybody who's aware

316
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,480
kind of somewhat aware of of grain

317
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,198
yields will note that they're pretty

318
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,639
high

319
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:03,758
so you get it's important to keep in

320
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,440
mind this is a yield contest so these

321
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,720
Growers are selecting their best sites

322
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,600
so even

323
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:15,320
where there may be it's you know a

324
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,399
precipitation it may be getting to the

325
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,600
edge of the of the of the kind of

326
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,720
rainfed production agriculture they're

327
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,879
still selecting very very their their

328
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,199
best sites

329
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:29,278
so uh there's going to it's going to

330
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,120
maybe shift the yields a little bit

331
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,078
higher than what they would be normally

332
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,480
but in 2012 there was a reduction and

333
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:39,278
this reduction the percentage reduction

334
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,120
in yields in these yield contest data is

335
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,919
pretty much the same as what the overall

336
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,759
reduction in yields were in the midwest

337
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:51,319
in 2012 that's reported in the National

338
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:53,639
agricultural statistics so even though

339
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,320
the the absolute values are higher the

340
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,039
magnitude of reduction 2012 was was

341
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,560
about the same and I'm going to focus on

342
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:04,319
2012 because of the uh the climate

343
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:07,479
extremes that that occurred in that

344
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,160
year so this is kind of some summary

345
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,959
data and most of what I'm going to show

346
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,799
is descriptive because we're still in

347
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,439
the

348
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:18,159
preliminary part of um of this these

349
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,360
analyses the top panel is grain yield as

350
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,120
a function of vapor pressure deficit

351
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,079
this is for rainfed for Kansas Missouri

352
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,959
and

353
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:30,479
Nebraska so you note that there is does

354
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:33,919
appear to be a Rel relationship where

355
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,959
whereby at higher vpds you do get lower

356
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,879
yields important to keep in mind though

357
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,318
that the there's a there's correlations

358
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,759
among the climate variables here and

359
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:46,639
we'll get to that so you so it's not a

360
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,600
maybe so much of a surprise that the

361
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,440
statistical modeling that's been done

362
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,319
might show that BPD is a factor in

363
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,800
impacting ma Fields but I think what

364
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:59,799
we'll try to show is that it's much more

365
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,599
complicated than that we look at Iowa

366
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,679
Iowa is interesting the rainfed data

367
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,278
same thing grainfield as a function of

368
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:10,198
vapor pressure deficit there was really

369
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:13,198
no no impact partly because the climate

370
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:17,198
was not as severely impacted in 2012 as

371
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:19,679
it was in in uh in the western corn Bel

372
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,399
so we never got the really high bpds low

373
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:25,719
pre as low prip and as high

374
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,919
temperatures this is the irrigated as a

375
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,319
as a comparison

376
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,838
um shows that when you eliminate water

377
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:37,278
stress there's no impact of vapor

378
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,079
pressure deficit or high temperature on

379
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:42,519
yields so getting to this correlation

380
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:45,679
that I've been mentioning so this is

381
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,600
this is the kind of uh combined data

382
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:51,758
from for all the the yield data for the

383
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,800
rainfed from 2005 to 2012 showing the

384
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,120
season average

385
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,758
TX as a function of season average vapor

386
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,759
pressure deficit and you Can See Clearly

387
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,600
there's a relationship the higher the

388
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,000
temperature the higher the vapor

389
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,759
pressure deficit there's a color code

390
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,798
here for precept for June July and

391
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:14,919
August total precept you'll note

392
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:17,439
that the higher precepts are in at the

393
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,759
lower vpds lower temperatures as you get

394
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,640
to these higher

395
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:25,480
values uh you that's where the lower

396
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,280
precipitation uh is occurring so again

397
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,960
important to keep you know this this is

398
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,359
important to note so it makes it more

399
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,120
difficult to identify these drivers this

400
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:37,199
is another way of looking at where we

401
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,678
plotted grain yield as a function of

402
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,919
growing season

403
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,200
precipitation where we color coded for

404
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,640
vapor pressure deficit here so darker

405
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,600
colors are higher vapor pressure

406
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,559
deficits so you note up until about down

407
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,439
to about 300 millimeters of of June July

408
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,000
August

409
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,640
precept yields are scattered but they're

410
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,919
not but they're all fairly high but

411
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,960
about 300 and lower you get quite a

412
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,720
range of yields and you start getting

413
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,679
some very low yields these are in

414
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,759
particular where the very highest vapor

415
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:12,360
pressure deficits are are were

416
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,119
recorded this was interesting these were

417
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:18,038
interesting data because of the large

418
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:21,000
range and I'll try to explain why you

419
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:22,400
might at least what we is one factor

420
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,079
that might be responsible for why you're

421
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,360
getting very high yields but also very

422
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,399
low yields here but again just pointing

423
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,240
out this correlation among these climate

424
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,159
factors that are important in in

425
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,159
determining May's

426
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,400
productivity

427
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:42,200
so I didn't I was going to present some

428
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,400
data initial data on the statistical

429
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:48,319
modeling that Liz has done but I decided

430
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,280
not to because I felt like it uh I I I

431
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,839
wasn't confident enough of my knowledge

432
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:55,519
of that modeling to do that but I did

433
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:57,599
want to present one thing one first to

434
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,038
note that in the modeling that she's

435
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,319
done so far all the climate factors were

436
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:04,079
significant so

437
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,119
BPD

438
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,960
precipitation temperature and the

439
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:09,678
temperature thresholds that we looked at

440
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,159
the indices that we looked at all came

441
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,200
out to be having significant impact on

442
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:15,640
on maze

443
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,038
yields the biggest impact though

444
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:24,280
interestingly enough was planting

445
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:26,440
rate and uh my interpretation of that is

446
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,879
that

447
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,798
um what what it appeared to be is is

448
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,799
that in the yield contests The Growers

449
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,960
were were actually too conservative in

450
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:40,119
their planting rate what we found when

451
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,840
we looked at the rainfed data for the

452
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:48,439
four states we looked at is

453
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:51,240
that and under all scenarios under all

454
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,360
vapor pressure deficits you did better

455
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,279
by increasing your planting rate so you

456
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:59,399
got higher yields no matter whether it

457
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,200
was uh no matter what epd

458
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,038
I think again this comes back to the

459
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,120
fact that these these Con in these

460
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,480
contests they're um picking their best

461
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,719
sites so these sites are going to have a

462
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,798
maximum water holding Capac soil water

463
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:17,480
holding capacity and I think they for

464
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:20,319
2012 uh in that year they were just able

465
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,240
to they had enough stored soil water to

466
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,839
to produce a a pretty good yield That's

467
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,679
my kind of interpretation but we're

468
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,519
still analyzing these data but again

469
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,679
note that even

470
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,200
uh at very high planting

471
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,519
rates uh you know that's where you got

472
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,840
your maximum yield at all vapor pressure

473
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:42,200
deficits I should say that you know

474
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:44,399
we're focused on rainfed maze here and

475
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,000
and humid production humid region

476
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,038
production this is not dry land

477
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,720
production dry land production the

478
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:56,919
recommendations for planting rate are

479
00:20:50,720 --> 00:21:01,200
much lower than um uh than uh what um uh

480
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:05,080
we're showing here in part that's to for

481
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,360
uh I think to for for the because

482
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:10,639
Growers tend to be risk averse but also

483
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:14,599
the the uh the the seed companies are

484
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,799
predicting or not predicting but um

485
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:19,519
prescribing lower planting rates in part

486
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:22,679
because they don't want to have the onus

487
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,918
of having a total crop failure but

488
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,679
that's not what we're talking about

489
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,240
we're talking about rainfed humid region

490
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,600
production here

491
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,278
so a couple of the problems that that

492
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,038
that Liz she's settling on an

493
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:37,759
appropriate methodology for variable

494
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,240
selection and coefficient estimation and

495
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,200
modeling statistical modeling the

496
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,200
problem that she's had is a correlation

497
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,200
that I just mentioned among the climate

498
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,200
variables but also that there's a

499
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,000
spatial correlation between management

500
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,600
and climate variables and that's uh Liz

501
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,480
is I think getting to a point where

502
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,480
we're close

503
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,239
rightz it's been long process but she's

504
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,278
done an excellent job on

505
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,919
it

506
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:10,200
um so I'll move on to the second

507
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,520
question which is this gets back to the

508
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,480
vpds is there evidence to support this

509
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:17,079
Assumption of higher vpds in the Corn

510
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,960
Belt under climate

511
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:22,918
change now this is really out of my out

512
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,079
of my Waters here but this is what I'm

513
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,679
I'm understanding is is

514
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:31,678
occurring the precipitation most most of

515
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,600
the precipitation for the US corn belt

516
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,880
comes from systems coming out of the

517
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,839
Gulf of Mexico they come up the

518
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,200
Mississippi Valley and they they and

519
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:41,199
produce

520
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,440
rainfall when that doesn't there are

521
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,480
occasions though where you get these

522
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,600
episodic droughts this occurs when a

523
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,079
high pressure system embeds in the

524
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,439
midwest it blocks the transporter

525
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:59,918
precipitation of these systems up from

526
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,000
the Gulf of Mexico and and this has

527
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,000
occurred in

528
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,440
1983 1988 and then as I've been talking

529
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,319
quite a bit about in

530
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,000
2012 the sequence of events is important

531
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,278
here because what it what as far as I

532
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,240
understand from the

533
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:21,640
literature the main instigator is reduce

534
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:25,839
precipitation so there's less

535
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,640
rainfall this reduces Regional evapo

536
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,918
transpiration that means that more of

537
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,200
the incoming slower ations getting part

538
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,278
partitioned to sensible heat which

539
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,880
atmospheric heating let's say higher

540
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:39,519
temperatures and these higher

541
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,880
temperatures lead to the higher vapor

542
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:45,079
pressure deficits so the the real

543
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,960
instigator is not that there are going

544
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:50,158
to be higher vapor pressure

545
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,278
deficits as a blanket you know as a

546
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,400
blanket statement for all future

547
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:55,960
climates it's only going to be during

548
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,519
these episodic droughts and the

549
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,120
instigator is going to be reduced

550
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,599
precipitation

551
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:05,359
it is unclear whether these episodic

552
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:07,558
droughts events where you have these

553
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,479
high pressure systems embedding in the

554
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:11,960
in the region whether it'll be more or

555
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,798
less likely to occur with climate change

556
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,798
I did think it was interesting that um

557
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,759
one of the candidates for the geospatial

558
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:23,158
position Nathan

559
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:25,440
Mueller from in his work uh the

560
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,799
prediction was that this they will not

561
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,679
be more frequent that in fact it's

562
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:31,440
there's likely to be higher

563
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,640
precipitations

564
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,200
precipitation total precipitation during

565
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,520
the growing season in the in the midwest

566
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
but that there's still on some

567
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,798
uncertainty about that so with respect

568
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,720
to whether there'll be higher vpds I

569
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,918
think based on this I would say it's not

570
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,159
if they're are if they are higher

571
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,799
they're not going to be significantly

572
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,880
higher and the only time you'll get them

573
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:55,319
is during these episodic

574
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,440
droughts so then they'll move on to the

575
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:02,278
kind of uh the third question is

576
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,840
can we what can we say about the impact

577
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:11,880
of climate on key processes in Maze and

578
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:15,359
for this I'm going to um move more to uh

579
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:18,000
um uh to a little more in depth on the

580
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:21,959
impact on on on the crop and in

581
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,079
particular focus on the dial dynamics of

582
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,079
of evapo transpiration in particular uh

583
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:29,278
not so much on carbon assimilation

584
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:31,359
although we did that but look at dial

585
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:35,558
Dynamics at the field

586
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:37,278
level um of those processes in relation

587
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:40,278
to

588
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,679
temperature and vapor pressure deficits

589
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:45,359
or evaporative

590
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,559
demand so the way I'm going to do that

591
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:51,879
is by by talking about work that we've

592
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:55,480
done using flux Tower data and AD

593
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:58,278
covariant methodology to look at fluxes

594
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,200
of so latent heat flux or VAP

595
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:02,960
transpiration and sensible heat fluxes

596
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,759
in other words

597
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:09,120
heating

598
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:11,640
um and then in in with additional data

599
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,599
look at some some other things including

600
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,880
changes in canopy

601
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,798
temperature changes in aerodynamic

602
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,840
conductance I won't talk about that but

603
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:25,240
that's one of the key factors that is is

604
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:26,839
um is um involved but then in particular

605
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,399
focus on canopy

606
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:32,599
conductance um and as a function of

607
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:37,000
these climate variables dially and at

608
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:40,558
the field level we mainly focused on uh

609
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,919
aerlex Towers in me

610
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,200
Nebraska and we looked at the irrigated

611
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:46,679
maze towers and I'll explain a little

612
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,480
bit why we did

613
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,798
that we also had a Tower in Aurora

614
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,880
ourselves in Aurora last year which

615
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:56,839
actually produce quite good data I won't

616
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:01,720
be getting to those data uh I just don't

617
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,720
have time so we focus mostly on the me

618
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,119
data so uh this is hopefully going to

619
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,640
help set up a little bit of what I'm

620
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:14,639
what I'm going to talk

621
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:17,038
about when we're talking about um these

622
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,038
fluxes latent heat and sensible heat

623
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,200
fluxes the amount of energy coming into

624
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,720
a a

625
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:28,360
field to the to the surface of the

626
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:32,798
canopy is the the described here is

627
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:34,240
incoming solar minus reflected uh R

628
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,359
solar

629
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,200
radiation plus the difference between

630
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,639
long wave in Long wave out we're we're

631
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,200
calling that the net radiation so that's

632
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,960
total energy coming into the top of the

633
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,080
canopy that energy has to be dissipated

634
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,240
somehow in order to balance the equation

635
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:53,319
it can either be lost as a vapo

636
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,440
transpiration or it can be lost as

637
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:57,759
sensible heat sensible heat just means

638
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,798
you have an object at a higher

639
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,480
temperature

640
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,000
and a lower temperature and it's the

641
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,839
energy transfer from the higher

642
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,798
temperature to the lower temperature

643
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:09,439
when we're talking about a crop this

644
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:11,558
almost always during sunlight hours

645
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,159
means the temperature of the canopy is

646
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:17,599
higher and we're transferring energy

647
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:20,440
from that canopy to a lower temperature

648
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:25,038
atmosphere um

649
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:27,080
so the way you can think of how the crop

650
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,759
impacts this so there so so there are

651
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:32,319
two Factor fa s that that affect how

652
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,599
this energy partition between vapid

653
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,480
transpiration and sensible heat loss one

654
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:38,599
is

655
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,679
VPD so that will affect it higher vpds

656
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:43,000
will shift it more towards evapo

657
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,559
transpiration less towards sensible heat

658
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,839
loss but the plant has control over that

659
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,918
through crop

660
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:52,918
conductance so it so at higher crop

661
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,440
conductances you have the same effect a

662
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:59,278
shift towards more uh VAP transpiration

663
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,720
under any given set of conditions

664
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:07,359
at lower crop cond conductances in other

665
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:11,480
words like underwater stress you shift

666
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:12,959
the um energy uh is shifted more towards

667
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,120
sensible heat loss in other words the

668
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,200
canopy heats

669
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:20,798
up so I hope that that helps a little

670
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,399
bit when I talk in the next few slides

671
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:27,119
but another thing to note is that

672
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:29,719
globally about 80% of the net radiation

673
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,599
is dissipated through through evapor

674
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,798
transporation so that when we're talking

675
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,839
about increases in temperature increases

676
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:40,319
in evaporative demand the there's a

677
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:43,079
limit set by the amount of incoming

678
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:47,158
energy as to how much can be shifted how

679
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:50,759
much more evapo transpiration can occur

680
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,000
if you look at this example if we're if

681
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,398
at we're averaging around 6 millim per

682
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,798
day of a vapo

683
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:59,158
transpiration where 80% and that

684
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:02,000
represents 80% of the total net

685
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:04,440
radiation the most you can get

686
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,119
most increase in that that you can get

687
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,278
is about 2 7.5 millimeters per day so

688
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:13,639
there's a real limit so you it's not

689
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:15,558
like um uh you know you can you just are

690
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,519
Capp by the incoming energy so that's an

691
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:22,319
important thing to keep in

692
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:25,480
mind so here's some kind of uh just a

693
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:28,319
look at some of the D dial Dynamics in

694
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,000
kind of broad terms these are data from

695
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:35,200
from one of the ameriflux towers at me

696
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,960
just showing a typical kind of dial

697
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:44,759
sequence of of um of changes the this

698
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,640
kind of orangish bar is the incoming net

699
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:49,359
radiation the green is the evaporate

700
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,559
transpiration or latent

701
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:55,759
heat and the red is sensible heat this

702
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:58,278
is for a well-watered canopy so you can

703
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,879
see that most of the incoming net

704
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:03,278
radiation is account accounted for in in

705
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,240
by a vapo transpiration and very little

706
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:08,440
by sensible heat uh uh

707
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,919
transfer one thing to note is that the

708
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,840
blue dash line is a is vapor pressure

709
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,639
deficit so the key thing to note is that

710
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,839
the highest vapor pressure deficits are

711
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:20,079
actually occurring later in the day when

712
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,398
net radiation's low of APPA

713
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,480
transpiration low that will come back to

714
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:27,239
that in a

715
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,480
bit so this what this is a kind of a

716
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,880
typical water stress canopy then same

717
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,159
incoming net

718
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,360
radiation but because we're beginning to

719
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,840
get stod closure or reduction crop

720
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:41,158
conductance the shift and partitioning

721
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:44,119
of that energy is now more to tensible

722
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:47,039
heat and less to latent heat or less to

723
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:49,599
evaporative evapor transpiration so

724
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:52,038
what's the what's the impact the impact

725
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,918
is that we look at air temperature

726
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:56,919
versus canopy temperature for that water

727
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,519
stress example we're now getting canopy

728
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:02,720
temperatures that are sign ific above

729
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:06,159
air temperature and we'll we'll I'll

730
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,159
explain more about that a

731
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:12,240
bit so this is these are data from uh

732
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:16,199
the

733
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,759
me tower towers for irrigated maze for

734
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,880
2010 11 and 12 so you might wonder why

735
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,638
we're using irrigated data here when

736
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:28,720
we're I'm talking about rain in part on

737
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:31,000
about rainfed bze it it just so happened

738
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,200
fortuitously for us but maybe not for

739
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,079
them so much that in 2012 they basically

740
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,278
weren't able to keep up with the

741
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,119
irrigation so they actually had

742
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,038
essentially a deficit irrigation they

743
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:44,518
were getting water stress in their crop

744
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:47,720
and so that actually turned out nicely

745
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:50,960
because uh we were not able to get uh

746
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,839
rainfed data from those Towers in 2012

747
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,278
they didn't they were in a a soybean

748
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:59,158
maze rotation and um that year they

749
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,359
happened to be in soybean for the for

750
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:04,639
the rainfed

751
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:08,000
towers so the first thing to note is you

752
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:09,678
know what we what we see here is vapor

753
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,558
pressure deficits over the course of the

754
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,320
day this is for the for the growing

755
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:16,440
season this is from canopy closure to

756
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:20,278
the beginning of sence so it's time when

757
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,840
there's a full canopy but no syence

758
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:26,079
these are the compiled data over that

759
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:27,798
time um for the different hours here so

760
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,759
the vapor pressure deficits remain

761
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:33,038
fairly low during the the two years

762
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:35,919
where there was good irrigation there

763
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:38,879
were not and they were not drought years

764
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,320
during 2012 like we've been talking

765
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,200
about the vapor def vapor pressure

766
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:45,398
deficits increased

767
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,558
considerably and

768
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:52,719
um and again that have we we saw that

769
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:58,359
earlier in some of the uh data that we

770
00:33:52,720 --> 00:34:00,558
showed from um for the yield contest

771
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:02,000
so this is interesting because this

772
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,480
shows latent

773
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,398
heat evapor Transportation as a fra as a

774
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,199
fraction net

775
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:12,960
radiation over time for these for the

776
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,759
same three years so keep in mind net

777
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,398
radiation is appr approximately equal to

778
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,800
latent heat plus sensible heat or vapor

779
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:23,719
transp Transportation plus sensible heat

780
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,599
so you can see through most of the day

781
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:28,279
we're at about 08 so that's about well

782
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:31,838
as I was pointing out

783
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:35,119
for globally about 80% of the of net

784
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:37,119
radiation is accounted for by by a vapo

785
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,639
transpiration and that's pretty and

786
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,720
we're so this is pretty consistent with

787
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,399
us and that occurred in all three years

788
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,918
but note later in the day this is when

789
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:49,878
the vpds are increasing we do see an

790
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,918
increase in all three years in the

791
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:54,679
fraction of net radiation that's

792
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:58,279
accounted for Via vapa

793
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:00,519
transporation and it goes up again in

794
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,320
all three years what was interesting is

795
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:06,320
that is

796
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:09,559
2012 so in 2012 it actually went above

797
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,039
the ratio went above one so how can that

798
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:14,639
be well that happens because the canopy

799
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:17,199
is actually being cooled to the point

800
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:19,480
where there's now the sensible heat flux

801
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,358
is reversed you're actually getting Tre

802
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,159
heat transfer energy transfer from the

803
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,519
atmosphere to the

804
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:28,399
canopy the question is from a kind of a

805
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,880
production standpoint

806
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,480
with respect to these drought periods is

807
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,000
is is this a good

808
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:39,679
thing we're we're losing water here and

809
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,559
it's and it's occurring at a time when

810
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,719
net radiation is going

811
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:45,838
down uh there's not that much

812
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:47,799
photosynthesis crop photosynthesis is

813
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:48,920
actually declin pretty pretty pretty

814
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,519
steeply

815
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,639
then what if we were able to stop this

816
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,000
could we conserve water in these drought

817
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:59,239
years and potentially you know get a

818
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,358
higher yield under those conditions

819
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:03,959
and I'll come back to that but that's

820
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:03,960
something to

821
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:09,239
consider what was all so this is shows

822
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,079
the crop conductance and it shows that

823
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,519
so this is a typical pattern that we see

824
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,800
for

825
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:17,800
well-watered um uh crop conductance over

826
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:23,400
over the period of the

827
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:26,359
day so 201110 2011 2012 was lower by the

828
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:30,200
time crop canopy closure occurred in

829
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:31,799
this s in these uh in these fields there

830
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:33,039
are the drought was already in place

831
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,079
they were not keeping up with the

832
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,039
irrigation so we are already seeing

833
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:38,920
evidence of that by lower crop

834
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:42,480
conductances in

835
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:45,720
2012 so even though conductance is going

836
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,760
down you'd think would be would then um

837
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:52,559
reduce evap transpiration the very high

838
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,800
vpds that we saw earlier

839
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:58,400
here were were high enough to counteract

840
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,760
that and create you know actually result

841
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,720
in this where we were getting evap

842
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,839
transpiration at such a high rate that

843
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:11,838
we were actually getting canopy

844
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:14,239
cooling so and this this this shows what

845
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:16,440
the kind of net result of that is is

846
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,239
that instead of showing that instead of

847
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,720
that canopy being much higher than air

848
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:23,479
temperature than the temperatures that

849
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:25,480
we see in the irrigat years it actually

850
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,280
was being maintained pretty close to

851
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,318
those and really not in in a Range where

852
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,319
we'd expect any temperature

853
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:35,838
impact is so is this a good thing you

854
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,599
might argue that it's better to keep

855
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:39,159
temperatures it's better to lose a

856
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,000
little bit of water and keep those

857
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:42,639
temperatures canopy temperatures a

858
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,480
little cooler if your main concern is

859
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,000
temperature if your main concern is

860
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,599
water you might go the other way and say

861
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,719
well let's have some more stomato

862
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:55,359
closure and and we'll sacrifice a little

863
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:55,358
higher temperatures but we'll save some

864
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:01,078
water so this shows was just kind of

865
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,720
kind of a summary graph where we're

866
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,920
looking at a vapid

867
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:08,159
transpiration in millimeters per hour as

868
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,760
a function of vapor pressure deficit

869
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:15,920
color codes the same we have blue for

870
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:19,000
2010 Green for 2011 and red for

871
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:22,119
2012 so the thing to note here and this

872
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,679
gets back to how much total vapid

873
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,920
transporation can occur when you're

874
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:28,598
tapped by the amount of limited by the

875
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,720
amount of energy coming in you can see

876
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:33,519
that at about two kPa vapor pressure

877
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:36,279
deficit basically you you can't

878
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,838
transpire any more water that's kind of

879
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,480
it

880
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:43,078
um you can see the impact of lower

881
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,119
conductance in 2012 in that at any given

882
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:49,480
VPD we're getting higher vapid ET rates

883
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,640
in 2010 and

884
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,000
2011 but you'll see at the higher

885
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:56,199
highest vpds we are that those are

886
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
occurring in 2012 and we're seeing those

887
00:38:56,199 --> 00:39:01,358
out here there's quite a scatter of

888
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,639
points here and I'll show this in a bit

889
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:05,318
but this is

890
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:07,838
because net radiation is going down at

891
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:10,559
the time the highest vpds are occurring

892
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:13,920
and so you're actually getting uh even

893
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:16,318
though you're at a maximum or above Max

894
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,159
you know the vapid transformation as a

895
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:20,759
fraction net radiation is actually above

896
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:23,679
one the total amount of water loss is

897
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,680
actually not that

898
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,599
high so now I'll get to the last

899
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:34,199
question which is this issue

900
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:38,599
of what what do you want to do in terms

901
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:42,719
of trying to to improve crops improve

902
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:46,880
maze hybrids for uh these episodic

903
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:49,480
droughts and what Pioneer has has opted

904
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,240
to do in their breeding is to come out

905
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,960
with so-called drought tolerant

906
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:57,159
varities and those drought tolerant

907
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,400
varieties one of the it's clear that one

908
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:01,279
of of the traits that has been

909
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,838
introduced is

910
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,800
the that they have made them sensitive

911
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,759
to vapor pressure deficit so above a

912
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,599
certain vapor pressure deficit the

913
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,079
stamata begin to

914
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:16,318
close and the idea is you're conserving

915
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:20,640
water uh during those drought years so

916
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:22,759
that you uh have enough water to get a

917
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,078
decent yield at the end of the growing

918
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,880
season and these are so I'm calling

919
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:28,560
these kind of reduced transpiration

920
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,318
hybrids

921
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:34,119
so they've opted for the water

922
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:37,880
conservation and not for any impact that

923
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:40,680
there might be on as a result of that on

924
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:44,960
temperature so this shows some some

925
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:46,919
modeling uh results to that were uh from

926
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,000
a paper and journal of experimental

927
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,519
bodney uh by P the Pioneer folks

928
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,800
primarily to try to demonstrate what the

929
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:57,400
value of this trait might be they have

930
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,480
their drought tolerant and drought

931
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,160
sensitive is the dash looking at changes

932
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,480
in soil moisture over the growing season

933
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:08,639
and you'll see that early on with this

934
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,760
trait of reduced transpiration trait

935
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:13,318
there was less water extracted from the

936
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,839
profile and more water towards the end

937
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:18,838
of the growing season in the drought

938
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:21,199
tolerant Co D drought tolerant variety

939
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:23,440
when they looked at total biomass and

940
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:26,799
yield with this in this modeling

941
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,200
exercise you'll see that up to a certain

942
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,480
point they were both the same but then

943
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:34,799
late in the season because the more

944
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,760
available water deeper in the Pro in the

945
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,519
soil profile with a drought on that Vari

946
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,480
was able to use that water and produce

947
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,480
more yield and more total

948
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:50,239
biomass so what we did just to kind of

949
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,800
take a quick look at this was we did a

950
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:55,919
modeling exercise where we looked at

951
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:02,240
York Kansas in

952
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:03,639
2012 a very again very hot very dry uh

953
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:07,000
um

954
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:09,480
period and we looked at two scenarios

955
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,039
one was where we had crop conductance

956
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,199
independent of vapor pressure deficit

957
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:16,039
and one where we allowed it to be

958
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:19,838
dependent on vapor pressure deficit

959
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:24,440
Based on data from a paper that was used

960
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:26,400
as one of the kind of um U kind of

961
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,440
foundations for this introducing this

962
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,559
trade into these drought toer varieties

963
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:35,240
or or trans

964
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:37,800
sensitive reduced transpiration

965
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:39,799
varieties so the first thing is the

966
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,800
total amount of ET that

967
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,680
occurred with when it was independent

968
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:48,480
was 2117 millimet over this month versus

969
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,879
182 millimeters when you have made this

970
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,358
crop conductors dependent on BPD so it

971
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,720
does save water at least based on our

972
00:42:54,358 --> 00:43:00,119
our uh our work here if you you look at

973
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:02,639
vapid transpiration hourly as a function

974
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:05,200
of vapor pressure deficit these kind we

975
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:08,279
saw this just just in a few slides

976
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:09,639
previously showing kind of a cap around

977
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,760
2

978
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:16,519
kPa what's interesting is the blue are

979
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:19,680
pro before 3 p.m. the red are 1 to 3

980
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:21,599
p.m. and the green are after 3 p.m. so

981
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:25,719
this just illustrates that even though

982
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,800
the vpds were very high uh later the

983
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:30,000
total amount of water loss was not as

984
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,960
high as earlier because the net

985
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,079
radiation was

986
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,800
lower so this is for the indep where

987
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:40,079
crop conductance is independent vapor

988
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:44,440
pressure deficit where it's dependent we

989
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:48,920
actually cap this at a lower um ET rate

990
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:50,000
So at around 7 millimeters uh 7 millimet

991
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,639
per

992
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,800
hour so we get the we get the savings of

993
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:58,239
water and that's a that's a good thing

994
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,640
if if you're in an you're in a drought

995
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:04,358
situation and you want to um uh have uh

996
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:07,039
you're willing to sacrifice maybe a

997
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:08,920
little bit yield uh in the really good

998
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,880
years but you're going to get more yield

999
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,720
in the drier drier

1000
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:17,440
years the problem is here is is

1001
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,598
temperature so in this scenario we had

1002
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,800
air

1003
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:23,400
temperature we looked at canopy

1004
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,880
temperature with no VPD dependence and

1005
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,760
canopy canopy temperature where there

1006
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:32,318
was a dependence of CR conductance on

1007
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,160
BPD got a little screwed up here but the

1008
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:38,079
the air temperature over that period the

1009
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:41,279
maximum air temperature was around 37

1010
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:45,039
C no VPD dependence the canopy

1011
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,880
temperature was around 38 degre C when

1012
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:49,239
you hadn't made a VP dependent you were

1013
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,079
saving water the result was that you

1014
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:55,598
increase your canopy temperature so the

1015
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:58,240
question is what do you want you if you

1016
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,240
you have this trade you'll save water

1017
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,078
but you're going to get higher canopy

1018
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,399
canopy temperatures you're going to

1019
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,640
start getting canopy temperatures

1020
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,639
presumably into the into the yes

1021
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,519
well

1022
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:48,039
I the what they did when they they they

1023
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:50,239
they they looked at a large range of

1024
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:53,279
genotypes and this this initial work

1025
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:55,879
that was done on this and they just did

1026
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,559
it was growth chamber work and looked at

1027
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,280
imposing different paper pressure

1028
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:01,880
deficits and at what point did they

1029
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,519
begin to get a shift in in transpiration

1030
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:08,000
indicating a a sensitivity of stamata to

1031
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:10,039
vapor pressure deficit a lot of

1032
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,880
genotypes didn't show that response but

1033
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:16,000
there were some that did so that kind of

1034
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:19,838
apparently was the foundation for moving

1035
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,440
to to uh to trying to um include this

1036
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,358
trade into the into the

1037
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:29,119
hybrids

1038
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:31,159
um so again again you know you you can

1039
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,519
save water but you but you potentially

1040
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:36,118
are pushing canopy temperatures pretty

1041
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:39,480
high paper just recently came out in

1042
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:40,960
crop science where this they you know

1043
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,599
there was some recognition of the

1044
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,440
problem with this and so what they've

1045
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,119
tried to identify and they think they

1046
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,559
have identified are hybrids that are

1047
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:53,240
sensitive to VPD so they shut down or

1048
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:56,119
they reduce transpiration at higher vpds

1049
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:58,719
but at a certain temperature they lose

1050
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:01,200
that and they to open up and so they

1051
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:03,159
been to cool at around and this seems to

1052
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,199
be around 38°

1053
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:09,279
c i i i mean that that needs to be

1054
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:12,039
looked into because what I tried to

1055
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,000
point out is these high vpds CO coincide

1056
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:17,039
with droughts so the stamat are already

1057
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,159
responding to a crop W to a soil

1058
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:23,838
moisture stress I don't know how much

1059
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:26,480
more uh this trait you know this this

1060
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:28,239
this you how this might interact with

1061
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,159
what we know is already going on but

1062
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,199
that's that was interesting that there

1063
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:35,679
began to be recognition that this could

1064
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:39,879
be a potentially serious issue

1065
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:42,519
here so that's just a very brief and

1066
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,480
very uh kind of cursory overview of what

1067
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:46,599
we're

1068
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:49,119
doing and we hope to be able to continue

1069
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:51,680
this work particularly uh extend the

1070
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,559
statistical modeling uh to include other

1071
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:57,239
regions and also do more work on our

1072
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,440
Edie covariant and crop growth growth

1073
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:02,000
modeling uh looking more into these

1074
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,559
interactions between the climate and the

1075
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:09,000
crop I want to acknowledge the the group

1076
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:12,160
I mentioned before and these other folks

1077
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:17,159
uh for all the work all the U input that

1078
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:21,639
they provided for us um in particular uh

1079
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:24,519
Andy schwier at me for the marlux data

1080
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:27,799
Paul Sakowski and staff at Musgrave for

1081
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:29,358
the flux Tower uh couple of folks at

1082
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:33,079
Pioneer for information on their

1083
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:35,318
cultivars and Tim for some helpful

1084
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:37,800
discussions and that's our fux Tower

1085
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:41,119
from last year and

1086
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,119
Aurora so

1087
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:51,160
thanks thanks je um just a quick

1088
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:51,159
question on the drer variety

1089
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:57,399
yields

1090
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,400
back like

1091
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:10,409
[Music]

1092
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:15,118
sorry toward the end

1093
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:49,759
are theyed to withraw

1094
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:59,489
[Music]

1095
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:04,720
well I believe they

1096
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:08,318
[Music]

1097
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:10,318
don't I think again we are looking at

1098
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:14,039
the best the

1099
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,039
best know that's a good

1100
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:21,680
point as far as I know they're not not

1101
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:21,679
oated

1102
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:35,039
we did find quite low yields in the rain

1103
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,440
so it's not

1104
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:38,440
like we don't

1105
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:58,000
get explain this but my

1106
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:01,880
understanding sign is not much of a CR

1107
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:05,559
person was that the key he determining

1108
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:09,039
Factor around and corn is basically

1109
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:13,559
around tling so and so when I look at

1110
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:17,119
that top graph if you are the Dr

1111
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:19,880
cut basically by shutting Stone doesn't

1112
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,599
it sort of increase and the effects of

1113
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:26,798
the Dr I'm surprised that you that you

1114
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:29,000
don't that you get higher yelds when you

1115
00:51:26,798 --> 00:51:32,519
the stress during thetical

1116
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,880
time well so so do you increase the

1117
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:41,000
stress dur critical

1118
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:44,640
time I think the the reading is such

1119
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,280
that um and I didn't show this graph but

1120
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:51,318
reading is such that the varities that

1121
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:56,119
show this are still are still performing

1122
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:58,519
well under both well watered and and um

1123
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:58,519
and

1124
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,039
conditions if you if you the response

1125
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,838
was so

1126
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:10,480
great that you were shutting down for a

1127
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:13,000
sens and

1128
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,760
you I don't think we're talking about a

1129
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,960
big a big difference we're not talking

1130
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,160
about because these this is occurring in

1131
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:25,559
dpds that are above about

1132
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:28,118
2k so it's not like um it's it's it's

1133
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:31,640
you know we're talking order 30 mm in

1134
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:33,599
water so it's not

1135
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:36,798
imposing I don't know if I'm answering

1136
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:40,838
this but it's not I don't think it's a

1137
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:43,440
significant stress and not during during

1138
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:46,719
that

1139
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:50,559
critical um if they you know if it was a

1140
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:54,879
very significant loss it was

1141
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,880
very strong ruction

1142
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:09,558
I mean in the in that show some cond

1143
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:11,598
in2 at every hour of the day was lower

1144
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:15,519
so remember

1145
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,519
that so it could be

1146
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:24,639
that by allowing the to regulate that

1147
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:27,639
then it would you know just have normal

1148
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:27,639
conductiv

1149
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,920
shedal throughout the times of the

1150
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,480
day yeah well I mean that was water strs

1151
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:43,159
was causing that so that I didn't show

1152
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:46,119
this but what interesting about that

1153
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:48,279
that if you look at the the carbon

1154
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:51,280
exchange it actually wasn't all that

1155
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:54,200
much impact they were pretty simar on

1156
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,359
all three years and in facts that they

1157
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:59,759
got in all those were not that much

1158
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:02,639
different we were pretty close so even

1159
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,440
though it showed this response in 2012

1160
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,440
that they clearly not keeping up and we

1161
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:20,480
Hader back to the slide that shows the

1162
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:22,920
uh effective deficit at different

1163
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,920
planing

1164
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:28,719
densities I me to say that that

1165
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:31,279
it was counterintuitive to me and I

1166
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:31,279
wonder if you

1167
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:39,079
can so in other words it shows that at

1168
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:43,200
low planting density the yield suffers

1169
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:46,760
more as as V goes up than high

1170
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:50,519
planting I know it doesn't it

1171
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,520
doesn't but I

1172
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:56,798
think I think what we're looking at is

1173
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,839
the quality of the SS so I think these

1174
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:03,159
sites there's not we're not seeing as

1175
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:04,719
you notice the yields were quite High R

1176
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:09,679
familiar

1177
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:11,039
withs you know 14 or 15s that's pretty

1178
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:14,318
so I think we're talking about really

1179
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:16,798
good size it's important to important to

1180
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:19,920
keep that in mind

1181
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:23,280
about so actually they were were these

1182
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:26,599
rat were too low they were losing yield

1183
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:29,519
by because they were not getting enough

1184
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:31,559
out were the optimum density for that

1185
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:34,000
for those

1186
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,760
conditions so they could put more plants

1187
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,838
in there they were they were below the

1188
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:43,000
optimum for p were getting the

1189
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:46,519
maximum wouldn't think that would be the

1190
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:51,639
case it was I mean at any given

1191
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:53,159
BPD yields go down at any given planting

1192
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:57,118
go down you

1193
00:55:53,159 --> 00:56:00,798
increase well not much at 100,000

1194
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:03,240
so so so the plants at 100,000 they're

1195
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:06,358
maintaining the per plant yield even as

1196
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:09,318
BPD doubles seems

1197
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:11,199
amazing that's that's again my

1198
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:13,838
interpretation of that is that is there

1199
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:15,279
yield contest okay okay so that's that's

1200
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:17,679
what

1201
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,400
I'm some of this correlation or

1202
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:21,118
relationship is driven by

1203
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,318
non-independence between planting

1204
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,599
density and the and and the location

1205
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:29,719
yeah people with really good soils they

1206
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:32,280
plant high density and yeah but

1207
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:33,959
also the the lower densities were more

1208
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:37,440
in the western part of the

1209
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,440
Corn where were

1210
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:44,358
H could you also say that at low

1211
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:47,798
planting

1212
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:51,598
densities the at low planting densities

1213
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:53,199
if the plants are not under VPD stress

1214
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,798
they can kind of

1215
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:57,598
compensate but if they are under VPD

1216
00:56:55,798 --> 00:57:01,599
stress they they can't compensate for

1217
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,599
the low density does that make

1218
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:20,358
sense actually actually we're looking

1219
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:22,480
the whole idea issue of lower

1220
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:27,598
planting how much water you actually

1221
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,599
save that's something that

1222
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:36,920
