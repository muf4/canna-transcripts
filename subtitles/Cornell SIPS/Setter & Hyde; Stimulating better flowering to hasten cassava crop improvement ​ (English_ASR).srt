1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:12,209
University initially when I was

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,400
organizing the seminar program for the

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,138
fall is very nervous about having a lot

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,460
of gaps that I wouldn't be able to fill

6
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:23,129
with speakers and happily we've we

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,880
filled them all up in fact initially my

8
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:29,460
plan was if I had to I would give one

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,390
seminar on Kesava and a second one on

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,660
Mays and you're really lucky because

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:41,120
they build them up and I arranged that

12
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:43,799
the seminar on cassava is going to be a

13
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:49,530
joint or shared seminar between myself

14
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:52,229
and my senior a research associate Peter

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,649
Hyde who is going to give you most of

16
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:58,738
the actual data and results from our

17
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,570
next gen cassava project so I'm gonna

18
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,929
just give you a little bit of a lead-in

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,659
and give you some context on the project

20
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:09,030
as a whole and then Peter is going to

21
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,700
show you most of the work on cassava

22
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:18,900
flowering that we've done in pursuit of

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:21,509
this project so the next-gen cassava

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,580
project is a large project funded by the

25
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:28,978
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and by

26
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:31,319
US or UK aid and we have as you can see

27
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:35,039
on this slide a number of institutions

28
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:38,578
that participate our participants in

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,490
this project the project is led and

30
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:46,798
managed by Cornell University out of

31
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:50,069
International Programs and the so Ronnie

32
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,360
Kaufman as the head of IP Cal's is the

33
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:57,449
principal investigator on record and the

34
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,789
lead project is a breeding project for

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,149
cassava and that I would say that the

36
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:08,689
lead technical lead is jean-luc Jenning

37
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:12,110
on that project so we have these other

38
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:12,109
participants who are

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,840
on the project doing breeding programs

40
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:20,509
and mainly our target is in Africa so we

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,280
have International Institute of

42
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:25,979
Agriculture in Nigeria and the national

43
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,640
program for cassava breeding which is

44
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:32,159
located in dk Nigeria we also have the

45
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:35,399
national programs in Uganda and in

46
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:39,840
Tanzania as participants in this project

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,000
and in this project has been underway

48
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,879
for approximately five years and we've

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,909
just made the transition from phase 1 to

50
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:53,219
phase 2 and phase 2 as we made sort of

51
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:56,848
gone along we've picked up contributions

52
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:58,919
from two other important places in the

53
00:02:56,848 --> 00:03:03,419
world where cassava breeding is taking

54
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:05,669
place the the the International Centre

55
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:08,429
for tropical agriculture in Colombia and

56
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:11,818
the Umbra in Brazil there's also even

57
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:15,209
some participation by folks in Hawaii

58
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:18,000
for germplasm transfer from Latin

59
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:21,780
America to Africa so the project

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,079
involves quite a lot of participation by

61
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:29,250
groups throughout and we do our best to

62
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:34,709
in to become a coordinated project among

63
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:37,530
all the team members now the places that

64
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:40,769
we work correspond to the largest

65
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,019
production areas in Africa for cassava

66
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,810
and this map shows you the area

67
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:49,650
harvested in the world and you can see

68
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,989
that Nigeria is a lot of cassava

69
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,469
production in fact it is the largest

70
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:58,139
producer of cassava in the world and

71
00:03:54,469 --> 00:04:01,318
Africa in general represents about 55%

72
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:04,650
of the total production of cassava so we

73
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:07,379
have our focus as to work with reading

74
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,349
programs in West Africa and then these

75
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:14,159
two programs Uganda and Tanzania in East

76
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:16,409
Africa there's also a lot of cassava

77
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,709
production particularly in Thailand and

78
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,900
in Indonesia Thailand has an excellent

79
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:25,920
breeding program and they are a bit more

80
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:27,929
advanced but our work is is in

81
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,780
coordination with programs in Africa

82
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,980
where we could really make some progress

83
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:33,979
improving their programs

84
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:40,319
asada has a number of tributes

85
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:43,409
so why cassava one of the reasons is

86
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:47,310
that in fact in the world the amount of

87
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:50,280
production has increased quite a lot in

88
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,920
recent years the trim is that the rate

89
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,899
of increase is somewhere between the

90
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,420
rate of increase in rice and in maize

91
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:59,609
production much higher than the rate of

92
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,069
increase in production of potatoes and

93
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,800
wheat and so there's have been a lot of

94
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:07,879
recognition in recent years about the

95
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,670
potential for cassava as being a

96
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:13,829
important prop for the future and and

97
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:17,850
producers are increasing the production

98
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:19,769
it's a highly productive crop it grows

99
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,600
year round so it's particularly suited

100
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:23,759
for tropical conditions where it can

101
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,060
bridge between the dry and wet seasons

102
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,589
and it can utilize the land for long

103
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,319
periods of time during the year and

104
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:33,689
continue to be productive it has the

105
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,759
right it has the reputation for being

106
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:38,939
able to tolerate stresses and in some

107
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,699
way be a forgiving crop for farmers that

108
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:45,019
is to say in low nutrient or mineral

109
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:48,319
nutrient conditions it can still grow

110
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:51,629
reasonably well and provide a good

111
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,790
production and yield it can grow and

112
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:55,800
grow prone soils and as we go to

113
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,710
climates in some parts of the world that

114
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,569
are becoming warmer it is able to

115
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:03,149
tolerate in fact it thrives in the

116
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,670
warmer temperature that that are

117
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:07,889
experienced so it has potential for

118
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,110
becoming even more important in a future

119
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:12,000
and in in that sense we could say that

120
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:15,960
it's a food security a good food

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,889
security crop it also is producing a

122
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:22,259
starchy root that has many many

123
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:25,079
different uses and so it's it's very

124
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,689
versatile and so once you have the

125
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:31,889
ability to produce cassava it can be

126
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:34,649
used for home use and culinary uses at

127
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:38,879
home various types of products but it

128
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:40,810
also can be used to provide a product

129
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,600
that can be so

130
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,540
for other purposes for example more

131
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,100
purified form of starch tapioca can be

132
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,860
used for a lot of different food

133
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:55,560
manufacturing uses even industrial uses

134
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:59,530
as they do in Brazil very versatile crop

135
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:02,379
there are a lot of challenges in cassava

136
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:07,059
production and that's why we need the

137
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:09,579
next gen cassava project one is the that

138
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,129
is not reaching full yield potential and

139
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:15,639
over the years it's been recognized as a

140
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:18,069
crop that is has a lot of breeding

141
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,579
obstacles difficult one of them is that

142
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:27,389
it is a crop that in order to obtain

143
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:30,609
sufficient clones that can be tested in

144
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:32,769
uniform yield trials that are replicated

145
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,590
at different locations it takes quite a

146
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:37,689
lot of years to build up that popular

147
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:39,519
that those numbers of propagules that

148
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:42,939
are needed in order to do that kind of

149
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,669
good trial and so because of that the

150
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:49,449
breeding cycle typically takes something

151
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:51,580
like eight years or more between one set

152
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:54,389
of crossing events and the next one that

153
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:57,819
would be based on phenotypic information

154
00:07:54,389 --> 00:08:00,009
collected from the the first row so it's

155
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:03,430
it's rather been slow to make

156
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:07,060
improvements and because of that we feel

157
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:10,060
that there's a lot of untapped potential

158
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:13,720
and what we need is better methods of

159
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:16,000
breeding that will address the be able

160
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,610
to make more rapid progress accelerate

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,860
the improvement it has nutritional

162
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,290
limitations in that its purest starch

163
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,540
but it has very little vitamin mineral

164
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:28,090
content there are efforts that have been

165
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,910
successful in introducing higher Pro

166
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:34,289
vitamin A content and there are other

167
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:37,529
mineral new or other nutritional

168
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:40,179
characteristics that are part of the

169
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,668
overall strategy for self improvement

170
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:44,949
and there are some it is susceptible to

171
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:47,559
several viral and bacterial diseases

172
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,500
that are fairly serious threats

173
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:53,259
particularly in Africa for example in

174
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:57,580
Africa the cassava mosaic is the

175
00:08:53,259 --> 00:09:00,309
CMB is a very serious problem and we

176
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,290
have resistance but it needs to be

177
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:04,599
incorporated into breeding lines and

178
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:08,319
cassava brown streak is a disease that

179
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,690
is that is expanding from the east

180
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:15,240
towards the west and currently it is it

181
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:18,880
is a serious problem in Tanzania and in

182
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,669
Uganda the fear is that it will spread

183
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,169
further into West Africa the largest

184
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:26,439
cassava producing area in the world and

185
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:29,379
will devastate production if we are not

186
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,290
prepared with resistance ahead of that

187
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:38,649
so that's another of the breeding

188
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:40,959
targets so the project that Grinnell

189
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:44,110
leads is a project that uses a

190
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,240
relatively new approach towards reading

191
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,730
and that's called genomic selection and

192
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,029
genomic selection has the potential to

193
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:55,240
accelerate sabah breeding it's a led by

194
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:59,529
and this is a diagram from a seminal

195
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:03,430
article written by Hefner mark Sorrels

196
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:06,309
and John Luciano here at Cornell and it

197
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:09,069
laid out the advantages of genomic

198
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:14,409
selection over conventional and other

199
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:16,330
breeding approaches the conventional

200
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:18,669
cassava breeding as I mentioned a little

201
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:22,660
while ago involves the clonal

202
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:24,490
propagation of of the lines and in order

203
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:27,269
to have sufficient proper yields to do a

204
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,950
proper accurate multi-location

205
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:34,000
replicated trials this takes a long time

206
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:36,460
and it slows down the whole advance or

207
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,399
improvement process genomic selection

208
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,730
tries to use a different strategy that

209
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,569
will accelerate and so what we do is we

210
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:48,879
still have the need for high-quality

211
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:51,370
phenotyping but it's done on a subset of

212
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:54,100
the population a training population and

213
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:58,960
so this training population is going to

214
00:10:54,100 --> 00:11:02,620
be a subset which will represent the

215
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:05,379
breeding population as a whole and this

216
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,970
will be an ongoing process of improving

217
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:09,759
our knowledge

218
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:12,850
of this training set a training set that

219
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,889
in fact involves some changes in the

220
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:18,250
composition of the lines that are in

221
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:20,409
there what's then coupled with that is

222
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,809
that the training lines are genotype

223
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:27,279
using DNA analysis at markers that

224
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:30,369
expand throughout the genome and it

225
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,379
allows the preparation of a statistical

226
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,539
model for estimating the breeding value

227
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:36,429
of each individual based on the

228
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:39,099
phenotypic information in the training

229
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:43,509
cycle and the genotypic information from

230
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:46,509
the DNA analysis so then the program has

231
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:48,340
a model that will be able to predict the

232
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:50,169
potential breeding value of any

233
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:53,019
individual that is produced through

234
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:55,929
recombination and predicted based on the

235
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:58,659
model as opposed to actual field trials

236
00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:01,239
of that particular line what that means

237
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:04,389
is that in the process of line

238
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,970
development after a cross is made and

239
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:09,309
the plants begin to grow even at the

240
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,860
seedling stage a very young glance

241
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:14,859
before we can have any estimate of yield

242
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:18,370
we can take an a sampling of the leaves

243
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:22,120
and do the genotypic information marker

244
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:24,399
analysis using DNA methodology use the

245
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,110
models predict what it's reading value

246
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,319
is and then make decisions on which

247
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:31,779
lines to use as parents for the next

248
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,930
round based on that information it can

249
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:38,769
go much more quickly and it is actually

250
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:40,859
with the low cost of sequencing it can

251
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:45,340
be cheaper actually than doing the

252
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:47,860
phenotyping the old way so the process

253
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,820
then involves accelerating the rate at

254
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,500
which this cycle goes between successive

255
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:57,010
crosses and that's recombination that's

256
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,470
needed and associated with that and the

257
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:01,929
problem is that cassava has another

258
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,680
characteristic that is an obstacle and

259
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:07,689
that is it's for flowering

260
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:09,579
characteristics and that's what Peter

261
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,760
and I work on that's what we're going to

262
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:16,430
tell you about today so this is an

263
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:19,819
illustration of the type of problem

264
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:24,979
this is a survey of over 1,800 clones

265
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:28,040
assessed in Abuja Nigeria new Biaggi is

266
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:31,100
the very best location for getting good

267
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:34,849
flowering in Nigeria and it is the

268
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,690
location that the eye ITA Institute is

269
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:41,720
using as their location from doing their

270
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:44,899
process nevertheless in Obie Asha in

271
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,639
this set of 1,800 lines we look at the

272
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:49,009
flowers ability and going from zero

273
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,240
which means no flowering at all three

274
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:54,049
which is good flowering

275
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,769
only around 33% or so were good

276
00:13:54,049 --> 00:14:01,458
flowering the other 2/3 were either

277
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:05,299
medium or low flower in fact 15 or 18

278
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:07,039
percent were no flowering at all so what

279
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:09,319
that means is a lot of the favorable

280
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,719
alleles that you might wish to use in

281
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,060
order to improve the cassava is lar

282
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:18,519
locked up in lines that you really have

283
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:22,519
a lot of difficulty crossing and so by

284
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:26,319
finding ways to obtain better flowering

285
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:29,539
we have the potential of unlocking those

286
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,790
that germ plasm that could be used so

287
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:33,949
the problem is that Sabah is late

288
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:37,219
flowering takes a long time to induce

289
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:39,110
flowering maybe 4 to 9 months and some

290
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,370
lines not at all they will not flower

291
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:45,680
within the one year time frame flowering

292
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:49,278
among parents that you want to cross is

293
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:52,009
often not synchronous so we're just at

294
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:54,289
the mercy of whatever the flowering

295
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:55,939
behavior is and if they're non

296
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:58,849
synchronous that creates a big obstacle

297
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,980
to making the cross love interest we

298
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,110
have a low number of flowers produced so

299
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,730
there's one thing is the induction of

300
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,129
flowering the other is the quantity or

301
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,629
number of flowers a low percentage of

302
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:10,370
those flowers that are produced our

303
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:12,649
female flowers Peter will tell you about

304
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,320
that and finally there's a lot of

305
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:18,230
abortion or Arrested Development of the

306
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,290
flowers the fruits and the seeds in fact

307
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:25,250
each flower will potentially produce

308
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:28,099
only three seeds and oftentimes one or

309
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,938
several of one or all of those three

310
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,379
seeds do not develop because

311
00:15:29,938 --> 00:15:34,998
the rest of development so the goal of

312
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:38,369
our project is to develop a set of tools

313
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:40,649
and tools that we will define as Peter

314
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:43,139
will describe the type of work that

315
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:46,099
we've been doing a set of tools that

316
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:49,709
breeders can use conveniently in their

317
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:52,259
in their nurseries the hasten flower

318
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:54,748
induction and to increase política see

319
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:57,449
in their seedling nurseries and crossing

320
00:15:54,749 --> 00:16:01,079
blocks and we've been really pleased

321
00:15:57,448 --> 00:16:03,048
with the very great amount of progress

322
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,698
that we've been able to make in

323
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:08,278
developing a set of tools and we're now

324
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:10,078
in the conclusion of phase one where we

325
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,239
have developed tools and we're gonna

326
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,608
just enter Phase two where we put more

327
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:17,278
of our emphasis on working with breeding

328
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:21,059
programs to implement them in in

329
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:25,438
practice so back to this slide here I

330
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:27,688
just shows you again the participants

331
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:29,728
and we have representatives of each of

332
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:32,698
these institutions who work with this on

333
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:34,139
the flowering program we do work under

334
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:36,958
controlled conditions like greenhouse

335
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:39,178
and growth chamber and then we depend on

336
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,868
them primarily to do the field studies

337
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:45,328
and Cornell Peter and I are going to be

338
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:47,579
telling you about the story Sarah a demo

339
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:50,219
just finished a pH I posted that earlier

340
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:52,048
this year and there's a little bit of

341
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,569
information we'll provide from her work

342
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:57,028
shangguan you may remember she finished

343
00:16:54,568 --> 00:17:00,719
a master's degree about one year ago and

344
00:16:57,028 --> 00:17:04,199
devorah a day is a PhD student with me

345
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,889
currently she's located at iit a and

346
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,199
working on the program as we speak so I

347
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:12,240
think that's the last of my slides and

348
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,169
this is where I asked the baton over to

349
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,169
Peter

350
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,409
that's not alright good

351
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:25,689
well thank you for giving me the

352
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:27,369
opportunity to share some of the work

353
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:30,190
that we've been doing I'm I find this

354
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:34,269
project really exciting she's gonna be

355
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:36,570
beneficial in the long run and it's yeah

356
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:41,109
it's gonna really fun five years I

357
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:42,460
wanted to start out by showing some

358
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:44,109
pictures and just giving a little

359
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,399
background on what cassava flowers are

360
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:47,469
like because I'm gonna be showing you a

361
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:51,219
lot of data and make sure that it's

362
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,210
understandable cassava this is a cassava

363
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,720
inflorescence

364
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,788
it starts out producing a few female

365
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,600
flowers these are open female flowers

366
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:05,618
and usually about ten percent of all of

367
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,219
the flowers are female second come the

368
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:08,048
males

369
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:12,808
these are unopened male flowers at this

370
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:15,638
point and they flower at a forking event

371
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:17,829
so the apical meristem grows and then it

372
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:21,788
branches there's two fork branches and

373
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:25,449
at that point they flower demonstration

374
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:28,528
here's our cassava field and this is

375
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:31,269
what some grow they grow up they flower

376
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:34,690
they fork they grow up again a little

377
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:37,149
bit further mmm a flower again we call

378
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:40,090
this the first tier flowering and then

379
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:42,969
this is second tier flowering generally

380
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:45,249
you get better flower development on the

381
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,200
second third maybe fourth tier and then

382
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:49,358
it starts to taper off but you get very

383
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,028
little development of flowers on the

384
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:55,778
first year sometimes they grow like this

385
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:58,778
though and you get no flower development

386
00:18:55,778 --> 00:19:01,239
on any of the tiers I I say no

387
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:02,950
development it does grow at very very

388
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:05,048
small inflorescence less than a

389
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,080
centimeter and then of sizes and falls

390
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:10,160
off so no open flower is no possibility

391
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,079
of pollination

392
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,019
sometimes they also grow like this for a

393
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:17,059
very long time and then fork and other

394
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:20,720
times they just keep growing and growing

395
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:24,529
and growing and you get no forking no

396
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,880
flower development it's actually kind of

397
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:29,149
interesting too because this is a

398
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,430
desired trait in some areas which is

399
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,980
like a breeders nightmare breeding for a

400
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:36,170
trait that makes it really hard to breed

401
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:39,980
so that's something that we if we can

402
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:42,529
stimulate artificially a plant that

403
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,809
grows like this to flower but then it

404
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:47,990
you know in the field and growers fields

405
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:51,649
that will still be like this so this

406
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:53,750
variability is seen across genotypes and

407
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,670
environments so you might have one

408
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:58,279
genotype that flowers very well another

409
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,570
genotype is flowers very poorly you

410
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:02,029
might have a genotype that flowers very

411
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:06,799
well in one location very poorly in

412
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:08,299
another location so this is where we've

413
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,269
really first got started the

414
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:12,980
environmental factors and two

415
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:16,309
environmental factors that are well

416
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,049
known to regulate flower and influence

417
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:21,139
flower development its temperature and

418
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:23,210
photo period and other crops and these

419
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,670
also interact with each other so that's

420
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:30,650
where we started and now I'm gonna get

421
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:32,360
into some of this our data I'll explain

422
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,940
this very piece a little slower the

423
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:36,079
first time you'll see this chart many

424
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,900
times because this is how we represent

425
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,899
the age of flowering or percentage

426
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:46,160
flowering and most of our work um so

427
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:50,120
that x-axis here is age in days and the

428
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,769
y-axis is the percent forking this does

429
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:53,419
not mean that they produced a large

430
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:55,579
inflorescence it just means they got to

431
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,830
the point of forking and a lot of times

432
00:20:55,579 --> 00:21:01,099
that we're happy with that at this point

433
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:03,109
and so we have three different

434
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:05,389
temperatures these were grown in growth

435
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:11,269
chambers here at Cornell and what we saw

436
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:14,960
was at a very warm temperature 34c only

437
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:17,420
about 22% actually got to the point of

438
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,450
forking a more moderate twenty-eight we

439
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,450
saw 75% forking and attic this is a very

440
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:27,769
cool temperature for cassava 22

441
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:29,990
we saw 96% for this is at the first tier

442
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:33,288
second tier we see a very similar

443
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:37,669
pattern so it really indicates the

444
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:41,148
temperature is critical to flowering or

445
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:44,120
forking we also saw that at the two

446
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:47,989
lower temperatures there was an increase

447
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:50,118
in floral development so this graph here

448
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,519
is a

449
00:21:50,118 --> 00:21:54,618
the days after floral initiation so

450
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:57,078
after forking and then this is the

451
00:21:54,618 --> 00:22:00,228
number of flowers that are present on

452
00:21:57,078 --> 00:22:04,519
the inflorescence over time and so what

453
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:06,619
we see is that at 28 you get some

454
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:10,068
increase in floral development and then

455
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:13,068
at 22 you get quite a bit more floral

456
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:15,199
development and your the 34 is not on

457
00:22:13,068 --> 00:22:17,449
this because those never even forked so

458
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:20,739
I can't show any data regarding the

459
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:24,139
number of flowers that were developed

460
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:25,818
another question you might have is so

461
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:27,858
are the plants just really unhealthy at

462
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:31,068
warm temperatures because 34 is pretty

463
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:34,908
warm and no actually cassava here it

464
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:35,989
grows very well at 34 vegetatively and

465
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:38,929
at 22

466
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:40,608
it is much shorter but it's a healthy

467
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:43,419
plant and you can see the forking and

468
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:43,418
flowering

469
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:50,329
the next thing we wanted to look at was

470
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:53,920
a photo period so the way we do our

471
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:53,919
photo period experiments is you have

472
00:22:54,099 --> 00:23:00,409
regular grow lights for maybe ten hours

473
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:03,140
and then we do a dim light extension we

474
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:06,050
use that not photosynthetic radiation so

475
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:11,810
that they're more comparable we used red

476
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:13,909
lights red LEDs in fact because look at

477
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:18,169
this chart here this is the red the

478
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:22,460
spectrum of the red LED and it is the

479
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:25,070
max is about 640 which aligns better to

480
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:28,970
the phytochrome which is the pigment

481
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:32,710
that absorbs red light and stimulate

482
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:37,190
flowering the white LEDs you see air

483
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:38,960
shifted away from the spectrum that's

484
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:45,610
more beneficial for flowering and for

485
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:48,250
absorption by cytochrome so with the

486
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:51,319
long day extension and this is that

487
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:53,509
moderately cool temperature 25 we saw

488
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:58,819
that long days stimulates earlier

489
00:23:53,509 --> 00:24:04,129
flowering you see here the at 10 hour

490
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:08,809
day it's about 40% and at a 14 hour day

491
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:11,300
we're up to about 80% and this data is

492
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:13,369
representing four different genotypes

493
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:16,159
most of the work we do we have four

494
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:18,169
different genotypes some are late

495
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,150
flowering or poor flowering and some are

496
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:23,240
early flowering and somewhere in the

497
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:27,470
middle so this is a means of all of

498
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:31,700
those combined men at warmer

499
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:35,539
temperatures so at 30 degrees Celsius we

500
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:37,610
see also a benefit of long day in terms

501
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:40,039
of flowering that flowering the

502
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:42,169
percentage of flowering goes up but it's

503
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:44,149
not as pronounced is that the cooler

504
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,279
temperature which goes along with the

505
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,450
fact that the first experiments we did

506
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:50,859
with temperature showing the temperature

507
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,860
inhibits flowering

508
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:57,529
then we also wanted to look at more

509
00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:01,130
interactions between photo period and

510
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:03,259
temperature so and this was done as

511
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,900
opposed to a short and long day we

512
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:07,549
wanted to look at more what field grown

513
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,610
plants would be which would be 12 hours

514
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:13,069
and see if we just by going from 12 up

515
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:14,479
to 16 you're also seeing a benefit this

516
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:18,849
would be more what's going to happen in

517
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,349
the field and indeed we did so this is a

518
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:25,189
cool temperature and warm temperature at

519
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:28,730
the warm temperature of 30 or 35 day 30

520
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:34,460
night we see no flower initiation at 12

521
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:37,700
hours but with long with cool

522
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,440
temperatures cool temperatures at 12

523
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,319
hours we see some initiation of

524
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:48,320
flowering and cool temperature at long

525
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:49,939
day even better flowering so now I'm

526
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,519
going to step us to hide and this is a

527
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,370
little bit this is some work that Sarah

528
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:58,220
Eddie amo spearheaded looking at Ft

529
00:25:55,369 --> 00:26:02,629
because it ties into the photo period ft

530
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,970
is a relatively new discovery that is

531
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:09,230
the FT gene is responsible for flower

532
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:14,329
induction and she identified 2 ft like

533
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:17,809
genes in cassava the model is that the

534
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:20,269
photo period stimulates long day

535
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:23,359
stimulates ft expression in the leaves

536
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:25,039
it's transported by the phloem to the

537
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,659
apical meristem or the flowering region

538
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,399
and stimulates flowering and this is

539
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:32,900
common in a lot of different crops and

540
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,310
we looked at the plants we were growing

541
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,360
in the photo in the different photo

542
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:42,159
periods and indeed one of the FT genes

543
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:45,049
ft2 was expressed at a higher level

544
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,380
under long days so it's indicating that

545
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:52,579
the ft is responsible or partially

546
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:54,020
responsible for the flowering some the

547
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:57,109
improvement in flowering that we're

548
00:26:54,019 --> 00:27:00,720
seeing under long day under photo period

549
00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:03,599
experiments so then conclude

550
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,329
for the photo period and temperature we

551
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:10,798
see that cooler temperatures hasten

552
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:12,899
flowering and warm reduce flowering long

553
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:16,349
days also decrease the time to flowering

554
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,570
and high temperature will reduce or

555
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:20,730
eliminate that long day effect so if you

556
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:25,139
have even with the long day if it's very

557
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:28,380
hot it will not flower and the low

558
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,090
wattage LEDs are effective for

559
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,539
stimulating flowering and this is

560
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:36,029
important when we get into field work we

561
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:44,220
wanted to have more efficient lights for

562
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:47,069
a field the next thing we were wanted to

563
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,100
look at was plant growth regulators and

564
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:52,950
I we don't have to study this in detail

565
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:55,168
but I put this up here because often I

566
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,370
explain to people that we use a few

567
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:57,929
compounds and they say well how did you

568
00:27:56,369 --> 00:27:58,979
know that those particular compounds

569
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:01,650
were going to work and the fact that

570
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,829
matter is we had no idea we took a

571
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:07,530
shotgun approach and tested lots and

572
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:09,869
lots of plant growth regulators and we

573
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:12,089
tested them here at Cornell and then our

574
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:15,658
colleagues in Africa also worked on them

575
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:16,980
and lots of different compounds

576
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:21,030
different combinations different

577
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:23,610
concentrations and we found in the end

578
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:25,980
that there is two that are very

579
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:28,189
important to flowering cytokinins

580
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:33,029
and we're using the synthetic da and

581
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:36,210
then ethylene and we're both show work

582
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:38,730
with ethylene with STS which is silver

583
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,590
thiosulfate which blocks the ethylene

584
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:43,860
receptor and renders the plant

585
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:46,500
insensitive ethylene and then Etha Fon

586
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:48,479
which is a compound that's absorbed by

587
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,409
the plant and quickly metabolized into

588
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,409
ethylene

589
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,298
it reduces flowering

590
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:03,539
so silver thiosulfate like I said it

591
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:06,059
blocks the ethylene receptor and here's

592
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:09,930
our water control zoom in for you

593
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:12,750
there's this is what I mean by basically

594
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:14,220
no flower it's less than a centimeter

595
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,839
long you can see it's already turning

596
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,000
straw colored it's upsizing it's going

597
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,789
to fall off in a couple days and then

598
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,910
with applications spray application of

599
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:26,159
silver thiosulfate we see this enormous

600
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,650
in fluorescence developed so this is

601
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,450
really great and here's a graphical

602
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:33,509
representation of the data we saw and

603
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,880
this is just one concentration we tested

604
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:38,059
a few different concentrations and we

605
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,850
saw that with increased concentration

606
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:43,679
increased benefit so here this is water

607
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:48,109
control and then going up to 1

608
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,110
millimolar we got the best benefit

609
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:55,459
so that was great but it didn't work

610
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:57,470
very well in the field so we started

611
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,440
testing a lot of different ways to apply

612
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:02,360
us to yes we had a brainstormed a lot of

613
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,009
different why this wouldn't work in the

614
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:06,439
field maybe the leaves developed a

615
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:08,150
thicker waxy cuticle maybe the rain is

616
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,799
just washing the SPS off and it takes a

617
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,840
long time to be absorbed we tried some

618
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:13,819
different adjuvants we tried rain

619
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,730
sticker that helps the plant basically

620
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:20,210
bluesier substance choice onto the

621
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,650
leaves we increase the humidity of the

622
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,980
leaves trying to keep the stomata open

623
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:26,300
by putting bags over the tops of plants

624
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,870
they all some worked a little bit but

625
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:32,869
what we really found works well is this

626
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:36,469
application using petiole feeding so the

627
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:38,239
way this works is you can cut a leaf off

628
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,000
and then there's negative pressure

629
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,440
inside the plant and so if you quickly

630
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,559
cut the leaf off and put it into a

631
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,620
solution it will take up that solution

632
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:51,859
through the vascular bundles this STS is

633
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:54,799
not red this is just to explain and I

634
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:57,889
was using this as a tracer and so it is

635
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,869
absorbing the red liquid and then you

636
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,420
can see the vascular bundles if you cut

637
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:05,959
off that petiole rather quickly it a

638
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:07,700
couple hours it will be absorbed we also

639
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,340
cut this plant up quite a bit more and

640
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:13,100
saw that it mostly goes up in the plants

641
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:15,769
to the apical region so this is a pretty

642
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:18,469
effective way of applying s yes and we

643
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:20,569
again tested a few different

644
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,130
concentrations and saw that with

645
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:25,220
increased concentration up to a certain

646
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:31,460
point we see increased benefit in the

647
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:33,019
floral development okay so this this one

648
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,259
I need to slow down for a little bit

649
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:40,250
because it's a little complicated but

650
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:42,500
it's really exciting so what we wanted

651
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,960
to make sure was that STS was having

652
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:48,740
effect on ethylene and it's not just

653
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,779
some extraneous factor of silver being

654
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:54,829
in the plant that's causing the

655
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:57,529
flowering so we have two different

656
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:59,359
treatments over a course of time so at

657
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:01,668
first we started out by either treating

658
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:05,388
plants the water control or

659
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:08,089
with silver and these flowers were

660
00:32:05,388 --> 00:32:10,398
already developed so this is unlike what

661
00:32:08,088 --> 00:32:12,739
we're doing the past this is a high

662
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:15,588
flowering genotype we used flowers were

663
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:19,548
already there we sprayed them with water

664
00:32:15,588 --> 00:32:22,578
or we sprayed them with STS then we

665
00:32:19,548 --> 00:32:24,679
waited a little while and then of the

666
00:32:22,578 --> 00:32:26,749
water controls half of them we sprayed

667
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,119
with SF on and half of them we did not

668
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:31,459
and of the plants that we've treated

669
00:32:29,118 --> 00:32:32,689
with STS also half of them we spray -

670
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:35,298
that's a faun and half of them we did

671
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:40,278
not and if you look at this the graph

672
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:43,519
over here so we have I plan it's not

673
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:45,858
sprayed with STS and they have a decent

674
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,419
amount of flowers and then not spray -

675
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:50,058
that's a fine so no difference this is

676
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:53,028
our water control plants sprayed with

677
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:55,038
STS and then without s ofon again

678
00:32:53,028 --> 00:32:56,898
there's no real difference STS is not

679
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:58,038
negatively influenced at flowers or

680
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:59,678
positive because these are already

681
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:03,019
developed flowers

682
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,149
if we don't spray with STS of water and

683
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:07,459
then we spray with F on it knocks all

684
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:09,738
those flowers off over the course this

685
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:12,139
is a about five days in between these

686
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:15,979
two treatments and then if we spray with

687
00:33:12,138 --> 00:33:18,498
STS and then we spray with esif on the

688
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:20,690
SGS protects the plant from the s pathan

689
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:23,899
response and none of the flowers fall

690
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:26,509
off so this makes it pretty clear to us

691
00:33:23,898 --> 00:33:29,328
that yes yes is affecting s Athan it's

692
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:32,108
or ethylene in the plant and it's an

693
00:33:29,328 --> 00:33:32,108
ethylene response

694
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:41,250
so I also said we worked with cytokinin

695
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,819
ba again showing you a lot of these

696
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:48,720
controls no no flowers but and we saw

697
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:53,369
that bi had a slight beneficial effect

698
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,470
on flowering alone but it was it was not

699
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:58,169
as good as s yes so initially we weren't

700
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:00,440
that excited about it but we we kept

701
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:02,930
being intrigued

702
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,420
but then what we saw was that the

703
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:09,110
combination of STS and BA there's a

704
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:11,659
synergistic effect and we get these very

705
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:14,150
large inflorescences developed this is

706
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:17,389
really exciting we're better than the

707
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:19,250
SDS so this is this looks really great

708
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:22,250
for us

709
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:25,070
and here is a graphical representation

710
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:28,489
you can see that the water control and

711
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:30,559
then we have STS alone VA alone but then

712
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:33,619
with the combination multiplicative

713
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:39,559
effect and it's it's much greater than

714
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:42,109
the sum of the two so that was by was

715
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:46,219
wonderful but it gets better I can't

716
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:49,579
believe it Kenya so who would go back to

717
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:52,428
this picture of I showed you before and

718
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:54,799
what I'm gonna point out to you is like

719
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:57,110
I said earlier typical flowering you get

720
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,090
a few females here you can see this is

721
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:03,940
actually fruit developing and then males

722
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:07,910
up at the top zoom in oh I went ahead

723
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:09,440
what we see is that with us guess alone

724
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:13,579
you get males on the top this is a

725
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,579
typical ratio but with BA it's all

726
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:20,719
females the entire inflorescence is

727
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:23,059
females so we have about 150 female

728
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,339
flowers on this for a breeder who's

729
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:34,400
trying to get seed this is actually very

730
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:37,789
very useful data it goes along with this

731
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,460
that we can see hey we get a slight

732
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:47,599
increase of ba and STS but then with the

733
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:50,210
two almost 100% females we wanted to

734
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,339
look more into this and when when do we

735
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:56,090
need to apply this ba to get this shift

736
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:59,720
and what we did here was we have control

737
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:02,960
and then the STS and Oba and then VA 14

738
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:05,899
days before any visible flowering at

739
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,400
flowering and then 14 days after and

740
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,309
what we see is you really have to get

741
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,110
that application to be a on before you

742
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:15,049
can even see any flowering so it

743
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:17,000
indicates that the transition to females

744
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:21,080
is happens very early in floral

745
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,320
development but you actually do see a

746
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:26,569
benefit in floral development applying

747
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,730
the at flowering or a little bit after

748
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:32,920
flowering but it just you don't get the

749
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,920
massive shift to mostly females

750
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:39,619
so in conclusion for our plant growth

751
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,800
regulators we see that foliar

752
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:45,589
applications of SDS can increase the

753
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,470
quantity of flowers STS protects the

754
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:51,880
flower from ethylene applying through

755
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:51,879
the petiole is effective

756
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:58,039
combination of bas GS is much more

757
00:36:55,639 --> 00:37:01,900
effective and that BA increases the

758
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:01,900
percentage of female flowers

759
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:09,139
one of the last topics I'm going to

760
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:10,789
touch on is pruning so pruning is people

761
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:12,980
have done this a lot where you can

762
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:16,400
manipulate source ink relationships and

763
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:20,599
plants by by removing parts by cutting

764
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,750
them off our colleague in Colombia

765
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,699
Hernan Ceballos started doing a little

766
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:29,110
work on this and we he mentioned it to

767
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:32,480
us and we carried on with it also and

768
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:34,660
what we do is when the plant is very

769
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,349
young so earlier than this stage and

770
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:41,659
these lateral fork branches are less

771
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:45,769
than a half a centimeter long so very

772
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:48,139
small there's three branches usually and

773
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:50,570
then inflorescence is also less than a

774
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:53,750
half a centimeter long you cut those

775
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:56,210
branches off so you get in there with a

776
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:58,730
magnifying glass and scalpel them pop

777
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:03,139
them off and then you get a nice

778
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:04,699
inflorescence develops this was really

779
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:07,579
cool so no plant growth regulator is

780
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:09,980
needed and you get a huge inflorescence

781
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:11,840
at the first year which the first year

782
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,789
normally doesn't produce many flowers

783
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:18,140
even in a high flowering genotype and so

784
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:20,599
this can really push the time to get

785
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:21,170
flowers and to get seed quite a bit

786
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:25,190
faster

787
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:28,970
a breeding nursery we decided to take it

788
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:31,340
one step further and see if ba would

789
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:35,029
have the same feminization effect as we

790
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:39,980
saw with the sts and it sure does you

791
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:42,320
get about a hundred percent females so

792
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:45,530
here's the data I'm showing that you get

793
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,800
a increase with both pruning and pruning

794
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,800
NBA

795
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:55,550
so the next phase as Tim mentioned is

796
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:57,349
going to be we've kind of developed a

797
00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:00,890
tool box and trying to disseminate this

798
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:04,239
information out to breeders we've been

799
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:07,839
doing some trips and trying to develop

800
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:10,750
red light setups so we can stimulate

801
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:14,300
basically mimic long days in the field

802
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,139
using LEDs is really nice because

803
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,269
they're low-energy

804
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:19,969
and these will probably be set up on

805
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:23,469
solar systems solar powered so they can

806
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:27,618
be put in any field working with people

807
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:29,539
like Simon Peter here to do some PGR

808
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:32,890
applications in the field and working

809
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:35,179
with the folks like Smith who are

810
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:38,539
actually he leads all the crossing at

811
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:39,618
IIT a for the most part so not so much

812
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:41,090
with the breeders both the people that

813
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:42,769
are actually doing the work doing the

814
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:45,950
crossing how can they best utilize this

815
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:48,639
information and benefit their there

816
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:48,639
crossing the best

817
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:56,180
so in conclusion just a few things we

818
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:58,818
saw that long day is beneficial cool

819
00:39:56,179 --> 00:40:00,649
temperatures around 25 or the seem to be

820
00:39:58,818 --> 00:40:04,489
the best that's kind of difficult to

821
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:09,108
manipulate in the field SPS ba are great

822
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:11,058
for improving flowering and pruning also

823
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:13,639
works some of the challenges are this

824
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:15,859
the STS in the field we haven't seen as

825
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:18,048
good of benefit as we have seen in the

826
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:21,739
greenhouse so trying to work on that and

827
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:23,719
then for phase 2 really optimizing these

828
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:25,578
methods for the field developing the

829
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:27,828
best applications for them assessing

830
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:29,690
fruit and seed set in the field as

831
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:31,339
they're doing the pollination making

832
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:36,880
sure this these methods work with

833
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:41,119
crossing the developing field scale

834
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:44,450
photo period extension field testing of

835
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,470
the pruning best combinations because

836
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:49,129
there's a lot of different combinations

837
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:50,989
you can do probably doing some of the

838
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,420
photo period extension with the PD ours

839
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:56,899
will have I'm guessing that's where

840
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:59,030
we'll probably end up going and doing

841
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:03,650
workshops that training people how to

842
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:05,450
use these this technology so thank you

843
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,490
all for paying attention and I hope this

844
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:07,818
I find this really exciting hope you do

845
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:10,548
too

846
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:16,920
and I'd like to thank our partners and

847
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:22,438
our donors wouldn't be possible so

848
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,438
[Applause]

849
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:35,279
any questions I agree very exciting even

850
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:39,860
so my question is maybe a procedure but

851
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:44,519
Tim additionally talking about using

852
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:46,950
phenotyping of a training set to kind of

853
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:49,920
predict certain properties and related

854
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:53,339
to genotypic information and then your

855
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:57,869
later on you're manipulating the feed on

856
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:59,789
typical features is that an issue in in

857
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:06,719
terms of the broader program where you

858
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:11,309
do the phenotype much earlier on so the

859
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:14,069
phenotyping on the training set is a set

860
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:17,039
of coins representative of the breeding

861
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:20,910
population at large and it's done

862
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:24,179
without making any crosses the breeding

863
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:26,940
program requires the crossing in order

864
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:31,109
to get recombination and favourable

865
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:33,450
alleles brought in together so that is

866
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:36,829
done on this right hand half of that

867
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:40,739
diagram where you would wish to do that

868
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:45,360
cycling as quickly as possible and the

869
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:48,269
genome tipic r GS scientific selection

870
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:51,269
allows you to have a model that's

871
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:54,750
developed to relate the performance

872
00:42:51,269 --> 00:43:01,219
let's say the yield and the markers that

873
00:42:54,750 --> 00:43:03,840
are marking and sampling a genome the

874
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:08,329
sequence that's a single nucleotide

875
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:12,570
position be able to model that and then

876
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:14,940
from the the progeny that are produced

877
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:18,900
at each turn of the cycle you're going

878
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:22,110
to do several thousand lines analyze

879
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:25,680
them by DNA analysis and then from that

880
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:27,990
DNA information you will be able to

881
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,359
predict what their breeding values are

882
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:31,409
whether they would be good parents to

883
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:35,099
select in

884
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:39,949
the next round of crossing so we're

885
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:43,950
we're what we're needed for is to help

886
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:47,250
take young plants and get them to flower

887
00:43:43,949 --> 00:43:50,250
as quickly as possible and in numbers of

888
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:52,469
flowers as many as possible so that when

889
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:56,010
they have selected desirable parents

890
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:59,368
they can make the desired crosses on a

891
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:01,710
timely schedule and in fact in some

892
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:04,950
cases there are lines that they would

893
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:08,608
like to use but they don't flower at all

894
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:11,689
under conventional conditions I don't

895
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:16,828
know I hope that helps I understand that

896
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:19,650
different ages of the whole program we

897
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:23,400
get the question a lot well aren't you

898
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:26,220
going to harm the farmers yield

899
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,410
potential no we're only working in the

900
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:31,558
nursery with these tools this is a

901
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:34,769
Breeders toolbox the farmers will not

902
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:37,910
have an altered flowering plant if all

903
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:40,858
goes unless the breeding selection

904
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:43,230
resulted in in fact in our case it's

905
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:46,288
likely that we would be selecting for

906
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:48,358
low flowering lines more so than under

907
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:54,710
conventional conditions so it won't

908
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:54,710
affect what the farmer will have as a

909
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:21,169
I'll take that question and the question

910
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:23,420
is whether there has been enough

911
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:25,369
information collected to evaluate

912
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:28,180
whether the process of genomic selection

913
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:30,920
and the model development is effective

914
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:33,440
we did not talk about that part of the

915
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,990
story and in fact there have been a

916
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,360
series of seminars primarily in the lamp

917
00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:42,649
reading seminar program where jean-luc

918
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:46,910
and shadows e GC and others and several

919
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:48,289
students of PhD students have gone

920
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:50,629
through the program and have also

921
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:53,630
presented but the answer to your

922
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:58,130
question is that yes there's evidence

923
00:45:53,630 --> 00:46:00,200
that it is working is it a two-fold

924
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:03,500
10-fold no it's not that kind of thing

925
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:05,419
it's a quantitative trait reading a

926
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:09,460
breeding for yield which is one of the

927
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:15,349
primary targets is a process that is

928
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:18,530
going to result in steady but relatively

929
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:20,539
small improvements over time you're

930
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:25,850
talking one to ten percent one to five

931
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:30,619
percent increase per cycle it's so it is

932
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:33,110
working and so we're encouraged to go to

933
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:44,989
this phase two which we're just entering

934
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:48,650
now variation in terms of flowering

935
00:46:44,989 --> 00:46:50,929
between different cassava lines so your

936
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:55,820
date that implied that if we have this

937
00:46:50,929 --> 00:47:02,449
creation is due to endogenous like high

938
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:04,730
clobbering lines have low and highly

939
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:07,029
excited so have you murdered have you

940
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,030
done

941
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:18,319
[Music]

942
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:20,960
show that you know planet that we're not

943
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:30,370
treating does ethylene know know what

944
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:34,490
they want so in the lines of high

945
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:36,380
flowering potential but wait a bit of

946
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:38,539
variation in terms of how much hours are

947
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:41,000
produced so what they wonder whether

948
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:43,820
this variation between lines can be also

949
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,760
do for this inherent ability of this

950
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,890
line to produce for example those line

951
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,980
which consistently produce lots of

952
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:54,980
flowers they actually produce less like

953
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:57,619
there was like initially yes that's a

954
00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:00,490
very good point and we haven't measured

955
00:47:57,619 --> 00:48:04,789
ethylene production across genotypes

956
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:07,369
this point but it should perceive the

957
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:10,509
could not be that what little we have

958
00:48:07,369 --> 00:48:15,500
down and this was when Shangguan was a

959
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:17,180
master's student and she tried a few

960
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:20,530
different lines there wasn't that

961
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:27,469
particular factor the ethylene was not

962
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:29,000
the key differentiating property so I'd

963
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:32,689
say that's not terribly surprising

964
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,030
because you have really in in the

965
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:38,480
process of signaling for both flower

966
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:40,250
induction and for flower set quite a lot

967
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,740
of different things that could be

968
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:45,590
genetically different between lines and

969
00:48:42,739 --> 00:48:49,149
so that at least in the lines that she

970
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:52,940
surveyed very small 419 and triple 0 to

971
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:55,910
that wasn't the key thing similarly when

972
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:58,340
we look at the FT production while the

973
00:48:55,909 --> 00:49:01,519
genotypic I mean they've been a photo

974
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:07,390
period excuse me photo period difference

975
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:11,119
in the FT to transcript levels was

976
00:49:07,389 --> 00:49:13,609
showing very clear relationship to photo

977
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:16,519
period if we look at the genotype

978
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:20,300
differences that transcript abundance

979
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:23,539
alone wasn't a good predictor so clearly

980
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,930
there's many other components of a

981
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:25,789
signal

982
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:28,579
pathway that could be different between

983
00:49:25,789 --> 00:49:31,099
lines that could be responsible for the

984
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:34,960
overall outcome it hasn't been our

985
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:37,819
objective to do a complete and thorough

986
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,829
investigation of what causes these

987
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:42,559
things we've been very much in the

988
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:45,409
applied science mode where we're looking

989
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:48,679
for this toolbox things that will work

990
00:49:45,409 --> 00:49:50,809
for the readers sadly as a physiologist

991
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:53,929
we have not been given the

992
00:49:50,809 --> 00:49:56,289
responsibility to pursue molecular

993
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:56,289
physiology

994
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:30,278
would be formally propagated crop and

995
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:32,909
once it's released as a clone then it

996
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:32,909
will stay the same

997
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:42,848
well it should say the same it has pros

998
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:45,639
and cons I mean you do fix the genotype

999
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:48,160
by your cloning because it's clonally

1000
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:50,078
propagated crop that can be an advantage

1001
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:53,170
once you have created something that's

1002
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:55,239
valuable it stays it can be propagated

1003
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:58,420
and kept the same over many many years

1004
00:50:55,239 --> 00:51:01,719
in many locations it does have the

1005
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:12,579
obstacles in the breeding process what I

1006
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:14,679
would consider challenges well yes but

1007
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:17,048
that's part of the conventional

1008
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:19,448
agriculture in a clone we propagated

1009
00:51:17,048 --> 00:51:21,969
from in the case of cassava what it

1010
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:23,889
entailed there is this issue of once a

1011
00:51:21,969 --> 00:51:26,679
breeding program has developed something

1012
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:29,170
superior and they're ready to release it

1013
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:32,288
then there needs to be a propagation

1014
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:34,269
process at IIT a they've been

1015
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:37,390
experimenting they have a nice method

1016
00:51:34,268 --> 00:51:40,868
for doing this in a kind of semi tissue

1017
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:43,748
culture it's more explant culture under

1018
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:46,630
aseptic conditions and then when I was

1019
00:51:43,748 --> 00:51:50,139
there for example they had thousands of

1020
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:52,568
little boxes sort of plexiglass they

1021
00:51:50,139 --> 00:51:54,129
would ship it out to Catholic Charities

1022
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:56,108
and then Catholic Charities in turn

1023
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:58,059
would plant them out where the plants

1024
00:51:56,108 --> 00:52:00,909
would be grown for one cycle and you get

1025
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:04,449
a process going where you can quickly

1026
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:07,058
amplify or propagate to large scale for

1027
00:52:04,449 --> 00:52:09,009
a release similar things have to happen

1028
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:11,410
in any breeding program where you go

1029
00:52:09,009 --> 00:52:13,480
from initial small little hand

1030
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:15,608
full of seed - you want to have now

1031
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,568
thousands of bushels if you read the

1032
00:52:15,608 --> 00:52:21,308
story about Norman Borlaug taking

1033
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:22,900
releasing lines in India you know that's

1034
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:24,430
a really big part of the whole process

1035
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,829
and then cassava it's especially

1036
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:30,159
challenging because it is it's

1037
00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:34,690
vegetative propagation but it is it's

1038
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:36,969
doable and it just requires some you

1039
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:39,579
know have some resources let's say the

1040
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:42,219
voters without but there is the

1041
00:52:39,579 --> 00:52:45,700
advantage that once it's released then

1042
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:47,949
it can be shared with neighbors and it's

1043
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:51,009
always identical and it can be

1044
00:52:47,949 --> 00:52:55,679
disseminated and spread if it's a it's

1045
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:55,680
unacceptable and highly desirable

1046
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:02,890
question you mentioned in your kind of

1047
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:08,530
future vision that you were planning on

1048
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:10,690
saying red light with PG are together if

1049
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:19,569
you've done any initial Studies on that

1050
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:22,960
and is it synergistic small studies and

1051
00:53:19,568 --> 00:53:24,400
shown that I wouldn't say it's

1052
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,099
synergistic but they do work together

1053
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,608
well especially what you said the red

1054
00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:31,809
light and the like yes yes those are

1055
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:33,519
kind of two different factors because

1056
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:35,019
one is dealing with the timing of

1057
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,028
flowering and one is dealing with

1058
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:38,710
flowering abundance and we did want to

1059
00:53:37,028 --> 00:53:41,199
make sure that you know it still works

1060
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:43,028
under the red lights and it does but we

1061
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,848
didn't identify really a synergistic

1062
00:53:43,028 --> 00:53:49,858
effect that is the sort of thing that

1063
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:53,829
for example turned on Sebelius at SIA is

1064
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:56,278
actively working on as well as our

1065
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:56,278
colleagues

1066
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:17,030
we'd like to see that kind of work done

1067
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:19,460
you know sort of taken out this has been

1068
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:24,310
a production of Cornell University on

1069
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:24,309
the web at Cornell edu
