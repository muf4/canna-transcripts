1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,680
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:13,839
University so uh Dr Heather Darvey is a

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:16,000
soils and agronomics specialist for ubm

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,399
extension uh Heather is involved with

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
implementing research and Outreach

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,599
programs in the area of fuel forage and

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,800
grain production systems in New England

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,359
uh her Outreach focuses on delivering on

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,759
Farm education in the areas of soil

10
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,039
Health nutrient management green and

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,480
Forge

12
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,799
production uh her research is focused on

13
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,359
traditional and nich crop variety trials

14
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,839
weed management strategies and cropping

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,479
systems uh development so I could say

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,520
that this is not the first time Heather

17
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:48,159
is presented here uh as uh she's

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,320
presented at night build meetings in the

19
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,640
past and also runs the um uh the Vermont

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,679
organic grains conference so similar

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,640
type of conference to this um maybe

22
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,119
larger and some different people but I

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,039
encourage you to check that out if

24
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,558
you've not been up before I was there

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,079
last year had a great time so uh please

26
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:11,359
help me welcome uh Dr Heather

27
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:15,519
gby um so there has been a renewed

28
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:17,319
interest in um growing oil seeds again

29
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:21,560
and I say renewed

30
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:26,359
because um it's like a decade 15 years

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:29,320
ago we had a very strong interest in oil

32
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,879
seed production but primarily focused on

33
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:37,039
producing

34
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:41,399
bofes and we had many many projects for

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:45,040
again for about 10 years focused on um

36
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:49,239
figuring out if we could produce fuel on

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,640
our Farms from field to fuel tank that's

38
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:55,919
a great on liners there um and we worked

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,920
with Farmers all over Vermont to set up

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,840
infrastructure oil

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,079
presses uh biofuel

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,000
reactors um if you want to have the

43
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:10,680
university get all worked up about

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,639
something on your per card purchase a

45
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:19,239
reactor any um and you know it was a

46
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:22,518
time when uh diesel fuel prices had gone

47
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,560
up a lot they were over $5 a gallon so

48
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,280
when that happens naturally people are

49
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,239
interested in figuring out how to cut

50
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:35,318
costs um and do things on their own like

51
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:38,719
Farmers like to do right um so we spent

52
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:42,679
again a decade trying to figure out all

53
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:46,439
the different pieces of growing your own

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:50,239
Fuel and so if these slides look like

55
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:52,800
they're from 15 years ago they are

56
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,920
actually I don't even it's not in

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,319
pptx that's how old it is anybody knows

58
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,679
what I'm talking

59
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:04,518
about I tried to update them a little

60
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:07,879
bit but it's hard to make me look 20

61
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,879
years older in

62
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:15,119
this so most of our oil seed work focus

63
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,519
on sunflowers and I know there's again

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,920
another strong interest that I've heard

65
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,120
here of about FR sunflowers I can tell

66
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:26,518
you all the things not to do which I

67
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,120
think is probably the most helpful um

68
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,438
we've also done a lot of work with

69
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,480
Canola we continue to do a lot of work

70
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:36,719
with winter canola in particular um I

71
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,158
can also tell you all the things not to

72
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,438
do

73
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:45,199
um if you don't want to be successful I

74
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:49,680
can tell you how to do that which is

75
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:52,238
good save you a ton of time years uh we

76
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,040
also did um a good amount of work with

77
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,079
flax which is on my top 10 list of crops

78
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,438
that I

79
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,760
hate I know

80
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:04,199
the other ones include hampen hops by

81
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:07,919
the

82
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:10,158
way what's that other one camelina penny

83
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,238
Crest a few others that kind of get in

84
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:17,238
that list um it is beautiful look how

85
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:20,560
beautiful it is dainty and pretty

86
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:23,679
um it's really hard to from and be

87
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,040
successful with it and um I think Peter

88
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:31,120
Martin cost you thr this how much do you

89
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,680
love f it is extremely hard to yeah okay

90
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,079
and there's there's a lot of things I

91
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,560
just like about

92
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:40,560
it okay and then hemp we've done a lot

93
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,839
of work with that for grain as well so

94
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,800
there's there's a whole number of oil

95
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:50,519
sea crops out there that you can grow um

96
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,720
that can be grown here soybeans I didn't

97
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,758
even put that one up here but soybeans

98
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,800
don't produce much oil so if you're

99
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:00,319
trying to get gallons for eer soy beans

100
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,079
aren't aren't the crop to grow

101
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,079
and if you're trying to market the oil

102
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,159
itself from a culinary perspective it's

103
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:10,800
also not really

104
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,840
that so the you know the number one oil

105
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,520
seed that we've worked with that people

106
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:18,159
have been really interested in from a

107
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:21,279
colonary perspective is

108
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,680
sunflowers plus they're really beautiful

109
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,318
and people like them and it makes people

110
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,680
smile and it builds

111
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,840
relationships and makes your neighbors

112
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,439
happy and people that drive by are happy

113
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:35,439
everybody's

114
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,600
happy right you grow the sunow you know

115
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,600
how happy it

116
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:47,159
is I'm happy I'm just looking at it you

117
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:50,519
can't see the pictures of

118
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,639
sunflowers so I'm going to focus on

119
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:57,758
growing sunflowers I think it's a a

120
00:05:53,639 --> 00:06:01,319
really appropriate prop for organic

121
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,520
production um it does take a good amount

122
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:10,199
of fertility but it's also really good

123
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:11,639
at getting it right um it's you know a

124
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,919
good propit a

125
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:18,598
rotation and it's pretty darn weak

126
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:21,079
competitive once it gets out of the

127
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:26,120
gangly teenager

128
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:29,680
stage um it doesn't seem to be as windy

129
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,160
as corn against weeds and when you're

130
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,720
combining it

131
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,560
you

132
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,400
it's they're above above most of the

133
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,720
weed so when you're you're just taking

134
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:45,519
off that yellow part there so you're not

135
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:49,400
you know trying to get down low so you

136
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:54,038
can you know the crop itself can accept

137
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,038
quite a bit of weeds and still be

138
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:59,279
successful and I hope that didn't offend

139
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,519
anybody that I'm assuming we have a lot

140
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,519
of

141
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,840
um so let's talk about seed sources the

142
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,319
seed industry itself as everybody knows

143
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:18,679
has Consolidated a lot and that includes

144
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:22,199
um the sunflower seed availability in

145
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,160
Industry um there used to be at least

146
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,478
one variety of certified organic oil

147
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,280
seeds that was available back in the day

148
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:36,318
um the Defender FL used to carry it

149
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,359
through Lake View um as far as I know

150
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,039
and if

151
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,598
someone is buying certified organic seed

152
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:47,120
somewhere you know raise your hand but

153
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:51,240
for the most part for commercially

154
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,879
available uh sunflower oil seed genetics

155
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,680
you're going to have to work with one of

156
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:59,720
these companies to get untreated seed um

157
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:04,158
new seed has always been really good to

158
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:07,000
us as far as um having seed that wasn't

159
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:09,719
treated I don't know um if anybody has

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,240
used them they used to be seeds

161
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,599
2000 years ago now it's new seed and

162
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:21,720
plus the names of their varieties so

163
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:25,079
cool Camaro Defender Cobra

164
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,280
B they are still in business they carry

165
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:31,038
a a wide range of maturities and options

166
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:33,399
and resistance to disease I think

167
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:36,278
they're a great company um and they will

168
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,599
work with you at least they did um with

169
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:41,038
me even just a year ago on getting

170
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,158
untreated seed but you really need to

171
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:47,519
get a hold of them pretty early on in

172
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:49,759
the game I think people know with the um

173
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,639
war in Ukraine and Ukraine's a big

174
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:56,439
producer of sunflowers there was um

175
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,039
sunflower shortage and then a lot of

176
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,320
people started growing sunflowers so

177
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,519
then there also was a seed I want say

178
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,040
shortage but they were selling up pretty

179
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:08,600
quick um cropland genetics always had a

180
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:12,278
lot of really good varieties again that

181
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:15,079
fit into our season here um and then of

182
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:18,039
course you have micen and p uh Pioneer

183
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:20,159
Veron they they're actually specially

184
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:22,719
raon and I don't know if you can get

185
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,679
untreated seed from them but they're

186
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,440
owned by a French company and they have

187
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:32,838
a big sunflower division as well um so

188
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,160
what maturity should you be

189
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:40,079
growing um we also did really well with

190
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:43,559
early to mid um maturing

191
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:46,239
varieties and for most people I would

192
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,319
definitely say with a mid maturing

193
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,360
variety and I'll tell you why in a

194
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,040
little bit the the later varieties

195
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,720
definitely can yield a bit more but it

196
00:09:54,039 --> 00:10:00,000
can be exceptionally difficult to get

197
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,839
them dry to harvest in the fall

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,958
so um being able to get them out of the

199
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,079
field actually in

200
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:10,559
September I would say is pretty

201
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:13,719
advisable um once you get into October

202
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,759
you know the weather it's unpredictable

203
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,320
anyway but just amount of moisture that

204
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:22,838
we get and amount of actual drawing time

205
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:26,079
um decreases a lot and um it makes it

206
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:29,959
difficult to harvest or get the crop

207
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,919
harvested okay so if you're buying seed

208
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:35,399
the one of the things to pay attention

209
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:39,159
to besides maturity is the size of the

210
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:41,559
seed so you can buy size two size three

211
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,719
or size four I don't know if you could

212
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,799
buy size five but if it does go up to

213
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,560
size

214
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,359
20 so if you think about a sunflower

215
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,958
head right you got the biggest seeds on

216
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,600
the outside and as you go into the

217
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:56,199
middle the seeds get smaller and smaller

218
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,000
and smaller and sometimes there's not

219
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,639
even viable seed in the middle of the

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,360
head so when those get harvested for

221
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:06,320
seed production they're graded and the

222
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,839
bigger twos threes and fours are what

223
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,160
kept are kept for um seed production so

224
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:16,200
size two is the biggest and then it goes

225
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:20,039
down in size and size four is

226
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,800
smallest um a lot of people would say

227
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:24,759
well size two there's more bigger

228
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,838
they're going to come of the ground

229
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:31,958
faster um there's a lot less size to

230
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,839
available to buy and there's a lot more

231
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:38,000
size

232
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:41,920
four and I think um size fours work fine

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,639
but um the big thing here is that you

234
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,879
have a corn planner or some kind of

235
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,240
planner that can handle whatever seed

236
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:50,159
size you're going to

237
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,839
buy all right I'll talk about that more

238
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,199
so this is one slide for the whole

239
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,200
presentation I just want you to

240
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,399
know uh when do you plan

241
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,639
sunflowers well you should wait till the

242
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,240
ground's

243
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,079
50° just like corn really and you know

244
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,919
the warmer the ground is the faster the

245
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:15,599
seed's going to come out

246
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:19,799
um and since you're not using treated

247
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,320
seed I would suggest that you wait um

248
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:25,159
ideally for

249
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,879
us the first full week of June was

250
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:29,600
always the best time to plant the

251
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,958
sunflowers

252
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,480
not necessarily I was the best

253
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:40,000
weather but it helped us avoid bird

254
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:44,278
damage and it also helped us avoid the

255
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,360
abandoned sunflower M which are the two

256
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:51,278
of the biggest issues that we

257
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,278
had and so it wasn't really the fact

258
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:57,759
that we couldn't plant earlier but

259
00:12:54,278 --> 00:13:01,439
planting during that week in June helped

260
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:05,319
us avoid two the major pest issues that

261
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:09,279
will be problems for you the bird will

262
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,839
be a problem and they will eat all of

263
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,639
your research

264
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,240
plots

265
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:18,240
like and most of the farmers that I've

266
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,240
worked with that have grown oil seeds

267
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,600
said figure out how much they'll eat and

268
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:28,919
plant that much for the birds and then

269
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:31,120
plant your crop so um up in Quebec low D

270
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:34,958
and that uh used to throw sunflowers out

271
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,959
there he planted 5 acres for the

272
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:42,320
birds thing they will wipe out

273
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:47,439
your all right um so you can plant with

274
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,040
a a regular corn planter all different

275
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,680
types

276
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:55,599
but you know if you're using uh like a

277
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:58,239
old finger pickup type you're going to

278
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,879
want to make sure the seeds will get

279
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,000
picked up by the fingers if you're using

280
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,078
a vacuum type and you have different

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,480
discs you're going to want to make sure

282
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:14,159
you get a sunflower disc um the seed are

283
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,560
really uh what you do you squish them

284
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,600
right you can break them pretty easy so

285
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,919
think about putting that seed through a

286
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,879
planter and how easily it can get

287
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:26,679
damaged and once it's damaged it's hard

288
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:29,120
for it to grow so if you want to get

289
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:31,479
really good populations you need to make

290
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,278
make sure that you have your planner set

291
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:38,879
up properly the right on the vacuum the

292
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:41,439
right plates the right finger pickup um

293
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,000
and I I think a lot of us learn that the

294
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,759
hard way see what's coming out it's

295
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,480
going in the ground but apparently we

296
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,759
were damaging a lot of it and we were

297
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,759
ending up with really bad STS so

298
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,839
something to consider as far as seating

299
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,600
rate

300
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,000
goes everybody will argue with me about

301
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,959
this probably nobody here but a

302
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,919
different

303
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,679
audience

304
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,799
we uh would have trouble getting stands

305
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,679
and I think some of that had to do with

306
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:13,479
the

307
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:16,559
planter um maybe sometimes the

308
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,600
conditions we generally were planning at

309
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:22,119
30,000 seeds per acre now if you go

310
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,159
online and you look at the man Manitoba

311
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,360
website or North Dakota or whatnot they

312
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:31,240
will say anywhere from like 15 to 20,000

313
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:36,519
seats per

314
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:38,879
acre it's a desert there first of all um

315
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,600
it's not really but it's dry so it's a

316
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,919
lot of dry land

317
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,720
farming um we get a lot of moisture and

318
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,879
I'll talk about what happens when you

319
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,160
have low stands and a lot of

320
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:56,159
moisture um so we can have higher

321
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:59,759
stands and I think um you your final

322
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,240
population should be around 20

323
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,519
to probably

324
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,879
28,000 but to get that final population

325
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,399
especially as you're dialing in on your

326
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:13,519
planting process whatever planner you

327
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:16,318
have you should probably seed around

328
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,480
30,000 maybe a little more per

329
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:22,679
acre um just to kind of dial things in

330
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,199
but your final population again can be

331
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:29,000
quite a bit

332
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:31,599
lower as as far as fertility goes um you

333
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,480
know it's somewhat similar to Corn needs

334
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,720
very similar amount of nitrogen uh

335
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,000
phosphorus

336
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:43,800
potassium but it's really efficient at

337
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,399
nutrient uptake has a really really deep

338
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:49,958
tap route that can pull up nutrients

339
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:53,720
from a much different depth than

340
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:56,958
corn and so I will show you some slides

341
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,480
about over fertilizing sunflowers and

342
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:03,359
what happens so so this is you know in

343
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,078
organic farming um something you need to

344
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,439
think about especially what crop you're

345
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,759
going to

346
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,038
follow the sunflowers with because you

347
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:16,919
don't want um you don't want to add too

348
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:21,160
much nitrogen you'll kill your FR and

349
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,160
I'll show you some of

350
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,318
that oh

351
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,440
jeez we'll get moving through here so

352
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:31,759
seed size and planter type I talked

353
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,160
about this whole bunch of stuff

354
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,440
different planners you can use most

355
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,558
anything really will work if you're

356
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,200
focused on planting the sunflowers

357
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:44,279
here's just a picture of you know a corn

358
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,558
planter with fingers uh what the the

359
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,519
sunflower fingers look like versus the

360
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,200
corn

361
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,798
fingers uh again about the seed size

362
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,000
number of seeds per pound sunflower

363
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:59,279
seeds U

364
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,400
expensive and um I don't how much have

365
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,279
you guys thought something I can't

366
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,038
remember what my last bag was but it's

367
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:10,359
not as expensive as cor that's like 400

368
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:14,200
but a bag size fours should have

369
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:17,918
225,000 seeds in a bag

370
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,919
roughly T

371
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:24,158
223,000 224,000 if you're planting

372
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,558
20,000 seeds per acre you can get quite

373
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,640
a few Acres out of a bag okay so

374
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:31,918
planting more seed you're going to get

375
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,960
less Acres so it'll add to your cost of

376
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,679
production but until you kind of get you

377
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,880
know moving through and figuring it out

378
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:43,320
um you know stay with a slightly higher

379
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,960
population this is a great table that's

380
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:49,879
um on the North Dakota site that really

381
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,000
talks about seed sizes planter types uh

382
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,720
vacuum pressure all that kind of stuff

383
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,679
so this is available online to kind of

384
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,558
help you get started um it does list

385
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,280
quite a few different of planners very

386
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:07,599
useful document and I can send it to

387
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:10,359
folks if you can't find it all right so

388
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:12,918
rotation if you're growing sunflowers

389
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:15,279
mostly you know folks in organic rotate

390
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:18,679
well anyway and they have diverse

391
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:21,759
rotations but it is not even advisable

392
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:24,360
to grow two years of sunflowers and I

393
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,798
will tell you firsthand that you will

394
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:29,519
see yield decline in the second year

395
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:32,240
quite a bit and this is out of Minnesota

396
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,798
um conventional production but you just

397
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,880
you got to rotate and the rotation

398
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:41,038
should be long like six years

399
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,280
minimum because they get a lot of

400
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:48,038
diseases um as far as yields go you know

401
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:53,319
we the best yields we've ever seen were

402
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:55,000
you know 5,000 pounds an acre um again

403
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:59,158
you know some years are good some years

404
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,240
are bad I think 2,000 pounds is not

405
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:05,760
unheard of and normally we would get 2

406
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,679
to 3,000 lbs and you can see varieties

407
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:12,069
you different depending on you know the

408
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,960
maturity and the variety itself and the

409
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:19,720
[Music]

410
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:24,240
genetics okay so the less plants we have

411
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:28,079
per acre is good we save money on C cost

412
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:31,400
um as an example but what we found was

413
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:34,960
that we would end up with these

414
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:39,640
ginormous sunflower heads

415
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,919
like not big but pretty big and uh

416
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,679
because we have a lot of moisture we

417
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,919
also have a lot of fertility in our

418
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,600
soils which is different than a lot of

419
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,120
places that grow

420
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,319
sunflowers and we would end up with

421
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:55,079
these humongous

422
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,798
plants which sounds great right the Y

423
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:01,678
should be the same the head's three

424
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:04,000
times the size um um less cost but it it

425
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,200
was virtually impossible to get those

426
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,880
dried down enough to actually put them

427
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,120
through the Comon so if you've ever

428
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,360
taken a sunflower head and broken it in

429
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,000
half it's like a sponge in the middle

430
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,798
right and what do sponges do when it

431
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,558
rains or when they get

432
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:25,879
wet they suck up a lot of moisture and

433
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:29,278
so we just a those huge heads we could

434
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,320
never get them dried down it was

435
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:34,440
almost

436
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:38,399
impossible um but then if it was wet and

437
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:41,120
it was late they would just hold so much

438
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,320
moisture even if the seed was dry enough

439
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:47,918
to harvest and the plant is mature that

440
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:52,359
spongy part takes forever to dry down

441
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,679
and the bigger it is the longer it takes

442
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:57,278
and so we actually found that by

443
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:00,640
increasing the populations and having

444
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:03,440
smaller plants and smaller heads it

445
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:07,640
drive down a lot faster and made

446
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:10,038
harvesting that much easier and more

447
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,520
uniform um you also have the plants at

448
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:16,679
the end of the field that like they're

449
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:18,679
huge they're semi DRS you know you bring

450
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,640
your combine in there and it's

451
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:23,759
like about throws up trying to get that

452
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,400
sunflower ed through the through the

453
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:29,400
combine anyway is that an appropriate

454
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,480
noise I saw heard that

455
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:36,200
right thank you all right so what do you

456
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:40,278
think happened

457
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:43,038
here I'm driving to the research

458
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:45,919
plot got be close to harvest let's bring

459
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:45,919
the plock on

460
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,640
by

461
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,159
no the

462
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,080
neighbors yeah they had a wedding and

463
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,039
they wanted sunflowers or their

464
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,038
daughter's wedding

465
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:07,038
no

466
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:14,559
no it's a combination of things but the

467
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:20,440
primary thing this is a nitrogen study

468
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:23,839
um there at the end of the day my

469
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,080
scientific background led me to believe

470
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:30,000
that there was too much

471
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:33,960
nitrogen and the plants Lodge they got

472
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,798
really tall and Lodge they were all

473
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,200
Lodge um and I've seen not just at this

474
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:43,720
site this was a little bit of a shocker

475
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:49,200
but seen it on farms you see them

476
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:51,600
patches on farms you know um and so too

477
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,519
much nitrogen is not a good thing with

478
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:58,918
this crop at all and it's very efficient

479
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:03,000
at taking of nitrogen

480
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:06,679
we always seem to get you know better

481
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,200
yields on our research Farms where we

482
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:13,840
had a long history of dairy manure

483
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:17,558
applications when we just didn't put

484
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:19,839
anything so you know we could definitely

485
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:21,759
go a year in sunflowers without

486
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,278
fertilizing with any nitrogen and

487
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,119
usually get really good hums but again

488
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:29,159
you have to understand what your you

489
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:32,158
know sort of background nitrogen is

490
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,278
because if you open any book from

491
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,039
anywhere else it'll tell you sunflowers

492
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:39,839
need between 100 and 200 pounds of

493
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:42,079
nitrogen you're going to get 2,000 lb

494
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,558
you need at least 100 pound of actual

495
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,879
end going into that plane which could

496
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,678
mean you know you need to put on 150 PBS

497
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,679
or maybe even more um so that's kind of

498
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,519
what we were doing and we just it was

499
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,120
hard for us to get a problem they were

500
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,480
lodging all the time um so we just

501
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,519
stopped actually putting nitrogen on

502
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,159
when we knew we were going into fields

503
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,519
that were you know had a good amount of

504
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,440
fertility on them we would see a

505
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:12,599
response from nitrogen when we were on

506
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,798
more depleted soils um but we would

507
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:16,558
barely see a

508
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:20,038
response

509
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:22,480
otherwise so we know that they require a

510
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:27,480
lot of nitrogen but they're also very

511
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:30,240
efficient um at taking taking it up and

512
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:33,200
digging deep into the soil profile for

513
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,720
it and again when we did studies this

514
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,759
was on

515
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:41,759
Sand you know we would see a response at

516
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:44,278
about a 90 lb rate right and the reason

517
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:47,240
we would see often lower yields at

518
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:51,119
higher races that we would see watching

519
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,839
not because you know it wasn't enhancing

520
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:58,359
you all right so as far as weed control

521
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:00,839
goes um you know the sunflowers were

522
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:03,158
responded well to time

523
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,720
weeding and

524
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,960
cultivation um time weeding worked

525
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,679
really well to control weeds it does

526
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,519
with anything as long as you hit the

527
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:18,240
timing right um but you know we if we

528
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,038
time we did a little too much sometimes

529
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,278
the we reduced the

530
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:24,679
populations especially a little bit

531
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:27,839
laters this is like 6 days after

532
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:29,919
planting and 12 Days After planting you

533
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:35,119
know we could reduce the population and

534
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:38,440
see some issues but again um we also

535
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,759
without any weed control could see uh

536
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,600
good

537
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:48,079
yields so it is more we competitive than

538
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:50,639
a prob like corn some of that has to do

539
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,439
with its ability to scavenge nutrients

540
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,799
it's growing in a different part of the

541
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,240
soil profile than many of the weeds I

542
00:26:54,798 --> 00:27:02,240
think so it is a a pretty resilient

543
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,120
Brant crop in that way all

544
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,839
right and here's the average rooting

545
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:11,439
depth of sunflowers it's quite

546
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:13,639
deep oops let

547
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,200
show um we did a lot of work with

548
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:20,320
interceding into sunflowers as well and

549
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,240
they actually um work better in

550
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:27,240
interceding systems way better than corn

551
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:29,919
because the canopy isn't quite as thick

552
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,120
um and it opens up a lot faster than

553
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,278
corn does so we had really good luck

554
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:38,479
interceding cover crops into sunflowers

555
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:41,960
a lot better than we did in the

556
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,558
cor all right the biggest disease issue

557
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:50,200
that we started to run into was white

558
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:52,759
mold uh sclerotinia and again rotation

559
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,679
is key for any of the diseases that

560
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:57,240
sunflower gets it also gets a lot of

561
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:59,200
dowy mildew so you want to select

562
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,960
resistant variet

563
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,038
white

564
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,240
mold um is an issue so if you're growing

565
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,599
other broad leaves that's something to

566
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,240
think about in your

567
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:13,639
rotation um I don't know if this happens

568
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,399
in other crops but the scary thing about

569
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,038
um white mold and

570
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:21,359
sunflowers is that it can actually

571
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:25,158
travel plant to plant through the

572
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:28,879
roots and you can just see whole

573
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:32,679
rows um going down from white mold from

574
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:36,760
one infection point on one

575
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:38,798
plane so this is one of the primary

576
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:40,278
reasons why you want to be really

577
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:44,759
careful if you're going to grow this

578
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:47,200
crop and how um close it is to other

579
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,599
white mold sensitive crops which is

580
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,480
basically any bro Leaf um and you know

581
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:56,199
if you start to see white mold be very

582
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:59,558
very cautious because it can spread this

583
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:04,919
way I I've never seen that in any other

584
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:07,038
crops so okay banded sunflower moth this

585
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:12,840
was our primary

586
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:16,640
Pest and um it got so bad in some

587
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:19,119
years that we couldn't figure out why we

588
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:23,480
weren't getting any

589
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,479
yields and we didn't see any bird

590
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,960
damage and we were combining I'm like

591
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,319
there so much seed here you could hear

592
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,200
coming out of the heads well it was all

593
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,639
blowing out of the back of the combine

594
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,720
because this nasty little larby had

595
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,360
eaten all the middle of the sea down and

596
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:45,679
so in years when it was really bad it

597
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:49,879
heavily impacted Yol and again the best

598
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:53,038
way that we found to manage this is by

599
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,039
delaying the pling

600
00:29:53,079 --> 00:30:00,599
date um

601
00:29:55,398 --> 00:30:03,959
Birds this is from uh picture up

602
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:03,959
north there they

603
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:11,079
are and obviously the more birds you

604
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,000
have the less Fields you have okay so

605
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:16,079
what do you

606
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,200
do plant some for the birds we did a lot

607
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:23,079
of work trying to find the right shaped

608
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:26,880
head for the job we read a lot about

609
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:30,558
some varieties their heads fold down

610
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,919
when they dry and some varieties cup up

611
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,558
um and some varieties are faced up and

612
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:38,519
some varieties drop so we thought well

613
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:43,398
we'll find a variety that's resistant to

614
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:46,359
bir we never do um so if it cffs up it

615
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:48,000
becomes a bird bath because it fills

616
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:49,678
with water and then they stand on the

617
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,480
edge and they take a drink and then they

618
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,360
put their body in their beak over the

619
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,919
edge and back the seeds out and then you

620
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:59,199
go to the sunflower and it's full of

621
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,840
bird seeds and water and poop

622
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,519
um and then you know if it was sped up

623
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:09,519
they just could just eat it so I don't

624
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:13,079
know selecting variety is really um was

625
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:15,519
really that useful but um because it

626
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:18,439
seemed like they were pretty much all

627
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,480
just suceptible but what we did find was

628
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,080
again delaying the planning date till

629
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,880
that first full week in June really

630
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:28,278
helped us avoid bird damage because you

631
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:32,840
know when the uh redwing black Birds

632
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:34,839
flock up right um you either don't want

633
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:36,678
the seat ready at that point or you want

634
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:39,240
it already out of the

635
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:42,080
field all

636
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,399
right there's some nitrogen issues

637
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,038
lodging and

638
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:49,398
deer you have a lot of deer they will

639
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,558
just bite the head right off before you

640
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:55,239
even see

641
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:58,319
it so just something to think about okay

642
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,278
harvesting um out in places where they

643
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:04,000
harvest sunflowers and these things

644
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:06,319
called sunflower pans or sunflower head

645
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,839
which we didn't have and if you try to

646
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,678
harvest them without this you'll lose

647
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:12,959
quite a bit of yield because the heads

648
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,720
come off and then they bounce they

649
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,880
bounce out when you're try you're

650
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,960
laughing you see

651
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,399
them they're going in nope they're

652
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,360
bouncing back out so the pans just kind

653
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:27,119
of catch um the heads as you're cutting

654
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:30,439
them off and then um brings them into

655
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,719
the combine so the farm that we worked

656
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,320
with on these projects they built their

657
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,120
own out of plywood and plastic and

658
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,960
whatever they had on the

659
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:42,678
farm so it works really well you can

660
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,840
build them on your own and then we built

661
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:49,278
some for the plot com to just bolted

662
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:52,480
them on and off and we weren't using

663
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:55,200
them okay so I think I

664
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,720
don't I'm just going to go down to the

665
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:04,038
um oil processing part because

666
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,038
is I don't know mat when am I

667
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:12,320
done 10 minutes ago a couple minutes

668
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:14,240
okay so I've done work in all the other

669
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,879
oil seeds too and I'm happy to talk

670
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,558
about that but I know people were

671
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:22,000
interested in oil

672
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:25,038
pressing and um all this stuff is on my

673
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,480
website and I did bring a few copies of

674
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:30,759
some of the booklets on small scale oil

675
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,240
proc in oil SE information about the

676
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:37,558
presses it's all still relevant

677
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:40,278
today um and I don't know if all these

678
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:42,558
models are still available or not but

679
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:46,880
they're listed there and those are all

680
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:52,158
the ones we Tri so on average we would

681
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:55,000
get 74 gallons of sunflower oil per

682
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,799
acre okay so if you're wondering like

683
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,759
what your yield of oil would be you can

684
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:02,759
land between you know 50 and 75

685
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:09,440
gallons these are the different presses

686
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:14,559
that we've used and operated they're all

687
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:16,639
available on a small scale um and the a

688
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:19,398
oil press

689
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,280
770 I think you can still get these

690
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:25,480
these were the only americanmade press

691
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,040
they were manufactured in Wisconsin and

692
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,398
it of all the presses it ended up being

693
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:32,480
the best

694
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:35,838
one largest soap of what you can

695
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,599
actually press with it

696
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,838
okay this is what all the these were all

697
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,240
screw

698
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:48,159
presses um and they all operate

699
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:51,719
basically in the same way so you put the

700
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:55,358
seed in um and it extrudes it through

701
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:57,719
that Barrel under pressure and speed and

702
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,799
the oil comes out and the meal comes

703
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:03,239
comes out the other

704
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:06,000
end so like I said we evaluated all of

705
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:08,598
these um obviously those costs started

706
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,400
from 14 years ago I'm sure they cost a

707
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:15,160
lot more now probably double I imagine

708
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:18,838
if not more um but all that information

709
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:22,199
is in the in the report in the capacity

710
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:22,199
what you can adjust on

711
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,320
them um and more information about how

712
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,680
much Capac

713
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:36,079
they could do most of them were meant to

714
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:40,279
do about a th000 to um 2,000 lbs a day

715
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:43,960
of seed um and you can see this is our

716
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,960
capacity that we

717
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,280
documented here's just um a couple of

718
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:52,279
pictures of the

719
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,280
presses and the meal coming out of

720
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,440
it we did a lot of work with the Chinese

721
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:02,079
presses they're cheap um um maybe not

722
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,838
anymore and uh you you had to mess

723
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,519
around with them a lot they weren't very

724
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:09,358
automated they were hard to adjust but

725
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:13,920
they were cheap I think at the time that

726
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:16,318
was $1,500 for that big mega mega press

727
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,880
none of the dials or buttons

728
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:22,079
worked they actually worked um so we had

729
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,440
to get it running but once we

730
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,400
did um and that's the a oil breast I

731
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,920
would recommend this one had the best

732
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,960
um service people that can work with you

733
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,119
call um this is the percent Oil we're

734
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:42,358
getting out so again we're getting

735
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:44,000
anywhere from basically 30 to 40% oil

736
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:48,078
out of the

737
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,639
seed um moisture content is really

738
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,039
important when you're pressing seed so

739
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,759
we know it's important when you're

740
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:58,079
storing seed but you actually want the

741
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:00,520
seed pretty dry not too dry and you

742
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,960
don't want it too wet to get the moist

743
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:09,199
uh the most oil out of it so usually we

744
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:12,000
were starting around 7% moisture 8%

745
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,598
moisture if you have too much moisture

746
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,838
which can be like

747
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,640
10% uh you just you'll see the the meal

748
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:22,639
will start coming through you won't be

749
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:25,480
getting any oil and if it's too dry you

750
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,679
know you'll hear the whole press going

751
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,679
trying to squeeze the seed through it

752
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:33,879
you also won't get any O So moisture

753
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:37,358
content um is really

754
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,680
important okay so last piece about

755
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:41,838
culinary

756
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:44,239
oil um we had a lot of people interested

757
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:49,279
in this especially at the end of our

758
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:52,199
project and So when you buy oil in a

759
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,599
store it has it all the same it's all

760
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:57,239
the same color more or less and it all

761
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:59,359
pretty much tastes the same uh except

762
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:03,479
for maybe olive oil and some of your

763
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:06,119
kind of finer highend uh oils and that's

764
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,880
because they're refined they're bleached

765
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,838
and they're deodorant so they look the

766
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,559
same they have no color and they taste

767
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:17,639
like nothing okay so you you actually

768
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,480
can do most of these on a small scale if

769
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,920
you wanted to we kind of figured out how

770
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:26,318
to do that but I doubt that's the market

771
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:30,318
people want to get into so really the

772
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:34,279
biggest thing that people need to do

773
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:36,239
after you press the oil is to filter it

774
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,680
and again you can do that just by

775
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,318
letting it

776
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:44,598
sit and all the gunk goes to the bottom

777
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:47,480
or you can buy um like simple stock

778
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:50,359
filters or you can do things that are

779
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,199
more complex like a filter press

780
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:56,159
something like you put CER through um

781
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:58,559
other food products so the filtering

782
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:01,440
just gets out the gunk and it can take

783
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:05,000
out some of the fossil liquids makes a

784
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,200
slightly cleaner product um and if you

785
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,719
are trying to um do any high oil high

786
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:14,199
heat cooking you definitely want to try

787
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:17,078
to have a a finer filtration process to

788
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:19,519
get out some of those fow lipids you're

789
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,599
just using it to make salad dressings

790
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:25,519
and maybe doing a little baking um you

791
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:28,240
can just let it settle and it'll be

792
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:32,599
great

793
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:36,039
um the shelf life of unrefined oils we

794
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:39,200
found to be much better than Commercial

795
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:42,000
Oil so this is accelerated shelf life

796
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:44,759
studies um that we did with Penn State

797
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,838
back in the day and because you're not

798
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,640
taking all the good stuff out of the oil

799
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:56,199
then it actually has a longer shelf life

800
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:59,480
because there's um more uh antioxidants

801
00:39:56,199 --> 00:40:01,279
and things like that like in the oil so

802
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,480
we found that the oil actually could

803
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,599
have last several years without changing

804
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,719
taste or really

805
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,800
colored okay um as f as far as sensoring

806
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,639
Consumer Testing we did a little bit of

807
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,720
this as well with Penn State made

808
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:20,480
Italian dressing out of it and put it in

809
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:22,799
front of people um and you know it was

810
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,280
different it wasn't really meant to be

811
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,359
the same um and you know it could be

812
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:32,960
very similar to Comm Commercial Oil but

813
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:36,639
um at the end of the day it still tastes

814
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,760
like the plain because you haven't

815
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:42,159
bleached it you haven't deodorized it so

816
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,839
if you're producing sunflower oil it's

817
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:47,318
going to taste like sunflow and if you

818
00:40:44,838 --> 00:40:50,440
bake with it we done going to taste

819
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:50,440
you're standing there and

820
00:40:53,318 --> 00:41:01,279
patient okay we did um tractors over to

821
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:03,318
run off from straight vegetable oil

822
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,000
which works really well this

823
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:09,519
summertime um as you can imagine um this

824
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,280
is a whole process in itself we had one

825
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:14,280
tractor that could run just off from the

826
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:18,160
vegetable oil we were

827
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:22,319
producing um but we also got into making

828
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:24,399
biodiesel on a many different scales um

829
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:27,000
that was our largest scale down in

830
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,200
southern Vermont um to the smallest

831
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,159
scale which was this little compact unit

832
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:35,439
that's what we used on the research farm

833
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:38,199
and we produced all the um diesel fuel

834
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,440
that we needed for the for the research

835
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:43,598
farm with that little unit um see had

836
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,039
little gas pump so it's pretty cool you

837
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:49,318
just like put the little ingredients

838
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,838
there on the side

839
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:56,519
then hit the buttons these buttons

840
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:59,239
worked and then you waited for 24 hours

841
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:59,239
and you get little

842
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:08,119
pump um and so there are a lot of ways

843
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:12,880
to that we TR to make uh diesel fuel but

844
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:14,800
we could actually make ASM braid fuel um

845
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,800
at our larger

846
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:23,680
facilities so it's 100% possible to grow

847
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:27,720
your own fuel make it on your farm

848
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:31,159
um we um that's a different kit

849
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:34,598
again this was 10 15 years ago but these

850
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:37,719
were the different Farms making Fuel and

851
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:41,119
it was costing people anywhere from 98

852
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:47,480
cents to $3

853
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:47,480
again you're you woke up

854
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:54,199
98 when I was five they sold gas

855
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:01,000
for um but I mean you know people were

856
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:04,639
really excited about this because it's

857
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,800
you know and so Mark and Bill they were

858
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:11,400
at um the largest

859
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:14,280
scale um they also were um kind of had

860
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,960
more efficiencies on their Farm the

861
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,400
research Farm that's Roger he was

862
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,559
producing fuel for about $3 that was

863
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:25,119
with that smaller system that I was

864
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:28,079
talking about so you know uh people were

865
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:31,240
doing it they were doing it very very

866
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,400
cheap um but I will say don't be doing

867
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:35,118
it

868
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,358
anymore all right so um one of the

869
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,960
benefits was to get the meal we were

870
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:41,759
talking about this pallet mail last

871
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,920
night we bought this out of China we had

872
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,160
a big China shopping spree one year so

873
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,880
most of it's in the Hedge R right now

874
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:55,879
but um we got everything that we could

875
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:59,240
get in a box on a ship for like

876
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:02,880
$25 um this I think this pellet cost

877
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:05,199
like 250 bucks or something but anyway

878
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,039
you can make briquettes we still have

879
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:10,039
you can make briquettes with it you can

880
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:12,400
make all different size pellets so

881
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:15,199
you're getting this Meal which is

882
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,240
another product of growing the oil

883
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:22,759
seed and we pelletized everything I was

884
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:27,519
found somebody this last night we

885
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:30,119
just um but the meal itself

886
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:32,759
is a a really valuable

887
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:36,000
resource um it's very high in

888
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,400
protein and we all know that soy meal

889
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,318
soybean meal canola meal these

890
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,000
byproducts are set fed in the livestock

891
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:45,719
industry so this was really exciting to

892
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,280
people in the project because most of

893
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:51,959
them were livestock um

894
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:56,000
Growers the downside was that our oil

895
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:59,079
seed meal still had a lot of oil in it

896
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,838
right when you commercially extract oil

897
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:05,240
out of seed they usually use hexane to

898
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:09,000
get out the last driplets

899
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:12,199
clearly we're not using H right so we

900
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,960
had a lot of oil left in that meal so it

901
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:19,039
gave the the meal really high fat

902
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:22,358
content which limited the amount of meal

903
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:25,719
that we could feed to a Rin because it

904
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:28,199
would you know upset the whole process

905
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:30,279
in there too much fat we did do a

906
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:33,838
feeding trial and kind of looked at all

907
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:36,480
of this um but what we ended up doing

908
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:39,279
was looking at this as a fertility

909
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,719
Source a really good organic fertility

910
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:46,839
Source you know between uh 4 and a half

911
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:49,679
and 6% nitrogen is pretty high for most

912
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:54,078
organic fertility sources so people were

913
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:57,078
putting it back on the land um and you

914
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:59,640
know using it primarily as a fertilizer

915
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:03,160
we did see in some of our studies when

916
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:06,679
we were using um canola mustard meal

917
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:06,679
that it actually suppressed

918
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:14,159
weeds I also killed all corn with

919
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,440
it too

920
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:20,960
much that was a lesson I learned

921
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,599
um some is good too much is too much I

922
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,679
kill the weeds and the corn nothing

923
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:30,119
gr um so it worked well so there's a lot

924
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:32,759
of nitrogen you know in those meals and

925
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:36,960
we could definitely fertilize the corn

926
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:41,079
crop um by putting the meal back on the

927
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,119
Wind we also uh burned it so we used it

928
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:46,160
as a fuel source because there's still a

929
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,440
lot of oil in it so we pelletized it and

930
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,558
put it in a pellet stove and he did the

931
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:55,039
shop with

932
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:59,000
it so it was an exciting time times are

933
00:46:55,039 --> 00:47:01,199
back um it's an ex time again lots of

934
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,679
uncertainty who the heck knows what's

935
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,879
going to happen tomorrow but you can

936
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,879
grow your own

937
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:14,159
fuel yeah you can do it you got the

938
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:16,558
power and I know the oil seed me I can

939
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,358
help you guys out you can do it together

940
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,400
U but that's what we're interested in is

941
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:24,159
sort of like who's in the loop you know

942
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:27,200
growing the oil seed the farmer um

943
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:30,639
pressing the oil selling the virgin oil

944
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:33,879
as a value added product um and then

945
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:38,000
getting the waste vegetable oil back to

946
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:40,519
be made into biodiesel back on the farm

947
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,599
um using the meal to feed animals or

948
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:47,880
feed the soil uh and then well

949
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:50,240
interestingly enough the administration

950
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,838
changed and the money that we were

951
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:57,118
getting to do this project and the focus

952
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:57,119
on the project just

953
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,040
yeah there we are again all right the

954
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:06,318
website it's all there

955
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:09,880
still um so you can access

956
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:12,199
it and there

957
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:18,000
we think we have time for one question

958
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:18,000
or so yeah well we need time to

959
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:23,239
so oh

960
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:27,760
[Music]

961
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:27,759
okay which what

962
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:33,799
oh we

963
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,318
have oh

964
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:41,000
you're we got rid of the Chinese

965
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:45,199
press the amount of lead paint on it was

966
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,199
really we actually did test

967
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,079
thater

968
00:48:51,159 --> 00:49:00,639
scared 201 dou after barley Ander

969
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:04,759
oil we had low oil cont is there any

970
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:04,759
relation between oil content

971
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,920
and yep

972
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:15,118
um so the oil content could be

973
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:18,680
influenced by like any number of

974
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:20,920
environmental factors we saw that um if

975
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:24,558
there was too much nitrogen the oil

976
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:26,720
content would be low we found you know

977
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,400
depending on the variety the oil cont

978
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:32,399
cont could be low I kind of wonder if in

979
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,400
that case because it was pretty

980
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,280
consistent for us with the exception of

981
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,280
the

982
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:47,039
cont

983
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:58,119
yeah how many hours did it take hours

984
00:49:51,838 --> 00:50:00,798
per gallon hours per gallon I don't know

985
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:04,039
but it's in the

986
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:06,199
booklet no it is there's a whole like

987
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:08,880
the little economic analysis I showed

988
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:11,838
you if you go to the website you can

989
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,559
still download all of all of that

990
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:17,519
information but also run your own

991
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:20,720
calculations yeah I don't know how many

992
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:22,000
hours for download a lot you know it's

993
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:24,838
interesting because when we first

994
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,039
started thinking about this we knew that

995
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:29,519
it would take Acres obviously make your

996
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:33,440
own Fuel and would that kind of pencil

997
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:35,280
out at the end of the day and we would

998
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,039
we always talked about oh well my

999
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,200
grandfather used to have

1000
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:42,000
horses and he had to set aside so much

1001
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:46,159
land to feed his

1002
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,318
horses um so that he had power to run

1003
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,838
his farm and so we we all started

1004
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:54,279
talking about that like how many acres

1005
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:57,838
would it take to actually fuel our Farms

1006
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:01,480
um but so there's a lot to consider

1007
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:01,480
obviously in that process

1008
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,599
yeah

1009
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:13,079
ethanol no

1010
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:15,040
possible they say it's possible we we

1011
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:17,839
never did and that was a problem that we

1012
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:20,519
were starting to have to deal with was

1013
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:21,318
the wi that was being produced right you

1014
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:24,280
have

1015
00:51:21,318 --> 00:51:26,239
glycerin um and some other waste and

1016
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,720
then like what we were we going to do

1017
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:31,639
with that you can actually process it

1018
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:35,358
and clean it to get the methanol out of

1019
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:38,519
it so I'm only telling you part of the

1020
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,519
story you guys know

1021
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:46,039
that's this has been a production of

1022
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:49,039
Cornell University on the web at

1023
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:49,039
