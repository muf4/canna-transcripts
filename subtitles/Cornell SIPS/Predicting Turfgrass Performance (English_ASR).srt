1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,480
university

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,879
good afternoon everyone i am absolutely

4
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,519
thrilled to be here and it is so

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,118
exciting to have a chance to talk about

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,118
some of the work that i've been doing

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:25,198
recently since i left cornell in 2006.

8
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,800
and this is my first time back to campus

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,640
since then and

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,960
so many great memories come back and

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,120
it's it's really just a thrill and an

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,120
honor to be here so thank you very much

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,399
for for inviting me and and having me

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,159
here

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,200
this is the asian turf grass research

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,359
facility 70 kilometers north of bangkok

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,000
this photo you'll notice

18
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,640
was taken in 2008 this doesn't exist

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,600
anymore i built this and maintained it

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,359
and had seven employees but we found

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,520
although we learned a lot about turf

22
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,840
grass it really wasn't a very good

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,079
business because this cost a lot of

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,039
money to operate

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,719
but

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,359
it didn't really generate a lot of

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,200
revenue but in the four years that we

28
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:11,438
had the asian turfgrass center research

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,359
facility from 2006 until 2009 i got a

30
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,158
chance to work with so many different

31
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,159
kinds of grass and i got a chance to see

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,880
how they performed

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,520
and now i travel around a lot and i see

34
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,798
grasses in so many different places

35
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,840
and there's

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,000
there's a big area in asia and there's

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,320
all different kinds of grasses growing

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,680
in the different places so this is in

39
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,639
singapore there's a grass called

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,439
broadleaf carpet grass we can go to

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,239
india this is in southern india at kodai

42
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,478
canal this is kaikuyu grass this is a

43
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,280
gar it's the world's

44
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,118
largest species of wild cattle and these

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,840
are a very strong animal it looks like

46
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:54,000
they'd lumber but they actually can jump

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,719
very high they're they're extremely

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,959
strong just pure muscle

49
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,438
in fact tigers don't attack them i've

50
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,919
heard that that they will take out a

51
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,758
tiger if a tiger would attack it

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,439
this is kikuyu grass which is a grass

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,318
that's from i believe the highlands of

54
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,719
of east africa originally

55
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,039
this is in the same state in in

56
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,840
coimbatore in tamil nadu now we have

57
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,719
seashore paspalum and you'll see a

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,239
little bit of bermuda grass is growing

59
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,479
there

60
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,719
coming in a bit of this we're seeing is

61
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,799
a video distortion but there's some

62
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,280
bermuda grass there's a weed invading

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,879
seashore pastebalum turf

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,439
there's also some footprints going

65
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:38,079
across the grass can anybody guess what

66
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,079
that might be

67
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,039
elephant footprints

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,560
so you can see the you can see the muddy

69
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,719
areas this course is still under

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,360
construction there's some open land and

71
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,280
the elephants came out and one of those

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,239
is an adult elephant and then there was

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,120
a baby elephant coming along with it so

74
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,120
one of

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,158
the thrilling things about my job in

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,319
addition to me being so interested in

77
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,158
grass and getting to see different

78
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,039
grasses growing in so many different

79
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:11,280
places i also get to see cool things

80
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:15,359
like elephants going across the turf

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,360
that one wouldn't otherwise see

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,400
so we go from the areas near the equator

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,080
where there's all warm season grasses

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,439
grow grasses that use the c4

85
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,440
photosynthetic pathway up to korea or

86
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,840
northern japan this is in hokkaido in

87
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,400
the northern part of japan now it's all

88
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,878
cool season grasses something similar

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,519
to what would be growing here the rye

90
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,039
grasses and the fescue grasses and the

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,200
bluegrasses

92
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,919
we can also see a bit of that in the

93
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,560
high elevation areas in japan this is in

94
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,598
a golf course in yamanashi prefecture

95
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,759
which is

96
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,000
that's mount fuji in the background on a

97
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,798
late summer day so there's only a little

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,199
bit of snow around the summit

99
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,200
and in japan it gets into the transition

100
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,039
zone and then much of asia is what we

101
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,079
would call transition zone where it can

102
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:07,280
be both warm and cool season grasses

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,000
but an an interesting thing about asia

104
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,199
is there's not a lot of turf grass

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,598
research

106
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:17,918
so it's this vast area of

107
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,358
a vast area of the world without turf

108
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,240
grass research

109
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,799
stations without people doing a lot of

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,439
research about grass and as i travel

111
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,520
around i'm able to learn a lot

112
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,079
about what is actually growing but i'm

113
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,719
not able to put out test plots or try

114
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:38,639
new varieties or new species of grass

115
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,360
because it just would not be feasible

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,120
i made this map and i marked in cornell

117
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,080
red

118
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,040
the various places that i've traveled to

119
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:53,039
but many of these places so

120
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,879
this is guam this is melbourne adelaide

121
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,759
this is mauritius

122
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,600
so

123
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,680
we go a little bit outside of asia

124
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,960
because mauritius is africa this is

125
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,038
australia

126
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,599
dubai in the west

127
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:08,639
and then various places through south

128
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,400
asia southeast asia and east asia

129
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,120
i've been to a lot of

130
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,159
a lot of places to study about grass

131
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,240
and these aren't just one-time visits so

132
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,880
for example a place like tokyo is just

133
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,038
marked on there once but i've been there

134
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,399
obviously a lot of times

135
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:29,199
and just to give you an idea of the

136
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,638
scale of this some of you will have been

137
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,038
to asia probably are from there but

138
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,400
last week i flew from reykjavik in

139
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,639
iceland to new york city and that flight

140
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,399
is actually shorter than the bangkok to

141
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,280
tokyo flight and i take the bangkok to

142
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,120
tokyo flight many times a year and

143
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,918
that's longer

144
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,439
than the flight from new york city to

145
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:57,439
reykjavik so that would just be from

146
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,160
from bangkok here up to tokyo

147
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,160
so

148
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,199
we get a huge variety in the grasses and

149
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,520
the question is how can we predict

150
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,600
what grass we would use because the

151
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,439
question everybody asked me what what

152
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,639
the the first question is what grass

153
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,240
should i grow and we can look at so

154
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,000
many of the turf grasses that were

155
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,000
planted in the 1990s early 2000s they

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,560
didn't work very good and i'm going to

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,918
explain a little bit later why i think

158
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,680
that is

159
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,079
but the first question what grass should

160
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,840
i grow how can we possibly predict that

161
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,918
if we aren't testing grasses in

162
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,239
different areas that's that's a big

163
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,399
question and the second main question

164
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,759
which i will touch on how i try to

165
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,159
address that

166
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,479
is how should we manage the grass so

167
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,840
once we choose the grass

168
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,240
how can we manage it so i'm going to

169
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,560
talk a little bit today about how we

170
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,800
might manage some of the

171
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,879
nutrient additions to the grass looking

172
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,680
at what the nutrient requirements of the

173
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,918
grass are

174
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,800
i made this little chart and i just

175
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:05,198
plotted on the y-axis is the average

176
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,400
annual temperature which ranges here

177
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,560
from 15 to about 28 degrees and then i

178
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,799
just listed these cities so if the

179
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,120
city's down at the bottom that means it

180
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,759
has a cooler average annual temperature

181
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,759
if the city's listed at the top it means

182
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,879
it has a higher average annual

183
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,360
temperature

184
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,959
and one of the ways that we would decide

185
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,199
what grass to use in in a in a broad way

186
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,799
would be to look at what the temperature

187
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,280
is

188
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,000
and you'll notice if you'd go to all of

189
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,638
these places and look at the grasses

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,720
once you get above an average annual

191
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,639
temperature of 20 degrees

192
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,720
you don't really see

193
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,240
the cool season grasses growing in those

194
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,440
areas at all

195
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,160
so we can basically say that the 20

196
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,918
degree average annual temperature is a

197
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,199
pretty good

198
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:59,598
cutting off point for where the the

199
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,520
transition zone ends and we don't

200
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,199
attempt to grow cool season grasses

201
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,120
anymore

202
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,120
so the cool season grasses are those

203
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,680
that use the c3s photosynthetic pathway

204
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,280
and in dallas there's it's mostly warm

205
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,598
season grass but there's a bit of cool

206
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,679
season in fukuoka

207
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,360
there's mostly warm season but a bit of

208
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,038
cool season

209
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,000
you know greenville south carolina

210
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,839
shanghai atlanta there's

211
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,439
people in atlanta will have tall fescue

212
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,918
lawns that's a that's a cool season

213
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,598
grass and yet they also have a lot of

214
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:35,120
warm season grass

215
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:38,958
so one way to look at it is just by the

216
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,599
the temperature but to look at it more

217
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,838
specifically it's interesting to look at

218
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,680
something called the growth potential

219
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,680
and i've there's a couple handouts left

220
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,000
if you're interested in this and want to

221
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,919
see it right now i will also post this

222
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,679
on my website tonight

223
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,759
so you can

224
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,278
you can download all these slides and

225
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,838
you'll also be able to download the

226
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:04,879
handout which has these equations and

227
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,640
links to additional information on it

228
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,919
that's

229
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,759
asianturfgrass.com and you can find on

230
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,159
the blog section of it

231
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,080
i'll make a new update so the growth

232
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:17,519
potential

233
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,800
generates a number between zero and one

234
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,600
that essentially tells us how close the

235
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,599
actual temperature is to the optimum

236
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,759
temperature for photosynthesis and

237
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,560
there's some general research that says

238
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,080
for cool season grasses they grow the

239
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,679
best and they have the optimum

240
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,080
photosynthesis when the average

241
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,479
temperature is 20. so this equation

242
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,440
looks a little bit tricky but there's

243
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,680
actually only one variable because

244
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,320
the gp is growth potential which is what

245
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,120
we're going to calculate this is a

246
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,080
constant this is a constant the optimum

247
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,080
temperature is a constant we just change

248
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,639
it based on what we decide our optimum

249
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,959
temperature is the variance just adjusts

250
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,838
the shape of the curve so that's also a

251
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:04,479
constant the only variable we have here

252
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,800
is the actual temperature so we can put

253
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,440
that in on a daily basis or a weekly

254
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,359
basis or a monthly basis

255
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,600
and we can calculate what the growth

256
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,320
potential is of the turf which tells us

257
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,720
how we expect the grass to grow in

258
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,120
response to temperature so assuming that

259
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,800
water is not limiting assuming that

260
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,200
light is not limiting assuming

261
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,359
that the amount of nitrogen that the

262
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,120
plant has in the leaf is not limiting

263
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,639
then the temperature will be controlling

264
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,959
the growth

265
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,838
we get this type of curve then so we've

266
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:44,239
got temperature on the x-axis going from

267
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,480
0 degrees celsius up to 31 and if we

268
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,720
look at the warm season curve we see it

269
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,120
starts slowly once we get to about 12

270
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,879
degrees or 15 degrees which is where

271
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,519
warm season grasses will come out of

272
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:58,320
dormancy and start growing then we see a

273
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,399
gradual increase until we get up to

274
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
about 25 degrees

275
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,159
now we get a growth potential that's

276
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,799
greater than 0.75

277
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:09,519
meaning the grass could grow at 75

278
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:13,278
percent or more of its of its potential

279
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,000
with a optimum of 31 which is what the

280
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,519
textbooks say is the optimum

281
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,360
growth temperature for warm season

282
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,440
grasses

283
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,200
now i don't let warm season grasses go

284
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,200
down after this i've talked to lots of

285
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,519
people in dubai where sometimes the

286
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,519
temperatures are well into the 40s and

287
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,480
they assure me that as long as the

288
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,639
grasses are supplied with enough water

289
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,360
they don't see a restriction in growth

290
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,360
and if i read about

291
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,360
the photosynthesis of warm season

292
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,800
grasses there's been some experiments

293
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,800
with bermuda grass where they

294
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:48,000
accidentally let the greenhouse get too

295
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:50,240
hot and the temperature was up to 40 or

296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,519
above and there they actually the grass

297
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,360
was growing better so i think with warm

298
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,360
season grasses

299
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,039
basically anywhere in the world we don't

300
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,159
get an average temperature that's above

301
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,159
about 33 or 34. so any

302
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,838
any temperature that we're looking at

303
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,759
the we can expect the warm season

304
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,000
grasses are going to grow better with

305
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:13,200
increasing temperatures for cool season

306
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,159
grasses it's a bit different because now

307
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,240
we get a peak around 20 degrees and as

308
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,639
it gets above 20 degrees we'll see a

309
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,440
restriction in growth and i looked up

310
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,480
the the 30 year average weather data for

311
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,160
syracuse

312
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,399
and i calculated the monthly growth

313
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,319
potential based on that

314
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,039
so now we're looking on the x-axis

315
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,200
january through december

316
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,639
and i've plotted the monthly growth

317
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,040
potential based on the average

318
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,320
temperature on the y-axis

319
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,439
and

320
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,480
i think frank could probably tell me

321
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,040
if

322
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,159
if this is relatively accurate or not

323
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:53,278
this is predicting that the grass starts

324
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,838
to grow just a little bit in april it

325
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,000
grows relatively well by may

326
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,000
it has the potential to grow well this

327
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,919
is assuming it's supplied with water and

328
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,399
nothing else is limiting

329
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:09,519
no other limiting factors and it looks

330
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,919
by october it's it's really slowing down

331
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,639
in november it stopped

332
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,439
it so that's what it shows for syracuse

333
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,919
i i think based on my time here this

334
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,440
seems about right to me and this is very

335
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,838
interesting you'll notice we're getting

336
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,839
a number from zero to one

337
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,160
so we could actually look at that as a

338
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,760
fraction we could multiply that times

339
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,078
something such as

340
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,360
the nitrogen fertilizer rate so we could

341
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,879
say

342
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,039
and i'll talk about this at the end of

343
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,679
the presentation we choose a maximum

344
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:42,240
nitrogen rate that we want to apply

345
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,799
and because the the amount of nitrogen

346
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,919
in the leaf tends to be relatively

347
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,000
constant

348
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,319
then the growth rate of the grass is

349
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,078
going to be using nitrogen at a rate

350
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,720
that's proportional to the growth rate

351
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,479
so we can supply that nitrogen and we

352
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,800
can make sure that the grass is not

353
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,720
limited in nitrogen at the times when

354
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:04,719
the temperatures are at an optimum for

355
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,519
photosynthesis so this will lead to

356
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,040
theoretically an optimal

357
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,519
photosynthesis

358
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,679
for the grass let's add in a

359
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,399
city where it's hotter let's add in

360
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,799
shanghai onto this chart and you'll see

361
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,159
it looks quite different so now instead

362
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,799
of just looking at the overall

363
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,639
temperature we we're looking at it in a

364
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,439
little bit more detail by calculating

365
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:31,120
the growth potential on a monthly basis

366
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,760
and shanghai now is this color

367
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,720
the winters are a little bit warmer

368
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,120
in shanghai but it's still cold enough

369
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,040
that the grass really won't grow but

370
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,480
it's a month ahead in the spring you see

371
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:46,879
the march growth potential in shanghai

372
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,440
is pretty similar to the april growth

373
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:54,159
potential in syracuse and the

374
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,480
april growth potential in syracuse is

375
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,039
very similar to the may growth potentia

376
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,480
i'm sorry the april growth potential in

377
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:05,198
shanghai is very simple similar to the

378
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,240
may growth potential in syracuse but

379
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:11,679
then after peaking in

380
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:15,120
may in shanghai it comes down again in

381
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,439
june july august and september because

382
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,720
it's too hot in those months so there's

383
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,000
a lot of photo respiration going on and

384
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,639
the the

385
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,720
nat photosynthesis is not nearly as good

386
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,240
so the problem with cool season grasses

387
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,399
in in

388
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,120
high temperatures is is

389
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,240
largely a problem of photorespiration so

390
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,039
the

391
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,759
photosynthetic

392
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,480
system is not working so efficiently

393
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,039
so

394
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,800
and then in the autumn shanghai

395
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,679
it can grow well again and then it

396
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,838
plummets in the winter so i find it very

397
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,159
interesting to look at the growth

398
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,240
potential to look at

399
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:58,319
the detailed way that different grasses

400
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,000
may grow in in different locations

401
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,720
but there's something else going on

402
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,039
besides the temperature this is bermuda

403
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,720
grass turf mode at 12 millimeters and it

404
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,599
doesn't look right you see this picture

405
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,680
is pretty dark and there's actually not

406
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,639
grass completely covering the surface

407
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:17,278
here 12 millimeters is a pretty nice

408
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,079
mowing height that's a half inch we

409
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:24,639
would expect if this grass was growing

410
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:26,799
in miami florida or atlanta georgia this

411
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,680
photo was taken in september i was just

412
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,479
here a few weeks ago and there's algae

413
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:35,039
growing in between the leaves

414
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,199
if if this grass was managed in the same

415
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,919
way in atlanta or in miami or in

416
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:44,240
jacksonville we would have a dense

417
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,240
turf that completely covers the surface

418
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,360
but what we see in asia is bermuda grass

419
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,278
has a rather rather open canopy it gets

420
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,519
invaded by weeds this is

421
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,720
at rhoda island which is just north of

422
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,120
guam in the northern marianas this golf

423
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,680
course this is a golf course fairway it

424
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,240
was planted to bermuda grass but now

425
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,480
it's completely weeds there's very

426
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,679
little bermuda grass left

427
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,199
and

428
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,679
that's what happens when you don't apply

429
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,279
herbicides to bermuda grass in that

430
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,280
climate

431
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,439
it the grass just gets overtaken by

432
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,240
weeds this was a couple weeks ago in

433
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,919
bangkok this is a bermuda grass golf

434
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,640
course putting green

435
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,160
and around the outside is manila grass

436
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,679
soyamatrela

437
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,640
and over

438
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,640
about i think this green was planted

439
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,360
about 10 years ago

440
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,360
the

441
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:42,240
zoysia has encroached almost 2 meters

442
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,839
in in 10 years but what we tend to see

443
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,400
in the united states they apply

444
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,959
herbicides onto zoysia grass to keep the

445
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,120
bermuda grass from encroaching i visited

446
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,440
a golf course in memphis

447
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,759
in april and they had had to do a

448
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,480
tremendous amount of re-sodding and they

449
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,480
had to use herbicides to control the

450
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,798
bermuda grass that's encroaching into

451
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,839
the zoysia but in asia we see something

452
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:10,960
completely different we see zoysia

453
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,839
overtaking bermuda and we see bermuda

454
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,120
not growing very

455
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,959
well so

456
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,479
the the

457
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,240
factors affecting growth are not only

458
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,519
it's not only the temperature we need to

459
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,798
consider the temperature but there's

460
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,639
more to it and i want to show now

461
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:32,160
something that i think is very

462
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,320
interesting it's quite a difference

463
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,038
between

464
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,960
asia and north america in general so

465
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,960
i've put a link to this website this is

466
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,960
climate.asianturfgrass.com

467
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,080
and

468
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,880
i've got some interactive

469
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,879
charts here

470
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:59,200
that that have normal climatological

471
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,880
normals weather data embedded so i want

472
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,880
to choose here let's look at a couple

473
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,160
cities we might be familiar with let's

474
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,760
look at

475
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,480
hilo hawaii which is on the big island

476
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,558
let's look at honolulu hawaii

477
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,640
and let's look at

478
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,200
miami in

479
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,640
florida and i'm going to plot time on

480
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,480
the x-axis

481
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,679
and i'm going to plot the average

482
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,519
temperature

483
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,080
throughout the year on the y-axis and

484
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,639
i'll click here on trails

485
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,918
so that it will show the mark

486
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,919
and we'll just click play

487
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,240
see miami is a bit cooler in the winter

488
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,280
miami's the the kind of greenish one

489
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,240
here

490
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,240
i'll speed this up

491
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,119
you can see the temperatures are

492
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,240
relatively similar it goes down to about

493
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,678
20

494
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,240
comes up just a bit over 25 during the

495
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,919
summer and then miami comes down to be a

496
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,359
little bit cooler

497
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,759
in the

498
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,240
in the winter so the the temperatures

499
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,079
are quite similar but there's a big

500
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,400
difference how many people have been to

501
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:10,158
hilo

502
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,159
how many people have been to honolulu

503
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,200
if you go and look at the grasses

504
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,079
you will find if you walk out of the

505
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,720
hilo airport there's palm trees with

506
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:24,879
manila grass growing around them and if

507
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,839
you go to honolulu you will see a lot of

508
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,120
bermuda grass growing so those grasses

509
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:30,720
even though it's very close

510
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,879
geographically

511
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,839
it's different species of grasses

512
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,600
tending to grow in a in a wild or

513
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,359
relatively low maintenance type of

514
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,319
environment i'm just going to change the

515
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:45,839
y-axis now to sunshine hours and you'll

516
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:48,000
see hilo separates now so miami and

517
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:52,639
honolulu

518
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,279
on average have about 200 to 300 hours

519
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,480
of bright sunshine per month this is not

520
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,879
day length this is bright sunshine hours

521
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,200
which is measured when the light

522
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,840
intensity is greater than 120 watts per

523
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,600
square meter or something i'm not quite

524
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:14,240
sure on that that unit helo however has

525
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,959
on average maybe 150

526
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,000
hours per month of bright sunshine

527
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,319
and

528
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,240
so that means it's considerably more

529
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,759
cloudy

530
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,000
and that means there's less light

531
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,720
available for photosynthesis and if we

532
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,119
model photosynthesis an easy a simple

533
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,079
way to model photosynthesis

534
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:37,119
is say that it's equal to

535
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:39,599
the the light times the temperature

536
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:42,319
times the amount of nitrogen in the leaf

537
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:45,678
times the water availability so you put

538
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,960
an index of zero to one for every one of

539
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,840
those

540
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,600
main factors and then just multiply them

541
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,918
and so

542
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,000
if if the light was zero for instance it

543
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,480
would cancel out having an optimum

544
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,038
amount of water optimum amount of

545
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,960
nitrogen and optimum temperature if if

546
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,200
it's completely dark and you have no

547
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,440
energy you won't have photosynthesis

548
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,919
likewise if there's no water you won't

549
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,200
have photosynthesis despite the fact

550
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,080
that you could have

551
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,679
an optimum temperature optimum nitrogen

552
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,519
and optimum

553
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,320
light availability

554
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,359
so

555
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:24,399
in in managed turf grass systems

556
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:27,199
we can usually control the water a bit

557
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,000
because we have drainage systems and

558
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,880
because we have irrigation systems so i

559
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,960
just drop i drop water out of the

560
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,520
equation because that's something that

561
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,880
we theoretically can control we can

562
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:43,839
control it and because we apply nitrogen

563
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,080
fertilizer we can very precisely control

564
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,720
how much nitrogen is in the leaf so that

565
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,720
means i also drop that out when i'm

566
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,159
looking at at how

567
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,880
these factors may influence

568
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,840
photosynthesis so what we're left with

569
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,480
is temperature and sunshine hours so i

570
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,959
think it's awesome instead of plotting

571
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,440
time versus sunshine hours or time

572
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,440
versus

573
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,119
the

574
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,120
optimum temperature i like to plot

575
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,599
sunshine hours and temperature against

576
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:17,439
each other and now we'll get a circle

577
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:18,879
that describes the area on this chart

578
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,798
the the

579
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,679
that's circumscribed in one year so i'll

580
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,918
show you how this looks so let's just

581
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,120
we'll simplify this we'll just look at

582
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,520
honolulu and hilo

583
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,678
so now on the x-axis we're looking at

584
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,918
the temperature throughout the year on

585
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,200
the y-axis we're looking at sunshine

586
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,679
hours

587
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,480
and we

588
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,038
we're it draws a circle around it so

589
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,079
this combination of temperature and

590
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,679
sunshine hours on this scatter plot is

591
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,879
what the growing environment is at

592
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,840
honolulu the growing environment at hilo

593
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,360
has no overlap with honolulu there's not

594
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:02,399
a single day in the year when on average

595
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:05,519
the combination of temperature

596
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,440
and sunshine hours is the same because

597
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,079
there's no overlap there's not a single

598
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,080
day in the year

599
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,919
and

600
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:16,079
i i think this is interesting to apply

601
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,559
also to places where i've never been

602
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,639
like rio de janeiro because they were

603
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,720
going to choose what grass was going to

604
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,120
be planted on the golf course in the

605
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,120
olympics which in the turf grass

606
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,119
field that was kind of an interesting

607
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,678
thing and

608
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:34,319
i looked up the data

609
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,360
and i thought it's interesting that rio

610
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,319
rather than being similar

611
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,519
i'll show

612
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:44,639
i'll show you miami

613
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,639
we'll get rid of hilo

614
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,558
let's draw miami here

615
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:52,400
so to make this fast i'll just drag it

616
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,239
across

617
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,720
so here's here's the circle that miami

618
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,159
circumscribed so it goes down to about

619
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,798
19 degrees at the coldest it goes up to

620
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,200
about 28 degrees at the warmest and on

621
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:10,639
average there's always between 200 to

622
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,880
310 sunshine hours per month that's the

623
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,720
growing environment in miami and a lot

624
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,960
of

625
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,360
a lot of turf grass or certainly golf

626
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,440
people in the united states they think

627
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,399
they seem to think that warm

628
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,640
season grasses are kind of like if it

629
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,200
works in florida it's going to work

630
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,679
someplace else

631
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,840
however i would say if you

632
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,519
just because the temperature is the same

633
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,359
that's interesting but if you don't have

634
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,839
the light the photosynthesis is going to

635
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,678
be completely different if we draw rio

636
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,759
on here now

637
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,159
you'll see there's also zero overlap

638
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,000
with miami

639
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,200
so now

640
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
rio's in orange

641
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,278
miami is in

642
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,200
green

643
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,640
and you can see there's not a single day

644
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,440
in the year

645
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,400
in

646
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,600
in which on average the temperature

647
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:10,159
combination and the sunshine combination

648
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:11,278
is the same at rio and at miami

649
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,720
and

650
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,480
even though the temperatures are almost

651
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,480
the same it actually gets colder on

652
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,038
average in miami and it gets a little

653
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,839
bit hotter on average in miami than it

654
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:24,319
does in rio but the sunshine hours are

655
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,359
considerably less in real so that would

656
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,759
tell me

657
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,959
maybe the grasses that work in miami

658
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:34,400
would not necessarily work at rio and

659
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:39,079
what's interesting is is the grasses are

660
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,080
similar to the grasses at hilo

661
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,720
so

662
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,840
we'll see a huge amount of overlap here

663
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,440
now helo's in yellow rio's in orange

664
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,879
so we draw these

665
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,600
it's real they completely overlap

666
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,360
hong kong will overlap also

667
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,359
hong kong i think is in blue now

668
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,759
these charts they're interactive and

669
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,919
they're hours of

670
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,359
fun it's like video games

671
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,440
video games for turf turfgrass

672
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,798
scientists so you can see

673
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,558
hong kong

674
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:14,639
completely encircles both hilo and

675
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,720
rio and

676
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,799
i guess it's a good thing that i've

677
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,960
traveled to so many of these places some

678
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,960
of these places i've not been to

679
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,079
but i've traveled to enough of them to

680
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,840
have

681
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,000
and study the grasses and i'm pretty

682
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,959
confident that if you have a certain

683
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,079
type of

684
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,000
species combination growing in one place

685
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,079
probably an area with such a similar

686
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,720
climate is going to

687
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:41,119
going to see

688
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,558
similar grasses performing well

689
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,239
so when you say you're looking at the

690
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:45,918
grasses you need to

691
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,519
tell everyone that picture of you with

692
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,440
the flip-flops in the cornell shirt is

693
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,440
where you go look you're just not

694
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,159
looking out horses

695
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,000
yes i like to look in the wild and i

696
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,360
like to look on low maintenance

697
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,679
maintained turf areas such as cemeteries

698
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,558
parks

699
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,519
and and in the wild and hiking climbing

700
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,599
mountains

701
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,079
and and just see what's growing there's

702
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,719
an excellent example in thailand at a

703
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,558
place that's called maraca

704
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,159
tayawan palace

705
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:19,359
for short we just call it the love

706
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,039
palace it's uh about two and a half

707
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,599
hours drive from bangkok and it's the

708
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,079
most spectacular piece of tropical

709
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,359
architecture you'll ever see and it was

710
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,558
built by

711
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:34,158
the king rama the v i believe

712
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:36,079
in the early 1900's for his pregnant

713
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,000
wife and

714
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,119
it's now a museum and it has these

715
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,599
beautifully landscaped lawns

716
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,918
that under the tree right under the drip

717
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,678
line it's xonopus compresses broadleaf

718
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,640
carpet grass which is an extremely shade

719
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,000
tolerant grass in full sun it's zoysia

720
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,159
matrella

721
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,640
and it's mowed turf and you just don't

722
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,039
find bermuda grass there and in the

723
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,679
united states we think of zoysia matrala

724
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:04,079
manila grass as being a grass that's

725
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,440
really suitable for shaded environments

726
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:10,319
but in bangkok because the because of

727
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,440
the cloud cover that restricts the light

728
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,319
that

729
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,519
the full sun area is equivalent in the

730
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,839
amount of

731
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,079
photosynthetically active radiation

732
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,839
perhaps to a shaded area

733
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,879
to what we'd consider a shaded area in

734
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:27,199
the united states and i think this is

735
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,640
extremely fascinating i've made lots of

736
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,679
measurements about this and written

737
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,240
about it and in the handout i put links

738
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,480
to articles i wrote on this that can be

739
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,558
downloaded and

740
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,880
you can go to other sections of this web

741
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,440
page

742
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,600
for example

743
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,159
here where i actually estimate the daily

744
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,398
light integral

745
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,399
and this is better for viewing on the

746
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:55,119
computer instead of in the presentation

747
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,558
room that you can see

748
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,599
you can see this if you go to the

749
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,398
website

750
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:02,398
and you can read more about

751
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,398
what i do with this

752
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,398
so

753
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,879
um i

754
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,000
i would like to

755
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,278
say

756
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
quickly

757
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,000
let me check my notes

758
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:28,879
ah right i wrote a little bit about this

759
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:32,079
in the handout we how many people have

760
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,440
heard of daily light integral dli

761
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:37,119
i think that's used a lot in greenhouses

762
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,519
isn't it

763
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,959
for so daily light integral is you take

764
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,759
every second you measure the

765
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,960
photosynthetic photon flux density the

766
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:49,519
ppfd or the par the photosynthetically

767
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,640
actively radiation photosynthetically

768
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:55,440
active radiation measure it every second

769
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,759
and over a 24-hour period add all of

770
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,519
that together and we get a daily light

771
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:03,359
integral which is the number of photons

772
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,240
per square meter

773
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,959
per day expressed in units of moles per

774
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,558
square meter per day

775
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,640
and

776
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:15,599
that's something that is difficult to

777
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,880
measure all over the world but it's

778
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:21,199
pretty cool we can estimate that

779
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,880
pretty accurately from the sunshine

780
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,278
hours data there's something called the

781
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,000
angstrom equation that allows us

782
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:32,119
to relate the

783
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,038
the sunshine hours data to the actual

784
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:38,319
intensity of the light that reaches the

785
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:40,398
earth's surface in in terms of energy

786
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,759
and then based on that there's another

787
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,599
uh

788
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,759
it's a pretty simple conversion factor

789
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,879
to estimate the photosynthetic what

790
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,720
percentage of the total energy

791
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,679
that reaches the surface

792
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,120
is uh is photosynthetically active and

793
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,440
so we can actually estimate not we we

794
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:01,278
can take those sunshine hours data and

795
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,600
not just look at the sunshine hours data

796
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:05,440
if we want to we can estimate the the

797
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,359
dli

798
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,600
which unfortunately in turf grass we

799
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:12,319
don't really have good numbers for what

800
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:15,359
the actual requirements are but

801
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:17,759
i have some ideas based on what the

802
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,879
estimated dli's are in different

803
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,879
locations and then based on what

804
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,320
grass species we actually see growing

805
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,840
there so that's empirical research not

806
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,839
really controlled research in that

807
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:37,519
i

808
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,080
took a trip to

809
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,120
hilo to check this out and it's i was

810
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,798
fortunate as i was leaving honolulu the

811
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:45,918
top left photo is the view from the

812
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,359
airplane

813
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,840
that's it

814
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,319
4 28 in the afternoon

815
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:54,319
exactly 30 minutes later

816
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,798
i'd gone from sunshine to where i was

817
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:59,038
arriving in hilo it was now very low

818
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,599
clouds those type of clouds would be

819
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:04,480
blocking about 75 percent of the faux

820
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:07,199
set photosynthetically active light

821
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,360
the next day going back as we were going

822
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,000
down the runway in hilo

823
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,398
taxiing it was raining hard there were

824
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
low lights that's there were low clouds

825
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:16,879
that's also going to be blocking a lot

826
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
of the

827
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,000
photosynthetically active radiation

828
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,159
arriving back to honolulu it's almost

829
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,159
completely clear skies beautiful

830
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,880
beautiful sunset

831
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,399
and on average you can see the average

832
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,960
annual sunshine hours in honolulu are

833
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:38,158
considerably more that's a lot of that's

834
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,159
a lot of energy and remember for cool

835
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,679
season grasses this isn't so important

836
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,799
because they can't use all of the

837
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,798
available energy but from they can't use

838
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,278
all of the available light but warm

839
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,798
season grasses are not limited by carbon

840
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,720
dioxide

841
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:54,960
they're limited by how much light is

842
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,038
available so if we keep increasing the

843
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,679
light the grass would grow more and more

844
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:02,480
so as we start restricting the light by

845
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,640
clouds that's really meaningful for warm

846
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,278
season grasses it's not so meaningful

847
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,200
for cool season grasses and because most

848
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,639
of the turfgrass research is done in the

849
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,439
united states

850
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,358
and because most of the united states

851
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,559
where the turf grass research has done

852
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,719
seems to be

853
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,719
cool season areas i think this is

854
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,678
something that hasn't really been

855
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,519
explored in detail so people tend to

856
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,639
think that clouds don't have a huge

857
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,519
impact on

858
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,320
on how the grass will grow but it it has

859
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,398
a huge difference because

860
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,720
the weather is actually different those

861
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:39,118
charts show it when we actually go there

862
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,118
we see it and if we're in honolulu this

863
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,879
is all bermuda grass and it's just

864
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,919
thriving

865
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:48,319
and in hilo you it's we really struggle

866
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,799
to find bermuda grass where we actually

867
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,119
would this is zoysia zoysia matrella

868
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,039
manila grass we'll also find a lot of

869
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,280
carpet grass here the same grasses that

870
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:59,358
are growing in thailand the same grasses

871
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,119
that grow in south china we'll find

872
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:02,960
bermuda grass right at the base of the

873
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,200
trees and you think well wait you're

874
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,039
saying bermuda grass has a high light

875
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,078
requirement why would we find it under

876
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,559
trees

877
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:15,680
because those areas don't get mowed and

878
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:17,599
my hypothesis is or my theory is that

879
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,159
it's the mowing and cutting off the

880
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,160
leaves that disrupts the ability of the

881
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,159
bermuda grass to photosynthesize because

882
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,719
we're removing the photosynthetic

883
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,879
machinery in the leaves and so if we

884
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:32,000
don't mow the bermuda grass it can

885
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,838
persist as a weed but if we mow it it

886
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,960
gets out competed by the grasses that

887
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:39,519
can tolerate the mowing in in a type of

888
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,838
tropical environment or a subtropical

889
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,358
environment where there is a lot of

890
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,239
cloud cover

891
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,679
so here we have full sun the grasses

892
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,319
that are growing in full sun or the

893
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:53,039
grasses that in in the southeastern

894
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,079
united states would be considered the

895
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,880
shade

896
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,320
tolerant grasses

897
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,920
i want to talk a little bit about

898
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,760
management now

899
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,400
i want to talk about

900
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,640
a different way of going about thinking

901
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,039
of nutrient requirements and this kind

902
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,358
of builds on what i was doing at cornell

903
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:14,000
for my graduate research and

904
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:16,239
is also related to having to advise

905
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,079
people in so many different places and

906
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:22,399
trying to put that growth potential

907
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:24,400
model together with some good

908
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,800
soil test data

909
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,838
some better soil test data

910
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,880
research and recommendations so there's

911
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,119
five

912
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,599
key points here

913
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,920
and taken all together we come up with a

914
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,320
very simple equation to predict how much

915
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,838
fertilizer is required

916
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,960
i frank paid for a lot of tissue testing

917
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:48,960
when i was doing my research i i

918
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,519
i'm shocked looking back on it on how

919
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,440
much our laboratory fees were to do all

920
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,358
the testing but one of the valuable

921
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,400
things that came out of it is we

922
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:02,239
realized how the nutrient levels in the

923
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,400
leaves change or don't change and

924
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:07,358
in the short term we get a lot of

925
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,800
fluctuation in leaf nutrient levels but

926
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:13,440
the big picture is

927
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,440
basically the nutrient levels of turf

928
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,079
grass leaves tend to be relatively

929
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,800
constant and so we usually will have

930
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,280
about four percent nitrogen and about

931
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,440
half a percent phosphorus and about two

932
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,119
percent potassium in the leaves for

933
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,559
example so we we know basically here's

934
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,920
what's in the leaves so if we're going

935
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:35,920
to harvest the leaves and take them away

936
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,519
we should remember we know sort of

937
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,320
what's in them even without testing

938
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:45,280
so there's a chart that shows that some

939
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,680
of the elements on the x-axis

940
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,359
on the y-axis the percentage in the dry

941
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:52,559
matter of the different elements

942
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:53,679
magnesium for example would be about 0.2

943
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,119
percent

944
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,118
and

945
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,000
based on my research of hundreds of

946
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,320
samples based on lots of

947
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,079
other people's research we get this type

948
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,920
of general

949
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,920
kind of normal normal levels

950
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,200
number two the second important thing to

951
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:16,000
remember is that the amount of nitrogen

952
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:18,879
that we supply to the grass controls the

953
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,719
growth and the uptake of other nutrients

954
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,358
and this is validated by some recent

955
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,399
research in wisconsin

956
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,279
by

957
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,880
dr cousseau and others

958
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,599
and you can get this paper i put the

959
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,440
link to download this paper which is a

960
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,320
wonderful paper

961
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,320
i'm so glad they published this

962
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,200
this the link to this is in the handout

963
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,519
also

964
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:46,480
so they found nitrogen supply was the

965
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:49,119
primary determinant of turf grass growth

966
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,240
rate plant nutrient demand and nutrient

967
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,640
uptake the nitrogen uptake accounted for

968
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:57,199
over 88 percent

969
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,960
of the uptake of all other nutrients

970
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,039
and the uptake of phosphorus and

971
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,440
potassium were strongly related to

972
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,920
tissue nitrogen

973
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,079
no matter what the soil test levels were

974
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,800
which is also very similar to my

975
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,119
research it didn't matter what we did

976
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,640
with modifying the potassium levels in

977
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,680
the soil

978
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:17,679
the

979
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:20,319
amount of potassium in the leaves was

980
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:23,199
always at or above what we consider a

981
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,880
deficient level so the

982
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:28,078
the nitrogen

983
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,640
that the grass takes up is really

984
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,920
controlling this and the growth rate the

985
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:36,319
growth rate is really controlling this

986
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,559
so as the grass is growing more and as

987
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,240
we have four percent nitrogen in the

988
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,719
leaves and the grass is growing more and

989
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,639
more taking up more nitrogen it's also

990
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,399
taking up more potassium or more

991
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:47,838
phosphorus so

992
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,480
basically

993
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:53,119
what this does is allows us to sort of

994
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,079
forget about some of the other elements

995
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:59,119
and we can just assume

996
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,800
to make things simple we can just make

997
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,880
we can assume that

998
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,240
everything's present in proportion to

999
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,000
nitrogen

1000
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,078
and then if we know how much nitrogen we

1001
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,239
apply because we can use a grow

1002
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,920
temperature-based growth potential to

1003
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:13,759
predict how much nitrogen the grass will

1004
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,599
use i showed earlier how we can

1005
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,520
calculate a monthly growth potential

1006
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,160
that's from zero to one

1007
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:22,800
so if the growth potential is zero for

1008
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:25,279
example in december how much nitrogen do

1009
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,079
you think the grass will use in december

1010
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,640
zero so we'll say our maximum monthly

1011
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,720
nitrogen for cool season grass here if

1012
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:35,519
it's a sports it this is very site

1013
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:38,559
specific it depends on the grass species

1014
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,880
the desired turf performance the soil

1015
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:43,440
type but if it was a sports field we

1016
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,280
might say 4 grams or 5 grams of nitrogen

1017
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,280
per square meter per month would be the

1018
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,079
maximum we'd ever apply

1019
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,680
so we just set the maximum of 4

1020
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,240
for example let's say that's a perennial

1021
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,799
ryegrass sports field

1022
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,318
and multiply it times zero that tells us

1023
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,079
how much you know for december that

1024
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:02,800
tells us how much nitrogen we need to

1025
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,200
apply in december or how much nitrogen

1026
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,200
the grass would be using in december and

1027
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:09,039
then let's go to june when the growth

1028
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,358
potential is very high the grass is

1029
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:14,000
growing a lot if we don't apply four

1030
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:18,000
grams of nitrogen per square meter

1031
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
in that month then the gra the the the

1032
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,559
nitrogen percentage in the leaf will go

1033
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,480
down and the grass won't grow as well

1034
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:28,078
and it won't be able to respond from

1035
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,199
where so this is something that is a

1036
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,599
simple way to estimate how much nitrogen

1037
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,480
the grass may be using at any time

1038
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,559
but remember the elemental content in

1039
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,240
the leaves is relatively constant so we

1040
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,799
always have a similar proportion of

1041
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,118
potassium phosphorus

1042
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,440
magnesium calcium back to the nitrogen

1043
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,680
so if we just look at the nitrogen we

1044
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,200
can estimate how much of the other

1045
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:56,000
elements the grass is harvesting

1046
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,639
the mlsn guidelines that stands for

1047
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,960
minimum levels for sustainable nutrition

1048
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:03,279
and these are new soil test guidelines

1049
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,679
that were developed in a joint project

1050
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,000
between the asian turfgrass center and

1051
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,199
paste turf out of san diego

1052
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,239
and

1053
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:14,399
what this is is a new set of soil

1054
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:17,279
guidelines based on the malik 3 soil

1055
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,000
test extractant where we looked at

1056
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,079
over 16 000

1057
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,280
soil test

1058
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,079
results

1059
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,760
from good performing turf grass sites so

1060
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,000
because they were all from good

1061
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,720
performing turf grass sites we could say

1062
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,960
that whatever was in the soil was enough

1063
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:39,679
to produce good turf

1064
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,559
but then we modeled the distribution and

1065
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:45,358
we found what type of distribution best

1066
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:48,078
fit the data in this case it was a log

1067
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:48,078
logistic

1068
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,599
distribution and so now we get the curve

1069
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,039
and the probability density function and

1070
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,200
the cumulative

1071
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,440
density function and we can say now

1072
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,358
we're at 0.1

1073
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,358
so we're at

1074
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,838
10 percent of the samples would be below

1075
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:09,679
that 90 of the samples would be above

1076
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:12,719
that and what we did is set at the 0.1

1077
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:15,199
level we said that's for for these

1078
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:16,879
actual real data from real turf grass

1079
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:19,118
sites where the turf really was

1080
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,680
performing well we looked at those data

1081
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,160
and we didn't pick the median we didn't

1082
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:26,000
say we want to be you know in the top 50

1083
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,519
percent we're looking at what's the

1084
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,239
minimum levels

1085
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:30,159
for

1086
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,759
for nutrition but all of these were from

1087
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,239
good performing sites so we're very

1088
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,920
confident let's give ourselves a 10

1089
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,199
safety margin let's

1090
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,960
let's say

1091
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,519
10 percent of the samples were below

1092
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,480
this so let's let's say let's pick this

1093
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,239
as level as our as our minimum level

1094
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,159
so these are the guidelines and this is

1095
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,399
something that we look at as an ongoing

1096
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,960
project we're going to continuously

1097
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,960
update these as we add more data and

1098
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,358
these are significantly lower than the

1099
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,318
conventional guidelines so for example

1100
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,679
for potassium it's 33.

1101
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:03,599
there's some

1102
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,519
penn state wants like 190. it's

1103
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,079
absolutely impossible

1104
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:10,880
if anybody's watching this at penn state

1105
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:14,560
i don't understand in a sand root zone

1106
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:18,720
it's impossible to have 190 parts per

1107
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:20,559
million potassium and that's

1108
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,838
it's just impossible and the

1109
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:27,759
conventional guideline is like 50 75

1110
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:29,679
sometimes up to 110 for potassium but if

1111
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,599
we look at some of the latest research

1112
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:35,440
it suggests that 50 or 30

1113
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,838
less than 50. there was just a paper

1114
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,960
from connecticut or massachusetts where

1115
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,039
they did the

1116
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,880
from umass where they did the long term

1117
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,199
which was five years i think nitrogen

1118
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,358
and potassium application and even

1119
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:49,118
though they were below

1120
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:51,679
the conventional guidelines they didn't

1121
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,440
see a response to applied potassium so

1122
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:55,358
that suggests it's less than 50 and

1123
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,358
there's research from florida for

1124
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:00,159
bermuda grass that suggests it's about

1125
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:03,519
30. and the research that i did

1126
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:06,239
suggested it's below 50. and so the cool

1127
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:08,800
thing is these numbers that we generate

1128
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:11,519
from the mlsn guidelines we compare it

1129
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,039
to we compare it to other research it's

1130
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,239
really close it's a little bit

1131
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:18,239
conservative meaning it's safe but it's

1132
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:20,239
it's like half or less than the

1133
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:22,639
conventional guideline and it's real

1134
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:25,279
close to what seems to be

1135
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:27,519
good uh looking at phosphorus for maelic

1136
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,839
iii there's some research from wisconsin

1137
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,400
and from penn state that says maybe the

1138
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:36,880
real number where we'll get deficiency

1139
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,720
is 7 or 9 or 12. so we're at 18.

1140
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,280
but what we're saying with the mls and

1141
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:44,719
guidelines is as long as we maintain in

1142
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,800
the soil at the guideline or above

1143
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,639
we don't have to worry about adding that

1144
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,800
nutrient the grass will have access to

1145
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,039
enough of it and we only have to add

1146
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,800
that element as

1147
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,838
we get below

1148
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,560
below as we approach that number

1149
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,559
and we're making this also a citizen

1150
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,519
science project we just introduced the

1151
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:07,039
global soil survey for sustainable turf

1152
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,119
and we're hoping that hundreds or

1153
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:11,599
thousands of people from around the

1154
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,559
world will contribute samples from their

1155
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,280
site

1156
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:19,440
in order to help validate this for a

1157
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,160
wider range of areas and for a wide

1158
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,679
range of turf grasses

1159
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,960
so those levels were

1160
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,519
warm and cool

1161
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,599
as far as we know they work warm and

1162
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,358
cool and if

1163
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,838
anybody

1164
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,679
has any better information we're very

1165
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,799
public about this we have a facebook

1166
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:41,118
page we please contact us and let us

1167
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,039
know that these numbers are wrong and we

1168
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,440
eventually will actually share the data

1169
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,599
and we'll share the software we're right

1170
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,400
we're we're working with our

1171
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,000
software and writing some scripts

1172
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,119
i would hope people at cornell are also

1173
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,280
using that it's it's awesome

1174
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:00,480
so we're writing scripts to to do this

1175
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,480
so

1176
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,199
we will share that code also so people

1177
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,599
can can see exactly what we've done so

1178
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:08,399
we're we're trying to be very open about

1179
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,280
this

1180
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,599
and

1181
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,680
we look at it as just an ongoing project

1182
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,240
where we continually make these numbers

1183
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,838
better and better i'm sure that because

1184
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,679
of the way we're doing this eventually

1185
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:23,318
this is going to be the standard

1186
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:23,318
soil test recommendation

1187
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,519
so if we consider those previous points

1188
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,318
mathematically the minimum nutrient

1189
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:34,559
requirement can be determined be it's

1190
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:36,880
very simple i'm not going to explain it

1191
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,839
right here it's in the handout and you

1192
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,400
can see some more examples of that in

1193
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,078
the handout and i link to other articles

1194
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,440
i've written where i explained it

1195
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,000
explicitly

1196
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,440
but basically all we need to do

1197
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,639
is we estimate the harvest or we measure

1198
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,318
the harvest

1199
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,960
so we know how much of an element we've

1200
00:47:54,318 --> 00:48:00,239
harvested we add that to the mlsn

1201
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,639
guideline which makes sure that we're

1202
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,159
keeping that amount in the soil and then

1203
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:06,558
we subtract the amount that's on the

1204
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:08,000
soil test if that's a positive number

1205
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,640
that's how much of that element we need

1206
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,239
to apply if that's a negative number

1207
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:16,400
that means there's that much excess of

1208
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:18,799
that element in the soil even accounting

1209
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,200
for for we're assuming we're harvesting

1210
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,079
all the clippings and we can estimate

1211
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,879
the

1212
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,880
the clipping yield based on on whatever

1213
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,599
percent nitrogen there is in the leaves

1214
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,760
so

1215
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,760
we

1216
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,920
we can do that that's all explained in

1217
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,480
the handout if you're into turf and want

1218
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,318
to see how we can do this so

1219
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,000
that is

1220
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:44,400
something that

1221
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,079
we just recently did in the last couple

1222
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,680
of years and we're still

1223
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,599
working on this but we think that this

1224
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:51,679
will be the way that people

1225
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,599
choose to fertilize if they want to make

1226
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:57,039
sure that they're applying the minimum

1227
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:59,200
amount of fertilizer necessary to to

1228
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:01,838
create still create high quality turf

1229
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:04,399
grass conditions but not apply any

1230
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:06,639
excess fertilizer

1231
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,119
so there's more information at my

1232
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:10,159
website i will post these slides and the

1233
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,880
handout

1234
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:12,558
and

1235
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,880
the handout has links to all of the

1236
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,440
websites i went to and links to lots

1237
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,559
more additional reading so that will be

1238
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,760
on my blog which you can access from

1239
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:25,319
asianturfgrass.com tonight

1240
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,319
thank you very much

1241
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:39,319
this has been a production of cornell
