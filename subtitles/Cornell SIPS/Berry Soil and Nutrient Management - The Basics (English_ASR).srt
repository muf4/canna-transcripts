now thanks

57
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,479
Kathy I'm going to take a couple minutes

58
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,239
in the beginning part of this

59
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:53,479
presentation to talk to you a little bit

60
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:58,280
about soil testing uh soil

61
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:58,280
sampling and we'll start off

62
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,799
uh talking to you a little bit about

63
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,840
soil and tissue testing it's it's pretty

64
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,799
hard to manage a crop unless you have

65
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,400
some pieces of information to help you

66
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,879
manage that crop and that's really where

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,719
soil sampling soil testing and tissue

68
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:22,199
testing come in

69
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,280
um there's definitely two main time

70
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,039
frames that uh we talk about when we

71
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,759
talk about uh sampling and that's

72
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,438
pre-plant so if you're planting an exp

73
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,399
expensive crop like raspberries or

74
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:38,438
blueberries and you want to prepare uh

75
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,438
the soil beforehand so that you have the

76
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:42,359
least amount of obstacles and the most

77
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:45,120
Optimum conditions for those expensive

78
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,040
crops is a great opportunity to take

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,039
soil

80
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:52,798
tests um and get analyses back and have

81
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,078
time to actually make some adjustments

82
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,599
and for these crops one of the major

83
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,000
things that you have to think about is

84
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,158
uh things like soil drainage as a

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,360
possibility getting irrigation to the

86
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,078
site as a second possibility but really

87
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,959
what we're talking about today is uh the

88
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,680
fertility management and one of the

89
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,719
things that you can change is pH if you

90
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,400
plan on doing a blueberry planting you

91
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,439
know that you want to get the PH down

92
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:23,120
into the uh fours at least mid fours and

93
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:25,478
if you do not do a soil pH test in

94
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,079
advance of the planting then you're

95
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:30,639
probably not going to have enough time

96
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,839
to modify that pH

97
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,280
and have it down in the range that's

98
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,279
optimal for that crop and the same would

99
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,959
be true in acid soils and bringing them

100
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,079
up to six or 65 depending on whether

101
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,478
you're going to go with raspberries or

102
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,000
strawberries so it's a real opportune

103
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,800
time to take those

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,360
samples uh another time to think about

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,520
soil sampling is after the planting is

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,120
already in and this is the case where

107
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:59,719
you're talking about maintaining a

108
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:03,038
viable stand at Optimal Performance and

109
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,160
taking samples of soil uh running them

110
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,399
through a lab and getting an analysis

111
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,639
back and and then making sure that

112
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:13,599
there's no um maor major shortages of

113
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,079
any important nutrients and if there are

114
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,400
uh making sure that you're applying

115
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:20,318
those nutrients in adequate quantities

116
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,079
to optimize both crop yield and

117
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,600
quality a last thing that Growers should

118
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,879
consider is protecting the

119
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,240
environment so if you look at it and you

120
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:32,240
say to the average grower how much do

121
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,280
you play how much do you apply and do

122
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,439
you do soil testing there's often enough

123
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,159
times where you hear the answer I I

124
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,160
don't really do an awful lot of soil

125
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,319
sampling but I make sure uh that I never

126
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,439
short the crop so that means that

127
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,759
there's a possibility that there's over

128
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,839
fertilization going on and that can be

129
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,400
very costly and depending on the

130
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:56,359
nutrient that could have some

131
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,359
environmental ramifications as

132
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:04,799
well now just talking you about the the

133
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,120
basic uh types of testing uh the

134
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,918
standard soil test which is a chemical

135
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,879
analysis uh the cornal soil heal Health

136
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:16,639
test and tissue analysis if you look at

137
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,319
a standard soil test um it's it's

138
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,519
something that's conducted at many Labs

139
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,598
across the states and the attempt is to

140
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,560
measure the availability of of essential

141
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:30,120
nutrients for

142
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,079
plants so each lab has their own setup

143
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,360
um their own

144
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:38,318
procedures um their own uh materials

145
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,960
used to leech out nutrients and and

146
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,240
measurements taken on the quantity of

147
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,318
those nutrients that are then reported

148
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,720
back to the

149
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,759
Growers um in in New York State uh

150
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,039
Cornell has done an awful lot of field

151
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,479
research and done some tests to look at

152
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:59,159
what is in the soil and application

153
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,399
rates and the response application rates

154
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,680
given

155
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,918
uh different soil levels of those

156
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,560
nutrients uh so that's the basic

157
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,839
chemical analysis that people would get

158
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,759
reports back interpret them and and

159
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,799
adjust their fertility and pH

160
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,160
accordingly the Cornell soil Health test

161
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,000
is a unique test looking at some of the

162
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,400
other attributes of the soil and that's

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,160
the biological aspects and the physical

164
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,519
aspects of the soil and how they impact

165
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,240
plant growth and development and Laura

166
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,680
is going to be talking to you about that

167
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,478
a little bit later in this presentation

168
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,959
and then finally tissue

169
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:37,159
analysis uh this is a great uh way to

170
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,799
measure what actually the plant is

171
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,879
seeing in the way of nutrients if you do

172
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,478
soil tests you can see oh well this is

173
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,520
what we have in the soil but the tissue

174
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,719
analysis tells you what the plant is

175
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:51,198
taking up from the soil and Kathy is

176
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,720
going to talk to you a little bit more

177
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,720
about that

178
00:07:53,918 --> 00:08:00,359
later there's two basic times that you

179
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,800
would look at testing one

180
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,158
is the routine measurements you know if

181
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,680
you have an established planting you

182
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:10,759
take samples every 3 years you look at

183
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,280
the results you make some minor

184
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,360
modifications uh adding phosphorus when

185
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,638
it's needed or uh modifying the pH if

186
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,360
it's needed either down or up depending

187
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,879
upon the crop Andor if you have a

188
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,639
situation where you have no history of a

189
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,039
site at all and you plan on putting a

190
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,319
planting of uh perennial Berry like

191
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,278
blueberry into an area it's great

192
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,519
opportunity to do that soil test at that

193
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,679
time that's more of the routine types of

194
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,320
tests that are

195
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:43,439
conducted uh there's definitely um a

196
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,760
chance to use soil testing and fer

197
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,560
analysis to do diagnostic work when

198
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,360
plants are not doing as well as you

199
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,559
think they should uh and it's just one

200
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,919
piece of the in of of information that

201
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,518
you can use to help come up with answers

202
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:03,039
uh for local Growers to actually

203
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:06,360
identify what the problem is on the site

204
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,719
and usually this is done with doing some

205
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,240
paired sampling so taking a series of

206
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,320
samples in an area that is just not

207
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,720
performing up to par and then comparing

208
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,560
them with at least the results of those

209
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,278
chemical analyses with an area of the

210
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:26,359
field where you have reasonable

211
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:29,439
performance um in these situations

212
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,600
adding soluble salts as an analysis is

213
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,040
probably an important thing to do and

214
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,519
using plant tissue analysis just gives

215
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:39,480
you that additional piece of information

216
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,959
that you can use in in a answering a

217
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,240
battery of questions and narrowing down

218
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,239
the field to the the

219
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,319
problem now it's important to to look at

220
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:57,879
how you'd want to obtain a

221
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,800
sample uh in the case of

222
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:03,559
uh the

223
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:06,838
identification you can see that in by

224
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:08,559
the Green Arrow there's an area of uh

225
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,600
sweet corn in this case that's not

226
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,799
performing very well and yet uh a

227
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,399
majority of the rest of the planting is

228
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,919
doing very well this is an opportunity

229
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,639
to take some samples to identify what

230
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:23,879
the problem might be so in sampling

231
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,639
these areas you'd want to take a series

232
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,360
of samples from the area that's not

233
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,519
performing well and you should take a

234
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,000
minimum of eight uh

235
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,278
subsamples that are then mixed together

236
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,078
as a single sample from both the problem

237
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:44,000
area as well as the area that's more

238
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:46,799
representative of good performance so

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,958
that's one sampling strategy another

240
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:52,838
important uh thing to consider when

241
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:56,159
you're uh sampling is actually to sample

242
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,720
by management unit so you can picture

243
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:02,159
your farm and you can picture block

244
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,720
planting of that farm over time you

245
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,958
would want to First Look at the soil

246
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,480
types that are underneath these

247
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,679
plantings and if there are major changes

248
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,079
in soil type to actually sample within

249
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:17,679
those soil types because there can be

250
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:20,439
very big differences in their ability to

251
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,439
hold on to nutrients the amount of lime

252
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,399
or sulfur that's needed to change the pH

253
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,519
depending on the texture differences

254
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,078
between those soil types so that's the

255
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,440
starting point but beyond that you may

256
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:37,759
have a planting of strawberries that's

257
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,839
newly planted and that should be sampled

258
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,439
uh separately than plantings that are

259
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,920
two and three years old and even within

260
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,560
those plantings maybe have different

261
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:49,240
varieties planted you should be

262
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,278
considering them as management units and

263
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,278
doing sampling separately for those

264
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:57,720
management units and then using it as a

265
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,240
diagnostic tool is is yet the other

266
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,000
method

267
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,480
so talking about a a sampling of soils

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,240
for chemical

269
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,278
analysis um there are different labs

270
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,839
they use various extractants to estimate

271
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,159
how much plant available nutrients are

272
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,320
in that

273
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:21,399
sample um and yes the values that you

274
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,278
can get from the same sample can be very

275
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,799
different from different

276
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,120
labs and the important thing to take

277
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:32,519
home out of that is not to take values

278
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:36,399
from one lab results and try to uh make

279
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:39,799
recommendations using another lab's

280
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,639
information so in in New York state the

281
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:45,559
recommendation is to go with Cornell

282
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,720
soil sample analysis and that is being

283
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:52,078
conducted by a private firm Dair

284
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,879
1 uh because then you get the power of

285
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,799
the university and all the trials that

286
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,078
are conducted and the information

287
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:01,838
gleaned from those trials and the

288
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,838
recommendations that come from those

289
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:09,120
trials so Agra one is the place to go in

290
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,958
New York

291
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,879
State uh mainly because you get the

292
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,559
benefit of the Cornell recommendations

293
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,559
which are based on Research

294
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,120
results there are a certain set of

295
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,320
sampling tools that can be used in a

296
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,320
obtaining soil samples uh in the upper

297
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,519
right you can see series of those tools

298
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,760
um you have an

299
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:44,159
orur uh soil probe head um and you can

300
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:46,319
see that they're made from stainless

301
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:50,000
steel one of the one of the important

302
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,879
things to avoid is contamination of the

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,720
sample so if you use you know steel

304
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:58,799
shovels um Spades to obtain the sample

305
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,879
and they haven't been cared for and

306
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,599
there's some rust on them that can

307
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,159
actually contaminate the sample another

308
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,519
thing to think about when you're taking

309
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,559
a sample is you're trying to be as

310
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,039
representative of the situation as

311
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:16,399
possible it is just a sample from the

312
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:18,679
field so getting to the same depth

313
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,320
consistently making sure you have have

314
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:24,399
the same volume of soil that's obtained

315
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,120
at each site and then mixing each one of

316
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,440
the subsamples to come up with a

317
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,440
composite for an entire area all those

318
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:37,360
things uh give you good information if

319
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,759
you got too much sample from one site

320
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,039
and uh Not Enough From Another now

321
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,320
you're actually weighing the sample

322
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,480
results and if you don't have sufficient

323
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,759
numbers of samples you can definitely

324
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,720
have some errors in the information that

325
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:53,320
you're going to get from the sample

326
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,440
results uh another thing to consider is

327
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,519
to make sure that you're using a plastic

328
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,639
bucket you know some buckets are made

329
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,919
from zinc and zinc can contaminate the

330
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,278
sample as well and the third thing is

331
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:06,599
make sure that you're using the

332
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:09,120
appropriate forms and appropriate

333
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:13,199
procedures in uh putting together the

334
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,198
sample uh to send it off to the

335
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,519
lab now looking a little more closely at

336
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:21,638
the soil probe this is a favorite among

337
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,159
a lot of people and the reason why it's

338
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:28,159
a favorite is you have this tube uh

339
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:31,278
that's attached to a t you can press

340
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:33,399
this into a soil get a nice core sample

341
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,958
to the depth that you're uh that you

342
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:39,278
want to go to clear this tube and then

343
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,879
move on to your next site so under good

344
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:45,318
conditions so that's not too wet not too

345
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:48,240
dry and definitely not Rocky or grally

346
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:51,198
um you can do this uh very

347
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,440
quickly uh and so a lot of people use

348
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,039
this particular device to uptain samples

349
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,639
I will say one of the things that I do

350
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:01,759
is whatever depth uh I'm going to

351
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,600
for a specific crop I'll measure it

352
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,680
right on the probe and then I'll put a

353
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,959
piece of electrical tape around the tube

354
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,838
at that height so that I consistently go

355
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:15,078
to that same

356
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,440
level looking at the orur the orur is a

357
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:19,399
great tool under Rocky and wet

358
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,920
conditions if it's too wet and you use

359
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,198
the soil probe anybody that's done this

360
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,559
you press it in the ground you pull it

361
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:28,958
back up and only half the tube is

362
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,679
actually filled because you actually

363
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,958
compressed the soil when it was wet and

364
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,519
and you didn't get a full tube worth of

365
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:39,879
sample uh so under wetter conditions the

366
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:42,078
soil actually adheres to the augur and

367
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:44,198
you just run your hand down the augur to

368
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,799
clear that and you've got a reasonable

369
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:49,719
sample the same thing can be done with

370
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,758
the augur where you measure uh let's say

371
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:57,440
8 in from the

372
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:59,079
tip uh to the top and make sure and put

373
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,759
your electrical tape there and then you

374
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:04,720
know that you're going to that depth

375
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,679
consistently another benefit of the ogre

376
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,558
is that you can actually set them up so

377
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,319
that you can put them on a power drill

378
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,038
if you're doing a lot of samples and

379
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:15,639
some

380
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:18,439
uh thought has gone into this where

381
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,120
people have cut a hole inside a

382
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,160
container like a bucket a plastic bucket

383
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,198
and actually run the orar right through

384
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,160
the bucket through the hole into the

385
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,360
soil and bring it back up and they clear

386
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,519
it right there and the samples trapped

387
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,918
in the

388
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:39,279
bucket so pretty efficient way of

389
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,720
sampling as was mentioned before you

390
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,599
definitely want to uh take at least a

391
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,319
minimum number of samples to get a good

392
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:48,879
representation of Any Given area another

393
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:51,240
thing that you should consider is never

394
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,120
do uh sampling in let's say straight

395
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,240
lines why is that because a lot of times

396
00:17:54,119 --> 00:18:00,719
we are uh running in straight lines up

397
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,480
and down Fields with our equipment with

398
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,200
fertilizer uh and planting maybe doing

399
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:10,798
drainage work and if you sample over

400
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,120
that same uh area consistently across

401
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,400
the field you actually are not

402
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,759
representing all the rest of the area

403
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,200
and you may actually be tainting the

404
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:23,000
results so usually the recommendation is

405
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,640
to Zig and zag across an area to obtain

406
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,159
a sample so that you're getting a good

407
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:33,200
representation of the entire area

408
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:35,720
to start sampling you always remove uh

409
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,240
the organic debris that's at the surface

410
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,440
because that will uh change the

411
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,919
results uh you make sure that you know

412
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,400
the depth at which you should be

413
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,280
sampling for the crop that you're

414
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,120
actually sampling for and it would

415
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:50,960
definitely be different depths for tree

416
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:54,558
fruits versus small fruits versus things

417
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,038
like field crops um and turf grass so

418
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,639
make sure that you know the depth for

419
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:00,240
the crop that you're actually sampling

420
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:04,320
for um you should definitely take 8 to

421
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,720
10 sub samples at a minimum in an area

422
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,200
anything less than two acres and

423
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,759
anything greater than two acres you

424
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,600
should have 10 to 20 subsamples as a

425
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:16,119
minimum uh in larger acreages you want

426
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,119
at least a minimum of three subsamples

427
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:19,000
per

428
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,959
acre uh

429
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,679
for uh sampling for berries uh both

430
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,880
pre-plant and uh established plantings

431
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,919
you want to go down to 8 in depth

432
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,240
um and then in established plantings you

433
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:36,038
want to pair up the soil sample results

434
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,120
with tissue analysis and Cathy will talk

435
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:41,519
to you a little bit more about that

436
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:44,519
later uh additional guidelines remember

437
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,599
to remove that organic mat uh to go to

438
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:50,400
the depth that's uh

439
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:52,918
recommended uh taking each subsample

440
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,559
putting it into the plastic bucket uh at

441
00:19:52,919 --> 00:20:00,038
the end of sampling a particular area

442
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:02,319
mix well uh because now that uh is going

443
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:04,558
to represent that area and then you

444
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:08,558
subsample from it to get your sample to

445
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:11,839
send off to the lab if the sample is uh

446
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:15,200
too wet then put it on something like a

447
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:17,639
plastic plate uh put a fan on it to air

448
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,679
dry it avoid using any kind of heat

449
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,280
Source because that can definitely skew

450
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,360
the results especially

451
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,319
nitrogen uh and then make sure that you

452
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,558
put it in the appropriate container for

453
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,119
the lab that you're sending it to and

454
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:31,119
make sure that you're forms are

455
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,439
completely filled out because they use

456
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,439
that information in making the

457
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:39,640
recommendations uh in New York state

458
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,600
they have mapped the soils out they've

459
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,840
actually done it in the whole us but

460
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,599
they use the soil

461
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:50,199
names uh in New York state um to provide

462
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:53,279
information about uh yield capacity of

463
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,798
the site and some of the physical

464
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,558
attributes of the soil and its ability

465
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:01,519
to hold on to nutrients so it's

466
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:02,599
important to to put the soil series name

467
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,960
on the

468
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:08,439
form uh indicating for the area that

469
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,200
you're sampling for your crop because

470
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,080
that is a valuable piece of information

471
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,319
that adds into the recommendation in

472
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,558
fact you won't get a recommendation

473
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:20,038
without having that information on the

474
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:25,759
form um uh so you can go online and use

475
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:30,079
web soil survey. nrcs uh. usda.gov

476
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:32,400
and uh get the soil survey uh for your

477
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,158
farm and then specifically get down to

478
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,440
the field level and indicate what soil

479
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,840
series name is most predominant in the

480
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,080
field or the area that you're intending

481
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,240
to

482
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:47,439
sample uh there's actually an iPhone app

483
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,759
um and you can uh get this from this

484
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,960
presentation and actually use that to

485
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:56,400
find the soil name for your particular

486
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,038
location uh Andor if if you don't want

487
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,840
to go either of those routes you can go

488
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:03,798
to corporative Extension Office often

489
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,759
they have copies of uh the same

490
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:09,679
materials and can help you to identify

491
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,679
the soil name for your

492
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:18,000
field uh interpreting the results uh can

493
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,400
be challenging um if you go to an outof

494
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,400
State lab they might send you results

495
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,400
back uh just indicating the pounds of

496
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:30,200
particular nutrients that are tested in

497
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,038
the sample and no recommendation s um

498
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,919
and that's why it's important to really

499
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:39,158
use the the lab that's in your state

500
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:41,919
that uh is associated with um a local

501
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:44,120
land grant institution and can provide

502
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,679
recommendations just a simple thing like

503
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:49,158
checking your soil PH uh you definitely

504
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,240
have to have the information ahead of

505
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,720
time that if you're growing strawberries

506
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,640
or raspberries that the pH that is

507
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,200
recommended that's optimal for those

508
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,640
crops is between 6.2 and 6.5 versus

509
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,679
blueberries uh much lower at 4.2 to

510
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,840
4.5 you look at the results and say okay

511
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:12,000
are my macronutrients uh do they fall

512
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:14,119
into the medium range or above and if

513
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,839
not then I need to make some adjustments

514
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,678
in that here's the recommendation on the

515
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:21,359
soil sample results uh what's your soil

516
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:23,240
organic matter content uh for most Berry

517
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,000
crops it's recommended to have 3% or

518
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,519
higher and again this is one of those

519
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,558
things if you test the site beforehand

520
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,558
you have a chance to build up organic

521
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:34,440
matter levels if you need to uh the

522
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,480
calcium levels are very important for

523
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,880
blueberry production and the

524
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,880
recommendation is when you're looking at

525
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:44,200
a Cornell soil test results through Agro

526
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,760
one that uh calcium be below 2,000

527
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,759
lounds per acre and aluminum can be

528
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:52,879
toxic at higher levels so if you see a

529
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:56,759
reading of 300 lbs of aluminum in your

530
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,840
sample per acre uh then this is a

531
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,599
situation that you're going to have to

532
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,599
correct very quickly uh and that can

533
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,798
occur more and will occur more under

534
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:06,599
acid soils and definitely there's a

535
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,400
recommendation not to use any kind of

536
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:09,399
aluminum based

537
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:20,519
fertilizers so just a a quick word about

538
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,919
soil PH if you look at this graph it's

539
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:24,960
it's one that probably you've seen

540
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,640
before that indicates the availability

541
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,440
of uh some major uh necessary nutrients

542
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,440
for your plant growth and development um

543
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,960
and it just shows the The Wider the band

544
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:41,880
The more available those nutrients are

545
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:47,558
so you can see that in the PH range of

546
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:50,840
let's say six to 7 you find that most

547
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:53,398
nutrients have a high availability as

548
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:56,798
you go towards strongly acid the

549
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:58,678
availability of many nutrients falls off

550
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:02,759
and that can affect the performance of

551
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:05,519
your plants or if the pH gets driven way

552
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,960
up you can have that same situation at

553
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,158
least for a series of these nutrients

554
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,278
that are necessary for crop growth and

555
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,720
development so it's very important for

556
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:19,278
you to understand that relationship and

557
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,038
how important it is to have the pH um in

558
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:25,679
the soil at an optimal level for the

559
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:25,679
crop that you're growing

560
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,519
uh when you're modifying uh soil soil PH

561
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,599
one of the things that you should be

562
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:43,879
aware of is that it isn't instantaneous

563
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:46,678
you can't just apply lime to increase

564
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:49,799
the pH or sulfur to decrease the pH one

565
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,840
day and have the pH Changed by the next

566
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:56,200
day in fact it's a long-term process and

567
00:25:52,839 --> 00:26:00,278
takes from six months to nine months to

568
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:03,960
occur um so this is better that you

569
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:07,000
pre-plan uh do the testing

570
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,798
beforehand uh make adjustments in the in

571
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,519
PH through these

572
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,918
applications and do that nine months or

573
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,200
more in advance of actually planting the

574
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,840
intended

575
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,000
crop and if you want more information on

576
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:27,319
this you can go to the production guide

577
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,319
for Berry crops put out by n rce

578
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,519
this is what you might expect this is

579
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:38,719
what you would get from dairy 1

580
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:42,200
uh as far as uh a results form and you

581
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,440
can see that they have a nice graphic in

582
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:49,640
the upper right which shows you very low

583
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,360
low medium high and very high levels of

584
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,320
some of your major

585
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,879
macronutrients and you can see for

586
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:58,960
instance that phosphorus is uh in the

587
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,600
low medium level and probably would need

588
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,319
to be built up with additional

589
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,398
applications uh potassium is already

590
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:09,240
high so pretty

591
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:14,639
reasonable calcium we talked about that

592
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:18,200
2,000 lounds of calcium uh per acre

593
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,120
being an indicator of uh uh at least

594
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:26,000
above that being a problem for Blu Ray

595
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:28,839
production um pH uh 6.1 and looking at

596
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,720
strawberries as the intended crop we're

597
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:34,158
you know close to the range that's

598
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,360
recommended and then organic matter we

599
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,080
talked about the fact that you wanted 3%

600
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:41,719
or more and in this case you have

601
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:46,000
4.6% aluminum we said that you had to

602
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,880
have 300 lb per acre or more to have

603
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,919
problems with toxicity from aluminum and

604
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,960
it looks like we're okay in this

605
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,799
case uh nitrogen recommendations from

606
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,319
this

607
00:27:53,798 --> 00:28:02,639
sample uh 100 pounds of nitrogen total

608
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:06,319
to be split 80 lbs in July 20 lbs in the

609
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:10,200
following September and then 25 lbs of

610
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,200
phosphorus fertilizer at

611
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:18,439
planting and when it comes to uh

612
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,480
bringing those nutrient levels up to

613
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,240
recommended levels it's it's really the

614
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,200
same the the soil test results will tell

615
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:32,798
you okay you need so many pounds of uh

616
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,319
p25 or k2o poach or phosphorus nitrogen

617
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,000
and really it's when you talk about

618
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,879
organic versus conventional it's just

619
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,720
the source that you're changing so the

620
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,360
percentage of nutrients found in organic

621
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,600
fertilizers is usually lower than those

622
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:50,719
found in uh conventional

623
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:52,798
fertilizers but if you're told to put on

624
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,200
30 lbs of

625
00:28:52,798 --> 00:29:00,359
nitrogen uh then you just have to put on

626
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:03,880
more material uh the organic uh type of

627
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:07,000
fertilizer to achieve the same 30 pounds

628
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,120
of nitrogen contribution to that crop

629
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,720
and you have two really really really

630
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:14,239
good guides the organic strawberry and

631
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,640
organic blueberry production guides to

632
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:22,359
help you uh find sources of

633
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:25,480
fertilizers and you know bring those uh

634
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:28,599
uh soils up to spec for uh optimal

635
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,839
production of those crops and with that

636
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,678
I think I'm going to be turning this

637
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:34,558
over to

638
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,840
Laura uh for further discussion about

639
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:42,960
the Cornell soil Health

640
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:45,480
test all right thank you Jeff um so we

641
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,679
talked a little bit about one aspect of

642
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,000
the cornal soil Health test which was

643
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,000
the chemical evaluation of the soil but

644
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,759
a higher level of testing involves

645
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,359
evaluation of biological and physical

646
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:02,079
properties of the soil in addition to

647
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:03,918
the chemical ones that Jeff um explained

648
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,639
and those are measured in the S standard

649
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:10,360
soil nutrient test um all three of the

650
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,360
components biological physical and

651
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:15,359
chemical um are interact to provide

652
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,439
conditions that could lead to Optimal

653
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,678
plant

654
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,880
performance chemical properties are the

655
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:24,038
most understood and they're the easiest

656
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,480
to modify of those three but we can also

657
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:29,119
influence soil physical and biological

658
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,919
properties to in to enance plant

659
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:35,119
performance and that's why um the soil

660
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:37,679
Health test is so valuable because it

661
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:41,599
gives us some idea of what some of those

662
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,080
constraints might be so this is um a

663
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,599
slide that explains a little bit the

664
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:48,720
Cornell soil Health test was developed

665
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:51,798
by the Cornell nutrient analysis lab and

666
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:56,120
there's um a whole team of folks that

667
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:58,759
work on uh soil Health at Cornell uh not

668
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:59,599
just erronous but um

669
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,599
uh

670
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:07,599
horticulturists uh soil scientists Etc

671
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:09,599
and they came up with um the Cornell uh

672
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,398
soil Health assessment training manual

673
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,879
which is right here you can order this

674
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:15,839
online it's

675
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,120
downloadable um and it's very helpful

676
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,558
for folks that are just beginning to

677
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:24,158
understand what soil Health could mean

678
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,759
uh this is the address and the website

679
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,080
uh that you can get more information

680
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:31,398
about this process and and there's basic

681
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:34,960
packages and standard packages and the

682
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:38,638
basic is really for uh grain and forage

683
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,720
crops um and other non-agricultural

684
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:43,638
applications uh especially used for

685
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,720
landscaping and site remediation but for

686
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:48,519
us with specialty crops um the standard

687
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,679
package is what we are recommending that

688
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:54,638
you get and um this is used a lot in

689
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,559
vegetable production organic producers

690
00:31:54,638 --> 00:32:01,798
uh are very interested in this um

691
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,839
information some problem diagnosis again

692
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:06,558
in landscaping and urban

693
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:09,158
applications and for for Berry crop

694
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:12,398
Growers and tree Fruit Growers uh any

695
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:15,639
especially perennial um plant Growers

696
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:18,038
the best time for us to take advantage

697
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:22,398
of what the soil Health test can offer

698
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:24,839
is for first time soil Health

699
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:27,918
assessment so soil health is the

700
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:30,638
capacity of the soil to function

701
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,038
chemically biologically and physically

702
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:33,599
and that's what we're going to explore a

703
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:37,278
little bit and that's what the soil

704
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:40,599
Health test will um make sure that that

705
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:44,038
folks understand so characteristics of

706
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:47,158
healthy soils include good tilth

707
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:50,319
sufficient but not excessive amounts of

708
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:53,080
nutrients um a sufficient rooting

709
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:55,359
depth a healthy soil has good water

710
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:57,439
storage and also excellent drainage

711
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,240
those are very important in Berry Crop

712
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,080
Production

713
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,960
um it is free of chemicals that might

714
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,879
harm plants and has relatively low

715
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,960
populations of plant disease and

716
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,679
parasitic organisms but High populations

717
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,480
of beneficial

718
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:18,200
organisms healthy soil has um lower weed

719
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,120
pressure um and it is has some

720
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,360
resistance to being

721
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:26,558
degraded and all of these um help it

722
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:29,558
become more resilient so it's actually

723
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:32,278
quick it has a capacity to recover

724
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:34,918
quickly from Adverse Events and those

725
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:37,880
are characteristics of healthy

726
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:41,440
soil some characteristics or signs of

727
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:44,039
poor soil Health include um when you

728
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,240
plow up clot soil and you have poor seed

729
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:50,879
beds those are signs that you might have

730
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:56,120
uh poor soil you might have hard soil at

731
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:58,320
planting uh it it tends to um kind of

732
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:00,599
get that uh surface soil

733
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:04,359
hardness on it which is a real

734
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:06,959
problem um there could be rapid onset or

735
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:09,639
of stress or stunted growth during dry

736
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,079
or wet periods that's a sign of

737
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:16,119
unhealthy and poor soil and it can also

738
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:19,519
have poor growth the Vigor on the plants

739
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:21,960
is just not great at all you might see

740
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:24,000
in poor soil declining yields that

741
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,480
actually is one of the biggest tip offs

742
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,918
to Growers that there's something

743
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,760
happening their yield just keep keep

744
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:33,118
going down regardless of how much

745
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,040
fertilizer or uh organic matter they

746
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,838
might be

747
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:40,000
adding and that this also can exacerbate

748
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:43,719
High disease pressure when you get uh

749
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,398
poor Vigor a lot of times diseases take

750
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:49,638
advantage of that and then that you

751
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:53,480
might see signs of runoff and erosion so

752
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:57,320
those are are pretty obvious poor soil

753
00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:00,280
signs um so some of the interactions and

754
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,960
this is what um the soil Health test

755
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,320
will help delineate or help make obvious

756
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,679
is some of the things that they will

757
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:11,559
indicate to you will have

758
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:14,559
interaction and so uh hard soil reduces

759
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:16,920
rooting but why why is that happen it

760
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:20,159
could be compacted dense soil layers

761
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,720
restrict rooting volume um and then it's

762
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,879
not the plants are not able to exploit

763
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:28,159
water and nutrients the way they should

764
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,680
be compacted soil can also supress

765
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:35,679
beneficial biological processes and so

766
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:39,239
you see in blue um is the physical

767
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:41,279
attribute and then in green nutrients

768
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:44,479
and root diseases and denitrification

769
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,680
all are chemical aspects and and the

770
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,599
yellow is the biological so Poe drainage

771
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:55,039
reduces rooting and aerobic biological

772
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:58,119
processes and then the compaction which

773
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:00,239
a hard soil um often you you have

774
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:03,800
compaction that will increase root

775
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:06,598
diseases and denitrification losses so

776
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:09,119
that's an example of all three of the

777
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:15,400
characteristics the soil characteristics

778
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:18,358
having an interaction um around hard

779
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,880
soil so some of the things that the

780
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:24,400
Cornell soil Health test will do is that

781
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,760
there's a battery of tests that uh are

782
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,960
employed and um some of these are done

783
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,359
in the soil Health the photos of The

784
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,559
Suite of

785
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:37,358
analyses um the soil physical tests in

786
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:40,239
are in the blue across the top these are

787
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:42,318
all laborator laboratory tests except

788
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,439
the field penetration test and we'll

789
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:47,440
talk about using that soil

790
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,838
penetrometer um a little bit later and

791
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,079
then the biological tests are in green

792
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:55,960
across the bottom the soil Health uh lab

793
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:59,640
uses a modified Morgan

794
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,119
extraction um solution to determine soil

795
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,598
nutrient levels and then the soil

796
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:08,960
texture determination is also used to

797
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:08,960
cat categorize test

798
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:14,279
results Cornell soil heal Health test

799
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:16,919
guidelines and this is just some things

800
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,400
that you'll need in in the field

801
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,000
basically I find that it's easier for me

802
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:25,160
to take this test if I have an assistant

803
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,639
somebody to help carry some of the gear

804
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:30,519
but if you're alone you'll definitely

805
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:32,759
need two um 5 gallon buckets and one of

806
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:36,119
them would be for soil We Gather much

807
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:39,200
more soil in this particular test than

808
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:43,599
you do for a chemical soil analysis you

809
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:46,239
want a large 1gallon Ziploc bag to uh

810
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:50,318
put all of the soil sample in at the end

811
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:53,919
of the uh Gathering it you'll want a 600

812
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:56,279
mil or plastic Beaker a 3 cup capacity

813
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,800
you'll want a permanent marker and

814
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,680
Pen I use a trow or a spade and I

815
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,000
actually use a larger kind of a tree

816
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:09,000
spade type thing and uh that helps a lot

817
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,400
to gather that soil you want a a soil

818
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,559
penetrometer um a grower and field

819
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,440
information sheet and a clipboard uh to

820
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:21,039
hold that information on and so this um

821
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,920
right here uh is an example of that um

822
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:27,920
soil Health uh field information sheet

823
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,920
that you'll be filling out

824
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:34,318
so these are rather important guidelines

825
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:36,480
and the sampling will be done roughly in

826
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:38,719
the same manner for the standard

827
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,039
chemical soil like the nutrient soil

828
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:44,279
test with some of these

829
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:47,358
exceptions you want to sample the soil

830
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,040
in the spring when the soil is at Field

831
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:53,440
capacity so that means that it needs to

832
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:55,599
have enough soil moisture to be um

833
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,920
tillable but it can't be

834
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,000
saturated and that is a that was a

835
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,440
difficult thing this spring um we had

836
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,119
such a dry April it was difficult to get

837
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,079
uh any kind of fi capacity in most soils

838
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,880
so and then it started raining like

839
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:14,720
crazy so it makes it it hard the soil

840
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,680
Health test should ideally be done

841
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,959
before tillage

842
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:20,639
occurs um and sometimes that's not an

843
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,000
issue in a perennial crop because we

844
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:26,679
don't do a lot of tillage but uh you do

845
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,239
want to be aware of that also you want

846
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:30,879
to have these soil Health test um

847
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:34,039
samples gathered

848
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,599
before uh the end of June because the

849
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:40,519
lab stops analyzing um the samples

850
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:44,240
sometime in July so try to make the end

851
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:45,719
of June uh being your kind of cut off

852
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,159
date if

853
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:50,559
possible you want to use a troll or a

854
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,838
spay to sample soil as a larger volume

855
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:55,920
of soil is required for this test again

856
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:58,119
I use kind of a tree spade um so that's

857
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,599
uh allows me to gather kind of a nice

858
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:04,160
sample on that you're going to be making

859
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,599
five stops across the field and you're

860
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:11,639
going to be again zigzagging kind of in

861
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:14,640
that uh W type of um random pattern you

862
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:16,358
want to collect two sub samples samples

863
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:18,598
at each stop and you're going to mix

864
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:21,519
those subsamples thoroughly and then put

865
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,480
that into the bucket at each of those

866
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:27,039
stops you want to make um two

867
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:30,599
penetrometer readings one um from 0 to 6

868
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:33,599
in and then 6 to 18in depths at each

869
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:37,079
subsample location and actually if we go

870
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,359
back to that form right down here is

871
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:42,039
this um area where you're going to have

872
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:45,159
push one and push two for the surface

873
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:46,679
and then the sub soil samples and um

874
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:49,480
you're going to be doing that for each

875
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:53,519
of those two locations so you end up

876
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:55,559
with quite a few readings there

877
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,679
um then you're going to record that on

878
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:00,679
the F uh form after you've done this

879
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:03,519
you'll have at least one and a half or

880
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:05,118
six full cups and then that's what the

881
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:07,639
three cup measurement is you want to

882
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,640
take that make sure that you have enough

883
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:13,838
mix that soil into a Ziploc bag label it

884
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:17,159
with the field name the ID and the date

885
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:19,639
on that Ziploc bag now next you want to

886
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:22,440
make sure to keep that sample out of

887
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:25,159
direct sunlight um putting it

888
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,240
immediately into a cooler and then if

889
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:30,159
you cannot get this shipped um right

890
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,799
away you want to put it in a cold room

891
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,838
or a refrigerator the entire time that

892
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,079
you're shipping so I will bring a cal

893
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:41,679
pack in my cooler put that soil sample

894
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,039
in there and um not let it warm up the

895
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:46,480
reason being that you don't want any

896
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:50,519
degradation of organic matter um to

897
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,400
happen so just be aware of that it also

898
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:54,759
makes shipping somewhat difficult

899
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,880
because this is a rather large sample

900
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,760
it's quite heavy and it still needs to

901
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,000
be cool cool during shipping so you're

902
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,440
going to have to be aware that you'll

903
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,400
need some kind of a styrofoam container

904
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,639
probably put a coal pack in if possible

905
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,400
so that the sample can remain cold

906
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:14,559
during shipping and let your grower

907
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,639
clients also know that um you you're

908
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:17,679
going to need to have some you know

909
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:19,639
they're going to need to pay for the

910
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:20,799
shipping it's it it is something to

911
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,960
consider especially if you're doing

912
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,839
multiple

913
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:29,559
samplings so interpreted interpreting

914
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:31,039
soil Health test results um make sure to

915
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:32,720
understand and this is something that I

916
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,279
it took me a while to understand that

917
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:39,199
the report is a management guide there

918
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,960
is no real hard and fast prescription

919
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:44,598
but what it does give you um are those

920
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,159
kind of readable data so that you can

921
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:49,599
try to um figure out your management

922
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:51,519
around the data different management

923
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,559
approaches can be used to mitigate the

924
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,559
same

925
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,599
problem um so that that's something that

926
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:00,559
you and the grower would disc discuss

927
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,200
quite a lot uh it while you try to

928
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:06,119
understand what's the easiest and most

929
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:08,919
um efficient and also um economical

930
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:11,200
approach for the grower in addressing

931
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,760
some of the soil constraints management

932
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,558
practices can affect multiple indicators

933
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,440
so some of your things that you might do

934
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:21,480
like using cover crops might actually

935
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:26,358
mitigate many different things and soil

936
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:28,358
Health changes slowly over time um one

937
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:30,558
thing though to be aware of is that we

938
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:35,078
use this in a vegetable

939
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:38,200
situation uh we actually were looking at

940
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:40,720
um uh things back to back and we

941
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:45,318
actually did see some improvement even

942
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:48,000
in one year so it is a long-term process

943
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:49,719
oftentimes they won't see changes but

944
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,480
it's wonderful that we now we have a

945
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:57,919
tool that we can kind of track these

946
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,920
changes when they happen um

947
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:04,159
so here is some here's an example of two

948
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:07,759
soil Health tests this is what they look

949
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:09,960
like uh we get this kind of uh we can

950
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,800
learn the effects of long-term mold

951
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,639
board plowing and that's what we're

952
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:19,000
looking at here 14 years of fall

953
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:22,960
plowing this is a corn for grain um

954
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,960
study and a clay LOM LOM soil the soil

955
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,838
physical properties have been affected

956
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,960
as have the biological properties a

957
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,639
steady diet of corn Stover has

958
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,519
maintained soil organic matter but it's

959
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:38,480
impaired active carbon levels in the no

960
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,039
till this field started out as an alala

961
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,559
hay and we see that no tilling

962
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:44,800
maintained a healthy soil which gives it

963
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,400
the high score while the continuous till

964
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,800
tillage had measurable effects and

965
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,358
results in the low score and um let me

966
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,119
just see if I can get my so you can see

967
00:44:53,358 --> 00:45:01,598
that this um test on the on the left

968
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,838
left is the corn this is the um we get

969
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,960
aggregate stability which is in a danger

970
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:09,599
thing that's the red indicates of danger

971
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:13,358
available water capaity is also in that

972
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,640
red danger zone um surface hardness it

973
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,078
has a very excellent rating probably

974
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:19,558
because of all the tillage that's

975
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:22,599
happening but the subsurface hardness

976
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:25,880
still you have a a subsurface pan deep

977
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:28,920
compaction resulting organic matter the

978
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:31,358
yellow indicates kind of a warning sign

979
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,119
um it's at 3.9 which uh is the

980
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:36,000
percentage it still seems like it should

981
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:40,480
be good but for some reason it does not

982
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,800
rate that high active carbon uh is is

983
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,318
very um poor there's soil biological

984
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,519
activity is low and potentially

985
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:51,318
mineralizable nitrogen is also in that

986
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:54,358
area but the Ral Health rating is still

987
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:56,079
quite good um so sometimes some of these

988
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:59,078
things you wonder what there there

989
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:04,160
doesn't seem to be clear um picture

990
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:08,160
across the board in one um biological

991
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:11,719
area soil pH is a little bit you know

992
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:14,039
from a nutrient or a chemical aspect 6.1

993
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:18,159
isn't bad but they put it in the yellow

994
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:21,719
range extractable phosphorus um is a

995
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:25,679
little bit uh High probably so that puts

996
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:27,799
that into a a yellow area a caution

997
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,000
extractable potassium is fine and all

998
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,119
your minor elements are fine but that

999
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,239
that rating gives it a low reading

1000
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,079
whereas on the right the same kind of

1001
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:39,719
situation but they've done no till you

1002
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,359
can see that all of the aggregate

1003
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:45,919
stability the subsurface hardness

1004
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:47,759
um the organic matter and the

1005
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,000
potentially mineralizable nitrogen

1006
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,119
things that were in the red areas um now

1007
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,199
are green giving it a much higher uh

1008
00:46:54,119 --> 00:47:00,880
rating so the soil Health then is deemed

1009
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:02,960
better and we aren't as lucky we a lot

1010
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,400
of times we have a no till situation

1011
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,920
just because Berry crops are primarily

1012
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,920
no till so approach for a successful

1013
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,400
soil management strategy you want to

1014
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,680
assess your soil's health to identify

1015
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,559
constraints and that's what we're

1016
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:18,558
recommending doing with the Cornell soil

1017
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,440
Health test you want to be able to make

1018
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,960
changes in management strategies that

1019
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,079
work for your farm and that address the

1020
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,639
specific constraints identified in the

1021
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:29,480
soil Health test you want to be able to

1022
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:32,358
experiment on your farm to see what

1023
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:36,679
works in your situation starting small

1024
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:39,480
is helpful and um you should be able to

1025
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:41,519
adapt the many resources of information

1026
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:44,880
that you gan from the soil Health test

1027
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:47,318
to your farm and build healthy soils to

1028
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,960
increase resiliency to extremes and

1029
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:53,800
that's one of the overall um

1030
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,639
goals and now um Kathy's going to talk

1031
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,519
about uh the cornal tissue analysis or

1032
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,598
the or excuse me just tissue anal

1033
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:03,079
analysis in

1034
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:06,519
general thanks

1035
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:10,680
Laura we want to take a look now at the

1036
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:12,000
above ground aspect of uh small fruit

1037
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:16,399
production and we're going to look at

1038
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,239
tissue analysis or Leaf analysis and

1039
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,639
this kind of testing directly measures

1040
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:23,519
the amount of nutrients in the leaves

1041
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:25,440
and in some instances as incredible as

1042
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,679
it may seem there may be sufficient

1043
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,280
nutrients in soil and yet leaves can

1044
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:34,358
show a deficiency and we'll talk about

1045
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:37,079
the reasons why that may happen so these

1046
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:40,679
sufficiency ranges uh have been

1047
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:42,800
determined or estimated for small fruits

1048
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:45,199
um sometimes from other crops sometimes

1049
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:50,000
directly and so we'll be looking at

1050
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:54,480
those shortly um and these ranges when

1051
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:58,838
you fall into the lower or deficient uh

1052
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:01,559
levels alert you to nut ENT uh issues

1053
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:03,719
that are are approaching are coming and

1054
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:05,839
often those can be caught before they

1055
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:07,358
become critical and effect yield and

1056
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:10,639
plant

1057
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:12,838
performance um these tests are also used

1058
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:16,318
to fine-tune annual nitrogen application

1059
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:19,639
rates typically there's a suggested

1060
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,639
application based on the crop age but

1061
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:24,879
you may need to adjust in your

1062
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:27,960
particular situation uh either higher or

1063
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,200
lower depending on the test results and

1064
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,559
then these can also be used

1065
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:34,199
diagnostically as Jeff discussed earlier

1066
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:36,519
to rule out nutritional causes for poor

1067
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:36,519
Plant

1068
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,318
performance oop sorry wrong

1069
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:52,680
way so these tests can also be done at

1070
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:55,679
the Agro one uh lab and the information

1071
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:57,879
for the lab is here um these tests

1072
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:00,118
previously were done at Cornell at the

1073
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:03,280
nutrient analysis lab and they've been

1074
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:05,240
shifted to aggro one so that uh the

1075
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,559
nutrient analysis lab can continue to do

1076
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:10,159
the research needed to to uh fine-tune

1077
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,920
the recommendations and in this instance

1078
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,798
you're looking for uh the tree fruit in

1079
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:18,440
small fruit form form

1080
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:21,679
p and the report that you will get will

1081
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:24,119
give you uh the Cornell nutrient

1082
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:27,118
guidelines uh inter and the

1083
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:28,640
interpretation thereof and the same run

1084
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,640
roughly uh

1085
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:31,639
$24

1086
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,760
each so when would you need to collect

1087
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:41,358
leaves for the analysis typically

1088
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,119
strawberry leaves are

1089
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:46,078
collected uh after renovation and we're

1090
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:48,960
looking for the first

1091
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,318
regrowth the youngest full-sized leaves

1092
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,960
and those are usually collected uh

1093
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:57,318
toward the middle to the end of July for

1094
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:00,079
blueberries these leaves are collected

1095
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:01,440
just before or during Harvest and you're

1096
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,519
sampling

1097
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,838
from uh fully expanded mature leaves

1098
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,880
from the middle of this year's Chute

1099
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:10,239
growth and those that are exposed to

1100
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,838
full sun typically these are collected

1101
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:15,000
in Late July and early August for

1102
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:17,159
raspberries and blackberries you're

1103
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,920
collecting leaves from the Prima canes

1104
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:21,199
and you're looking for the youngest

1105
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,680
fully expanded leaves typically they're

1106
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:24,719
collected in early

1107
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:27,159
August one of the things that you want

1108
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:29,759
to remember though is that it's best to

1109
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:31,480
avoid collecting leaves when the plant

1110
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,280
resources are all being directed fully

1111
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:37,039
to fruit because in a lot of instances

1112
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:40,119
those levels can fluctuate there may be

1113
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:42,358
sufficient uh nutrients in the soil for

1114
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:44,880
example um but the leaves may show a

1115
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:46,078
deficiency this is particularly true of

1116
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,160
um

1117
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,680
potassium so you want to be sure to try

1118
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:53,039
to collect

1119
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:54,838
um when their plants aren't under a

1120
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,960
heavy fruit load that's not always

1121
00:51:54,838 --> 00:52:00,159
possible but try to avoid that whenever

1122
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,159
you

1123
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,838
can so how do we collect the

1124
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,239
leaves again we want healthy leaves that

1125
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:10,279
are well exposed to light they should be

1126
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:12,959
representative for the average condition

1127
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,720
of the planting uh try not to select

1128
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,079
leaves that are damaged by disease

1129
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,239
insects WEA for example hail damaged or

1130
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:21,000
mechanical

1131
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:23,159
injury um don't mix leaves from

1132
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,599
different calars remember Jeff talked

1133
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:27,879
about Management areas you want to try

1134
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,440
to keep your man Management areas

1135
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:33,039
uniform um plantings of different ages

1136
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,200
leaves from those should not be mixed

1137
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:38,960
those should be sep separately sampled

1138
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:41,960
and you want a minimum of uh 2 ounces of

1139
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,838
fresh weight leaves typically 30 leaves

1140
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,440
for each sample if possible try to

1141
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:48,798
collect each Leaf from a different plant

1142
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,720
within the sample area and then try to

1143
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:53,039
process your leaves for analysis as soon

1144
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:53,039
as

1145
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,519
possible okay when you prepare your

1146
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,400
leaves for

1147
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:02,039
analysis um one of the things you want

1148
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,480
to do is use distilled water for washing

1149
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:06,159
and rinsing the samples washing leaves

1150
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,280
removes dirt and residues that can

1151
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:10,039
affect the test results so it's

1152
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,720
important to do so before they're dried

1153
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:13,039
for

1154
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:14,919
shipment so gently and lightly scrub the

1155
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,960
leaves together in distilled water

1156
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,760
change the water if it becomes dirty or

1157
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:22,318
after 8 to 10 samples whichever occurs

1158
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,520
first shake the leaves gently to remove

1159
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:28,119
excess water and then rinse the sample

1160
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:31,960
in clean distilled water water again

1161
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:34,720
shake off the uh liquid and rinse with

1162
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:38,318
another clean uh water

1163
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:40,199
sample you can lay these out on paper

1164
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:42,318
towels and let them dry slightly before

1165
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:44,239
you put them in a paper bag and then you

1166
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:45,719
want to leave the top of that bag open

1167
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,078
and dry the leaves at room temperature

1168
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:49,919
until they're brittle it's important not

1169
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,798
to let the leaves stand in water you

1170
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,440
want to try to wash and rinse them in a

1171
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:55,838
minute or less if

1172
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,559
possible don't put them in plastic bags

1173
00:53:55,838 --> 00:54:00,679
to ship them or ship fresh leaves

1174
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:02,519
without drying because these they often

1175
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:04,078
can deteriorate really rapidly under

1176
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:06,920
those conditions and it'll result in

1177
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,920
very poor test

1178
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,559
results so here's the chart that I was

1179
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:15,879
telling you about where we have the

1180
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,880
standard folar nutrient

1181
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:22,440
ranges and I want you to notice that

1182
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:25,358
when you look for example at

1183
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,798
strawberries you have a range where the

1184
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:30,199
nutrients are suff deficient and then a

1185
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:32,280
range where they are deficient below a

1186
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:35,000
particular point and you'll notice

1187
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,798
across the top the nitrogen is expressed

1188
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,199
in percentages that's true all the way

1189
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:42,798
down to Boron and then the P the uh

1190
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:45,598
ranges are expressed in parts per

1191
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:50,079
million or PPM and so when we look at

1192
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:51,640
strawberries you'll see that the ranges

1193
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,400
if you compare those to raspberries

1194
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:56,039
you'll see that for the most part the

1195
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,200
ranges are are pretty much the same for

1196
00:54:56,039 --> 00:55:01,199
these two crops you see there's not a

1197
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:05,118
lot of difference between um for example

1198
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:07,039
Zinc at uh 20 to 50 PPM and the same for

1199
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:10,920
raspberries in the sufficient range 20

1200
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:13,318
to 50 PPM but when we

1201
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,880
compare say for example strawberries or

1202
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:17,318
raspberries with blueberries you will

1203
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,680
see that blueberries have significantly

1204
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:19,679
lower

1205
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:25,760
levels the critical values for

1206
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:27,520
blueberries are quite a bit lower they

1207
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,720
have muchow lower nutrient requirements

1208
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:32,199
than strawberries and raspberries one

1209
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:34,439
exception to this however is

1210
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:36,318
manganese higher manganese levels with

1211
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,798
blueberries is not a problem as it might

1212
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:41,199
be with other crops because manganese

1213
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:43,199
becomes less available as the pH drops

1214
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:47,038
so you can see here blueberries are able

1215
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:50,000
to tolerate manganese even at the 350

1216
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:56,119
PPM range whereas uh strawberries and

1217
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,119
rasberries prefer a range of 200 or less

1218
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:01,318
okay it's important to note that not all

1219
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:03,280
Labs will compensate for the differences

1220
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:05,880
between say for example strawberries and

1221
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,599
raspberries and blueberries in terms of

1222
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,720
the blueberries having lower nutrient

1223
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,838
requirements and they will often use the

1224
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:14,399
same recommendations that they are using

1225
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:16,038
for strawberries and raspberries with

1226
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,160
blueberries because these

1227
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:21,480
recommendations are common across a wide

1228
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:23,558
range of crops and so they may be

1229
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,920
recommending addition of nutrients in

1230
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:26,760
blueberries where really they aren't

1231
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:29,760
necessary and so that's of the things

1232
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,760
you really need to watch

1233
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:38,838
for okay here's a typical uh plant

1234
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:42,838
tissue analysis report uh from Farmer in

1235
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:44,880
the Dell at HiHo Dario Road um these are

1236
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:47,759
blueberries they're 1 to 3 years old

1237
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,519
they're non-bearing and the variety is

1238
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,960
liberty and you can see here there's a

1239
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:54,559
knif nice graphic that gives you the

1240
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,798
macro and micro

1241
00:56:54,559 --> 00:57:00,519
nutrients EX the bar graph shows when

1242
00:56:57,798 --> 00:57:02,239
they're in range or when they're low

1243
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:05,000
typically you get the most benefit when

1244
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:08,000
you address um nutrient issues that are

1245
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,798
falling in the low to deficient range

1246
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,480
that's when you really need to uh make

1247
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:16,519
corrective action when they're in range

1248
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:20,358
or in the high range that's when

1249
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:23,719
typically um you won't get a lot of

1250
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:28,038
um Change in Plant performance if you

1251
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:28,038
make those uh Corrections

1252
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:33,880
and so when we look at this report we

1253
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:37,960
can see that both copper and iron are

1254
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:40,440
deficient zinc is also low however if we

1255
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,119
look at the soil levels over here the

1256
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,480
levels for those nutrients are adquate

1257
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:48,400
so what would the problem be here if we

1258
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:50,358
go back and look at the soil test

1259
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,318
results which is why you want to really

1260
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:56,400
have a paired sample you'll notice that

1261
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:57,480
the pH here is 5.2 which is uh higher

1262
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,599
than you really would like for a

1263
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:02,199
blueberry planting for blueberries you

1264
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:05,119
really would prefer 4.2 to

1265
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:07,038
4.5 when the pH reaches that level the

1266
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,240
available nutrients in the soil will

1267
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:11,559
become available and those

1268
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:14,919
deficiencies should correct themselves

1269
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:14,920
without even having to make an

1270
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,599
application so when you're interpreting

1271
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,679
your results be sure that the soil pH is

1272
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:28,318
within the correct range

1273
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:29,919
assess the status of the planting to

1274
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:32,038
determine if some something other than

1275
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:34,760
nutrients could be limiting growth for

1276
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:37,240
example disease insect pressure drought

1277
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,319
other environmental conditions be sure

1278
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:41,078
to check the status of boron because

1279
00:58:39,318 --> 00:58:43,358
that has an effect on other

1280
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:46,160
nutrients look for specific nutrients

1281
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:48,679
that may be deficient check for inter

1282
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:52,078
interactions or imbalances that EXA

1283
00:58:48,679 --> 00:58:53,598
exacerbate low nutrient levels and then

1284
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,680
um come up with your

1285
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:58,000
recommendations when Boron levels are

1286
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:59,519
low that affects root growth root growth

1287
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,599
and development limiting the uptake of

1288
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:04,119
other nutrients such as calcium and

1289
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,359
potassium soil levels of these nutrients

1290
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:08,358
may be adequate while Leaf levels appear

1291
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:10,279
deficient when you correct the Boron

1292
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:12,119
levels it will often correct the issues

1293
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,480
with the other nutrients without the

1294
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:16,079
need for addition of supplemental

1295
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,119
calcium or

1296
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:20,960
potassium another thing to note as we

1297
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:23,559
discussed earlier is that fruiting takes

1298
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,400
a lot of potassium so a levels of this

1299
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:28,160
nutrient may be adequate while Leaf

1300
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:31,480
levels appear low this is especially

1301
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:33,639
true as Leaf sampling often occurs not

1302
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,920
long after Fring allowing time for

1303
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:39,000
uptake and adequate irrigation will rep

1304
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,280
replenish Leaf levels of potassium

1305
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,199
without the need of

1306
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,599
supplementing sometimes high levels of

1307
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:48,439
soil nutrients may also cause problems

1308
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:50,440
for example if phosphorus is too high it

1309
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,920
may restrict uptake of micronutrients

1310
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:55,599
such as zinc copper or

1311
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:57,838
iron or magnesium by tying them up in

1312
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:00,599
the soil this frequently occurs in the

1313
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:02,078
case of strawberries another interaction

1314
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:04,640
involves high calcium levels in

1315
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:09,240
blueberry soils this nutrient often ties

1316
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:09,239
up iron in the soil causing a folar

1317
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:15,519
deficiency so when you're interpreting

1318
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:18,480
uh tissue analysis test results there

1319
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:21,480
are some things to to remember first of

1320
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,639
all um the test results are not

1321
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:26,240
meaningful for fertility fertility

1322
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:27,279
guidelines unless the soil pH is within

1323
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,719
the correct

1324
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,359
range and remember that soil test

1325
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:33,159
results do not always correlate with

1326
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:35,078
folar test results for a variety of

1327
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:37,038
reasons so you may have adequate

1328
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:38,920
nutrition in the soil while there

1329
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:41,039
appears not to be adequate nutrition in

1330
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:43,000
the leaves or the reverse may also be

1331
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:45,839
true you may appear to have adequate

1332
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,358
nutrition in leaves but not in

1333
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:51,000
soil tissue analysis tests are useful

1334
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:52,960
for diagnosis but not for detailed

1335
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,719
guidance unless you consider all of the

1336
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,599
factors involved including growth and

1337
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:58,439
yield

1338
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:00,559
and applying nutrients may result in a

1339
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,519
decrease in folar concentration under

1340
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:04,720
certain

1341
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:07,199
circumstances correcting deficiencies or

1342
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:09,879
imbalances in established plantings is

1343
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:12,519
more difficult than amending soils prior

1344
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,798
to planting so really that pre-plant

1345
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:17,358
soil test and soil amendment prior to

1346
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:21,119
planting is critical and often provides

1347
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:25,679
enough nutrients especially P&amp;K and the

1348
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,680
micros for the life of the planting

1349
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,519
nitrogen is something that we need to

1350
01:01:28,838 --> 01:01:33,480
add annually and I mentioned that it's

1351
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:36,239
often determined by the crop the plant

1352
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:39,760
age the irrigation and mulching status

1353
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:42,558
and the leaf analysis results so often

1354
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:46,839
Growers will say okay my strawberry crop

1355
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:50,559
is 2 years old and so I'm applying um 25

1356
01:01:46,838 --> 01:01:53,920
pounds per acre of actual nitrogen and

1357
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:56,920
if you actually used your Leaf analysis

1358
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:59,358
results in comparison

1359
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,119
to the crop age you might find that you

1360
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,880
had sufficient nitrogen and you might be

1361
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:05,760
able to apply less or you might find

1362
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,798
that your nitrogen is actually lacking

1363
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,200
in leaves and you might need to apply

1364
01:02:07,798 --> 01:02:12,400
more and for more information on this

1365
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:14,719
topic you should check the Corell Pest

1366
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,079
Management guidelines for Berry crops to

1367
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:19,558
find the annual rates of nitrogen for

1368
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:21,599
your crop or the NRA production guides

1369
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:22,798
for more in-depth information on

1370
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:27,720
adjusting

1371
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:27,719
these to get the proper results

1372
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:35,359
so again in many cases no additional

1373
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,079
pkmg or CA will be required if the soil

1374
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:40,239
test recommendations were followed at

1375
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:44,318
planting you may need to supplement uh K

1376
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:45,919
and um potassium and Boron especially on

1377
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:48,599
sandier soils because those have a

1378
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:50,318
tendency to leech more quickly and small

1379
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:52,278
amounts of sulfur may be required to

1380
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:54,639
maintain a low PH in some soils where

1381
01:02:52,278 --> 01:02:58,278
blueberries are grown especially if

1382
01:02:54,639 --> 01:03:01,920
calcium levels are approaching

1383
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:03,639
2,000 Leaf analyses provides uh guidance

1384
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,880
on supplemental fertilizers after the

1385
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:08,960
planning established and don't rely on a

1386
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,160
soil test for postplant

1387
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,480
recommendations that do not involve soil

1388
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:16,838
PH remember the pH has to be at the

1389
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,838
correct

1390
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:23,119
range so in review don't rely on visual

1391
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:24,959
symptoms of what you've always done in

1392
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:27,200
the past in terms of berry soil nutrient

1393
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,199
management if you want to maximize your

1394
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:31,879
yield and plant Health before you plant

1395
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:35,480
consider doing the Cornell soil Health

1396
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:37,720
test which includes the standard um

1397
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:39,519
chemical soil test and more the physical

1398
01:03:37,719 --> 01:03:41,919
and biological properties that Laura

1399
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:45,639
discussed and then after plants are

1400
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:48,079
established use annual tissue analysis

1401
01:03:45,639 --> 01:03:52,078
and soil testing every 2 to three years

1402
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:52,079
to fine-tune your nutrient

1403
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,720
plan that's the end of our presentation
