1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,120
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,120
university

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,359
i just wanted to start out right away by

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,199
thanking my lab group and the funding

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,239
source for the

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,358
information i'm going to be sharing with

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,559
you today

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,720
so

9
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,358
right now in my lab i have ruth gender

10
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,118
who runs a program for organic farmers

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,960
out of my group

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,480
very independently

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,719
but she lets me be a part of it too

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,280
sometimes and then my students jenna

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,679
lynn eric anna christina

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,920
iselle and christina who

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,759
um four of them are working on bacterial

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,439
related projects and then anna christina

19
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,439
is our vibrologist right now

20
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,200
and then um

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,878
i also wanted to thank uh well really

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,480
all the staff but particularly andy

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,079
whether albert webber fred hathner and

24
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,759
keith heinz and who are in our seed

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,600
potato program because

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,119
they also help a lot when we want

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,039
samples collected in a certain way they

28
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,198
help us rate field plots and things like

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,198
that

30
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,560
so i wanted to start out talking

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,799
actually about the seed program and then

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,478
to introduce the pathogen it's that

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,960
group that i'm going to be describing

34
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,000
today and to show you

35
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,239
how

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,759
why we're interested in it

37
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,118
is this

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,159
it is not okay

39
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,560
so i

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,000
i'm located in madison

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,118
most of our commercial potatoes are

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,640
grown in the central sands right here

43
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,640
and then our seed growers are up in

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,079
anago here and then the university farm

45
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,920
is on the rhinelander there's a highway

46
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,438
that just runs straight up and down so i

47
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,600
spent a lot of my time driving up and

48
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,438
down that road

49
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,879
and things basically

50
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,599
like everything they run downhill i

51
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,438
guess so the potato seed potatoes grown

52
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,919
in ryland are sold to anago those are

53
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:50,239
generally sold everywhere south

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,159
and the other key thing that's going on

55
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,399
in wisconsin is the potato germplasm

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,560
center is here at sturgeon bay so

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,640
the u.s collection of diverse potato

58
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,879
genotypes is easily accessible right

59
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,879
there

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,359
and then this is the farm

61
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,199
it's about a thousand acres so it's

62
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,520
actually larger than the madison campus

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,959
it's mostly woods and a couple of lakes

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,040
we have four greenhouses about 100 acres

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,560
90 acres of potatoes every year and it's

66
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,000
a three year rotation and we tend to

67
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,000
irrigate out of this lake here

68
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,878
and it's a really beautiful place to

69
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,919
visit there's a lot of wildlife um i've

70
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,878
been followed by wolves we see bears

71
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,318
um

72
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,399
and so i stole all those pictures from

73
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,919
national geographic and they didn't have

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,959
the really important wildlife that we

75
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,399
have

76
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,719
up at the farm they didn't have any

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,800
photos of these guys but when i first

78
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,159
started i was interested

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,599
i was trained as a bacteriologist in

80
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,120
alan's lab so i wanted to work on

81
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,000
bacteria because that's what i knew how

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,239
to do

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,919
and i knew we had pectobacterium or soft

84
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,439
rot arminia in the lake and we were

85
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,598
irrigating with it it seemed like that

86
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,039
could be a problem

87
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,518
and then sending these potatoes all over

88
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,519
the country

89
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,039
okay so

90
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,719
how are they produced and was there

91
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,519
actually a problem when you irrigate

92
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,598
with water containing a plant pathogen

93
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,920
so everything comes up to that farm in

94
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,359
tissue culture um

95
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,799
we send tens of thousands of these

96
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,280
little plants up there every year from

97
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,040
the lab these should be pathogen-free

98
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,719
they get put into a hydroponic system

99
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,239
and we grow about three to four hundred

100
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,800
thousand mini tubers this way every year

101
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,120
these little guys are planted in a field

102
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,879
and what we harvest from them is sold to

103
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,319
the farmers to support the program or we

104
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,598
replant it and sell the second

105
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:32,878
generation

106
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,039
and if all goes well then they have

107
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,280
warehouses full of seed potatoes and

108
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,519
actually in the seed system soft drops

109
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,719
not that big of a deal and i think it's

110
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,200
because

111
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,639
they don't stress the plants for size

112
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,479
and they store them at a cooler

113
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,158
temperature so we see it but we don't

114
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,919
see it as a big deal

115
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,679
in commercial farming though it is a big

116
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,000
problem and it tends to either be a

117
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,080
problem right as they're emerging if we

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,360
have violent storms which happen a lot

119
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,799
in busan

120
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,319
or at this stage when the whole

121
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,319
warehouse will just rot

122
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,359
so

123
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,799
so it is a significant issue but not

124
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,680
generally with the growers i work with

125
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,519
we also certify

126
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,959
all the seed potatoes grown in a

127
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,399
regulatory program and it works out to

128
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,600
about seven and a half percent of the

129
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,399
total potatoes produced in the u.s

130
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,639
and

131
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,239
i wanted to

132
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,600
show you a little bit of this so i

133
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,439
realized just a few years ago with an

134
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,360
amazing we never throw anything away so

135
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,199
we have this amazing data set that goes

136
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,280
back decades

137
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,600
plus we have a lot of information on

138
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,039
what it actually costs to produce a crop

139
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,560
of potatoes and what the diseases

140
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,000
actually cost because we've been keeping

141
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,600
these budgets for years and we're

142
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,160
throwing them away

143
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,160
so we started publishing that

144
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,120
and again i can go back to these reports

145
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,880
and see

146
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,560
whether software is a big deal or not

147
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,120
and on occasion it shows up it's not

148
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,720
really the biggest thing we worry about

149
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,639
we got some kind of fun graphs out of

150
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,880
this so for example we can track

151
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,840
reduction in disease over the past 60

152
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,360
years

153
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,439
and reduction in human error over the

154
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,319
past 60 years in farming

155
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,560
so disease goes down with a

156
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,800
half-life of about 10 years and farming

157
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,439
the half-life is about the same as a

158
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,720
generation of farmers right so

159
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,719
it's about 26 years

160
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,680
and from this

161
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,120
data set that we from our certification

162
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,959
data it's just the form that they have

163
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,038
to fill out for receipt live

164
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,038
we can tell that pby right now is the

165
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,519
number one reason it's a potato virus y

166
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,120
is the number one reason for

167
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,319
seed certification

168
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,160
rejections and that's the basis for why

169
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,079
i'm really here today because this

170
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,919
project was stuart and

171
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,560
why i might becoming a me becoming a

172
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,478
virologist um

173
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,000
this really struck me until we put this

174
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,359
graph together ahead and realized this

175
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,519
that the other main reason for

176
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,840
rejections are mistakes that the farmers

177
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,839
make

178
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,680
and it's actually a bigger

179
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,519
issue than disease and really some of

180
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,918
these pby projections are probably due

181
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,758
to farmers making mistakes too

182
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,478
so i have become

183
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,080
i understand more now why maybe social

184
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,359
sciences need to be a part of what we do

185
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,439
because we should be thinking about how

186
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,000
farmers make decisions when we also try

187
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:17,399
to control disease or get them to adopt

188
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,399
control methods

189
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,679
the other place where we see a lot of

190
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,079
things coming out of the field besides

191
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,600
seed production is again ruth ginger's

192
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,839
program in organic

193
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,639
potato production so she works with now

194
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,599
38 farmers between ohio and north dakota

195
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,918
and we run variety trialing and it's

196
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,199
it's all very applied so what varieties

197
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,439
would work best for them how can we get

198
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,280
them seed how should they be controlling

199
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,038
disease how do you grow potatoes without

200
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,519
irrigation that kind of thing and we get

201
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,000
a lot of disease incidence data

202
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,279
soft rod so what this table shows all

203
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,879
these tiny little numbers it's a whole

204
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,918
bunch of varieties

205
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,560
and then it's

206
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,000
what percent of the lots from 2013 did

207
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,560
we have

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,360
a lot of calls off that field due to

209
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,120
certain disease so for example

210
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,120
adirondack blue silver skirt was our

211
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,959
main problem in most of our lots from

212
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,079
the farms we got data from

213
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,839
so soft dry is never a big deal but it's

214
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,879
constantly there so at harvest it's not

215
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,879
a big deal but when you're trying to

216
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,879
store things it can become a big deal

217
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,478
okay

218
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,240
so the pepto-bacteria bacterial soft

219
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,279
grout what is this it's

220
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,079
they're

221
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,198
ground negative bacteria they're the

222
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,359
enterobacteriaceae family so that's the

223
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,280
same as e coli and salmonella so you can

224
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,360
think of them

225
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,198
sort of like a plant pathogenic e coli

226
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
they're really easy to work with and a

227
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,960
lot of the tools that work with e coli

228
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,000
will also work with pectobacterium we

229
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,399
used to call it a winnie on carrot

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,240
topper or the softer automatic

231
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,399
so this family has a lot of human and

232
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,079
plant pathogens they often have insect

233
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,679
vectors they're really common in the

234
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,120
environment they're easy to

235
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,959
the family tends to be very easy to get

236
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,680
out of water and soil for example in all

237
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,399
the plants and up with people and cows

238
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,000
they have simple circular five megabase

239
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,000
genomes and they sometimes have

240
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,598
plastidines the the soft draw bacteria

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,959
that we work with plasmids don't seem to

242
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,959
be an important part of the story they

243
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,359
just have this five megabase circle

244
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,439
through their genome

245
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,038
and we've been grouping them

246
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,360
what we call the pdd clades so it's

247
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:20,240
pecto bacteria dichia and bernaria so

248
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,680
these three generals seem to fall form a

249
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,160
group of plant pathogens and

250
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,639
enterobacter you see it um

251
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,280
hectobacteria and nadipia are broad host

252
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,840
range soft drop pathogens so they cause

253
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,120
decay and wilt type diseases

254
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,000
and in

255
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,278
a whole

256
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,479
you know whole bunch of different

257
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,479
species of dicots and monocots

258
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,200
and then bernaria has been

259
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,839
almost unstudied so we think of it it

260
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,278
infects things like willow trees

261
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,959
and uh

262
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,000
walnut trees and then recently

263
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,199
cantaloupe has been about to be a host

264
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,958
and we don't tend to think of it as

265
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,640
peptolytic or causing soft drop but we

266
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,359
really don't know very much about this

267
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,360
genus at all

268
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,639
okay so this is a typical

269
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:07,039
example of a potato that has soft rod

270
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,879
from the field and you can see this

271
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,079
spot right here that's

272
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,000
would have been what was connected to

273
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,600
the stolen or the stem that connects the

274
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,039
tuber to the plant and that seems to be

275
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,159
where the bacteria

276
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,439
we often see

277
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,719
evidence that they've gone in through

278
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,720
the stolen and into the tuber

279
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,560
and i also just want you to think about

280
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,559
this is a really nice anaerobic chamber

281
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,159
right so they've gone in they can't

282
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,000
digest the skin

283
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,439
right there so they've got their own

284
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,639
little protective food source of the

285
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,560
soil that they're not sharing with

286
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,399
anybody

287
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,799
so you get very high concentrations of

288
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,320
bacteria here

289
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,838
okay

290
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,480
so i wanted to emphasize that these are

291
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,920
broad ostrage necrotropes and so i'm

292
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,039
guessing there's a lot of people here in

293
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,958
this audience and a lot about

294
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,278
pseudomonas syringes so

295
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,359
please don't try to make this fit this

296
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,360
is a stringy model um

297
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,919
we get this a lot when we try to submit

298
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,759
papers um

299
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,838
so they

300
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,759
we don't have examples of gene for gene

301
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,360
resistance for example that we know of

302
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,799
the least

303
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,800
we don't have evidence that these

304
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,278
pathogens are suppressing plant defenses

305
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:14,319
in fact they seem to perhaps induce cell

306
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:17,120
death and benefit from that

307
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,720
and they do cause cell death

308
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,639
so it's very different from pseudomonas

309
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,839
ringi which there's lots of examples of

310
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,000
g for g resistance they are very active

311
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,920
in suppressing plant defenses and they

312
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,879
do cause cell death eventually but

313
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,639
that's not what happens first

314
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,919
i also wanted to point out this symptom

315
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,120
because it's one that i

316
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,479
hadn't really appreciated until i

317
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,919
started working with this the first

318
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,120
thing that these guys do is trying to

319
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,719
plant yellow

320
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,278
like that so you can see that in the

321
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,839
field as like a bright yellow spot

322
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,278
and then the plant

323
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,200
dies okay

324
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,480
so where are they in the plant

325
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,480
they seem to

326
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,720
be very good at colonizing the vascular

327
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,079
system specifically the xylem so this is

328
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,120
just a potato stem that's been

329
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,239
inoculated with gfp-labeled bacteria

330
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,399
and i'll show you in a second why we

331
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,240
think those are xylo and you can see

332
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,759
this in field samples too the xylem will

333
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,278
turn black

334
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,200
and the center part of the stem will

335
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:13,879
also turn black and then the bacteria

336
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,879
are in between the cells too so

337
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,480
that this is a stem cut

338
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,000
longitudinally and here's the bacteria

339
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,159
in the xylem

340
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,759
you can see the

341
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,759
kind of spring-like

342
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,600
structure of the xylem and what strikes

343
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,360
me with this is the high density of the

344
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,079
bacterial cells they're really packed in

345
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,600
there

346
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,519
and that they actually the structure

347
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,800
design was still intact that surprised

348
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,480
me too because i thought of a soft

349
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:42,599
pathogen it would break down the xylem

350
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,600
but it's not doing that here

351
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,039
and then this is the

352
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,719
the cells within the stem and hopefully

353
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,319
what you can see is that the bacteria

354
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,600
tend to be around the edges of the cells

355
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,879
they're not just

356
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,399
necessarily um collapsing everything

357
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,320
right away

358
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,159
they do occasionally get inside a cell

359
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,000
and you'll see them swimming around like

360
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,519
crazy in these cells so that's another

361
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
difference between cinnamon and stringy

362
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,278
and

363
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,120
which you guys are probably more

364
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,200
familiar with effective bacteria these

365
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,278
guys tend to be modal in the plant they

366
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,200
cut their flagella and they're swimming

367
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,200
it makes doing growth curves a challenge

368
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,839
because the bacteria don't stay at all

369
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,278
where you put them

370
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,600
and the other thing i wanted to point

371
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,480
out is the density inside the cell is

372
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,759
never like it gets into the xylem so you

373
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,680
can see the big difference here between

374
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,159
how much gmp is there and what's inside

375
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,159
this cell

376
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,240
all right so just a little bit about

377
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,519
what we know how these guys interact

378
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,839
with plants at a more larger level

379
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,919
when i started in madison

380
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,079
i had to switch topics and i had to work

381
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,639
with something on potato

382
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,879
and i had an empty lab and so the first

383
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,240
thing i did was run out with walter

384
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,078
stevenson and we visited a bunch of

385
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,440
fields and storages where they had soft

386
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,879
drought diseases

387
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,320
the entire time he was trying to talk me

388
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,600
to working on common scab and that just

389
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
seemed too hard

390
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,399
so

391
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
collected a bunch of strains and i was

392
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,759
just trying to get a collection to start

393
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,440
working with and the first surprise we

394
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,720
got is that

395
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,639
what we were finding out in the field

396
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,160
wasn't just pectobacter and keratovrome

397
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,759
or pectobacteria nitrocepticum which

398
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,078
were the species we'd expected to find

399
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:21,120
but we found a lot of other clades of

400
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,399
pectobacterium also causing disease

401
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,399
so these are examples of what we

402
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,480
commonly find so pectobacter and

403
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,879
cartogram heretobrum

404
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,120
are subspecies brazilians or subspecies

405
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,799
are different or pectobacterium wasabi

406
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,440
which until then we thought was a

407
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,879
pathogen of wasabi and hot potato

408
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,800
we haven't found pectoral bacteria

409
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,278
nitroceptive yet in wisconsin i think

410
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:44,159
it's because our summers are so hot

411
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,919
it doesn't survive

412
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,879
but the take-home point here is that

413
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:51,199
multiple species tend to be present in a

414
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,600
field and sometimes in a plant

415
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,680
and so what we've done then in our lab

416
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,959
group is we're trying to focus less on

417
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,519
the things that differ between the

418
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,838
species and more on what does that genus

419
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,519
have in common

420
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,040
since we're going to find

421
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,560
multiple

422
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,559
species within a field anyway

423
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,000
okay so

424
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,000
this is just a representation of a

425
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,759
phylogenetic tree and that's to remind

426
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,679
me to tell you that i work very closely

427
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,600
with a couple researchers at uw campus

428
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,759
and one of them is nicole perna who's

429
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,440
about very interested in bioinformatics

430
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,799
and in the evolution of this bacterial

431
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,279
family and alan is the one who

432
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,799
introduced us and it's been so thank you

433
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,759
um we've been working together we both

434
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,198
started with uw and about the same time

435
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,480
and so a lot of what i'm going to tell

436
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,120
you about today is from this

437
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,120
collaboration

438
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,480
so one of the things nicole did was she

439
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,000
sequenced a big chunk of our culture

440
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,639
collection

441
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,159
she had money from biofuels

442
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,000
money

443
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,399
and i'm not sure you can defend the

444
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,919
choice of sequencing soft drop bacteria

445
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,078
for biofuels research but i was happy

446
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,759
she did it and

447
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,278
all of these genome sequences went into

448
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,278
her database so this is publicly

449
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,559
available

450
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,320
and each

451
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,278
each

452
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,360
gene in each microbe has its own page

453
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,360
and you can get the sequence the protein

454
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,919
sequence the math where that g is this

455
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,919
is her belt which is a regulator for the

456
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,919
type 3 secretion system and then

457
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,719
everything we know about that gene that

458
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:24,000
people have bothered to put in so

459
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,360
motifs publications related to that gene

460
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,759
and all the other homologs within the

461
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,680
database you can quickly link to

462
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,639
so this has been really valuable for us

463
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,838
and i wanted to show you a few things

464
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,680
that we've been doing with this and this

465
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,600
this is where this 300 genome title came

466
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,078
from so we've been using doing an

467
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,959
analysis of 307 of the genomes that are

468
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,559
in here and annotated

469
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,958
so some of the things that we've been

470
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,958
able to do

471
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,639
this is my favorite project out of this

472
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,479
we had a student bang

473
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,159
who developed a supervised machine

474
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,440
learning program to tell us what genes

475
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,958
were likely to be involved in plant

476
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,800
microbe interactions so we've got a lot

477
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,159
of genes with no known function and no

478
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,679
clear way to figure out what the

479
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,759
function is

480
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,120
so she basically took all the data in

481
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,480
this database

482
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,320
and

483
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,159
use it as a training set

484
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,600
and so i at the beginning of this

485
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,039
project didn't really know how do you

486
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,959
describe what supervised machine

487
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,198
learning is

488
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,518
and the way they described it to us it's

489
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,919
uh to my lab group was it's like netflix

490
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,600
right netflix will learn what you like

491
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,198
and make suggestions of what other movie

492
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,879
you might like and that's basically what

493
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,240
this program does it learns from the

494
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,838
training set

495
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,198
what a gene involved in plant microbe

496
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,279
interactions looks like and then it

497
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,679
suggests other genes and it will break

498
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:40,159
them so we made a training set with

499
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,719
dikia de deyoti and then tried it with

500
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:45,198
effectobacterium

501
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,879
and here's nicole and jeremy working on

502
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,879
this related project but

503
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,560
so

504
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,240
uh

505
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,638
to me it's sort of a

506
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,000
program that replaces the lab pi right

507
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,198
because now we've got a ranked list of

508
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,559
things that students should be working

509
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:04,798
on i don't need to tell the students

510
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:06,318
anymore what chance to focus on

511
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,918
and so this is what one of my students

512
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,399
is now doing is trying to figure out if

513
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,000
the program actually worked so he's

514
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,759
using the ranked list and trying to see

515
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,119
if he can detect that these genes are

516
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:16,720
involved in that micro interactions and

517
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,078
we're looking at all the

518
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,160
ones with no known function and then

519
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,519
he's just taking a random list and

520
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,120
seeing if the machine is doing any

521
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,119
better than just choosing them randomly

522
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,678
okay

523
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,360
anyway while we were working on this

524
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,519
stuff we noticed that these sorts of

525
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,119
papers were coming out so this is from a

526
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,879
group in finland

527
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,038
and they reported a pectobacterium

528
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,039
wasabi sequence and they reported the

529
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,119
sequence of their strain but then they

530
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,400
also included the ones out of our

531
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,159
collection because we never bothered

532
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,280
publishing anything on it

533
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,640
and so this was in 2012 and i called up

534
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,918
the call maybe we should start

535
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,120
publishing something on our genome

536
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,000
sequences they've been sitting out there

537
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,959
for a while and nobody's doing anything

538
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,480
and

539
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,759
you know how things are we didn't have a

540
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,360
student to work on this project we were

541
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,240
both busy with other things so a year

542
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,839
later she sends me this email

543
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,919
which is all you're supposed to see here

544
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,519
is that it's really really long

545
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,120
but this is the key like part of this

546
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,519
email says i have some data for you to

547
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,798
mull over in your spare time

548
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,319
and my hope is that you will look at

549
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,319
these and have immediate and profound

550
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,720
insights and evolutionary innovations in

551
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,000
this clade um she was of course joking

552
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,360
there

553
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,038
and then here was the key part you might

554
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,719
want to stop reading now and so that's

555
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,519
what i did and i put this away for two

556
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,200
months because it was so long and the

557
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,798
file that she sent was so complicated i

558
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,160
just could not deal with it

559
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:33,918
but then we had a really really cold

560
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,320
winter in wisconsin there wasn't much

561
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,559
that anybody could do so i finally

562
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:41,279
opened it up again in january

563
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,279
and she had set this excel file

564
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,000
that had all these extensive comparisons

565
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,519
between 307 genomes and she wanted to

566
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,798
know

567
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,400
could we make a story out of this

568
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,918
and so i spent the next six months

569
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,120
looking at this trying to figure out

570
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,840
what

571
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,839
did it mean

572
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,119
and so

573
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,440
what would you do with this kind of

574
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,239
comparison so my background again it's

575
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,360
more mutating genes and looking at the

576
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,120
biology of things and not in

577
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,479
bioinformatics so i felt like i was a

578
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,918
first year grad student trying to figure

579
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,079
this out

580
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,160
i use this this mural here's inspiration

581
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,319
a lot for what we do in the lab so is

582
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,640
there is there are there any medicine

583
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,480
people do you guys recognize this

584
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,240
no okay

585
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,480
this is the mifflin street co-op the old

586
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,319
co-op and this is a mural that's painted

587
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,038
of the idealized food system that they

588
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,558
were trying to create um

589
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,319
and uh

590
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,918
it's it's an example of where you would

591
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,240
find enterobacteria in the environment

592
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,240
too right it's everywhere it's in the

593
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,558
water and the soil and the

594
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,240
plants we eat and the people

595
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:47,038
okay so we've got

596
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,000
genomes from this environment and what

597
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,000
can we learn from that

598
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,639
so we decided to focus on two questions

599
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,919
um

600
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,440
because we only wanted to write one

601
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,080
paper and

602
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,679
the rate we were going um and nicole's

603
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,839
main interest is

604
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,360
this this clade of bacteria that

605
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,599
includes the soft drop bacteria in the

606
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,119
brain area

607
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,199
where where do they come from what is

608
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,239
their common ancestor so we think they

609
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,880
were either

610
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,359
related to the common they have yersidia

611
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,280
as a as the next closest relative or e

612
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,119
coli of salmonella

613
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,879
and so could we figure that out we've

614
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,519
she's been trying to do this for the

615
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,960
last 15 years without a clear answer

616
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,240
with all of these genomes we find the

617
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,679
right set of genes to give us that

618
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,279
answer

619
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,759
and then i was interested in what both

620
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,119
of us are interested in can we identify

621
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,798
genes that were important that were

622
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,199
acquired by this common ancestor that

623
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,960
helped this clay become

624
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,519
plant pathogens or to become the type of

625
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,120
plant pathogen that they are

626
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,720
so and what would those genes look like

627
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,319
who are they

628
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,679
okay so i don't have a good figure for

629
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,000
this

630
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,640
tree this question that nicole had is is

631
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,159
it derived from a common ancestor that's

632
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,440
similar to your seniority coli and

633
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,960
salmonella because we don't have the

634
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,720
answer yet

635
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,480
it turns out two-thirds of the genes

636
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,000
support one answer and one-third support

637
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,480
a different answer and she can't figure

638
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,319
out how to do the statistics to decide

639
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,679
if any of those signals are correct so

640
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,279
she's working right now with a

641
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,640
statistician

642
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,720
to try to answer what seems like a

643
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,400
simple question

644
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,159
but we were at least able to get a good

645
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,640
um

646
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,640
idea of how the the strains within the

647
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,240
clade were this group were related

648
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,080
so then we we try to go after this

649
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,159
question instead so what genes are more

650
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,918
common in this group of bacteria than

651
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,559
another enterobacteria and that's a big

652
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,080
piece of what's in this excel file

653
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:38,240
and then we wanted to see okay if we get

654
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,918
this class of genes does it match any of

655
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,159
the other data sets we have so do they

656
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,240
tend to be regulated by corn sensing do

657
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,679
they tend to be expressed in plants do

658
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,038
they tend to be things that this machine

659
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,798
learning program picked up so we can

660
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,038
take this set and put it against all

661
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:54,079
these other

662
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,079
sets of data that we have

663
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,519
so one of the first things that

664
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,879
surprised me or i thought was

665
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,000
interesting is that the genes that we

666
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,360
identified as more commonly found in

667
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,599
this group of plant pathogens and

668
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,879
another enterobacteria tended to be near

669
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,480
trnas

670
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,200
and they didn't tend to be linked to

671
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,798
really obvious mobile elements

672
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,798
so

673
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,918
you didn't it's not completely true but

674
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:19,679
that's

675
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,679
that was one thing that really stood out

676
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,519
okay so i you know if i was teaching a

677
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,439
class i divide you into groups of five

678
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,720
right now and ask you to write a list of

679
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,279
um

680
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,360
genes that that are probably more common

681
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,558
in the scrutiny plant pathogens and than

682
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,639
related animal pathogens or

683
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,038
environmental bacteria and and here's

684
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,559
some symptom pictures i've shown you so

685
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:42,558
what do you think we would find

686
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:47,839
plants have all the green enzymes yeah

687
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,520
so that that was

688
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,199
definitely in the set

689
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,480
so that's the first thing

690
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,880
i wanted to show you

691
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,319
so this felt good i was we we should

692
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,679
have found the plant cell degrading

693
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,200
enzymes that are responsible for the

694
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,159
symptoms we see with this group of

695
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,038
pathogens and that was what got spit out

696
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,559
by the

697
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:05,519
database

698
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:07,839
um

699
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,839
it was really helpful though to see this

700
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,359
complete list from the the 20 plant

701
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,599
pathogen genomes we're looking at and

702
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,399
then comparing it to the 280 some other

703
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:18,319
genomes because it helped us figure out

704
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,559
what the loci are and get some idea of

705
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,519
how these may have been acquired

706
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,960
so for example there's 21 loci encoding

707
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,359
plant cell wall degrading enzymes in

708
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,880
both cledicia ectobacterium

709
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,479
and there's six in bruneria i was

710
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,240
surprised to see so many plant cellular

711
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,440
degrading enzymes and these genomes that

712
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,440
i had been thinking of as as peptolytic

713
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,840
of these six there's one that's widely

714
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,840
present in the electrobacteria aca so

715
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,038
it's in your sinead e coli

716
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,720
as well

717
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:47,279
and it's got hell w

718
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,839
and this pectin methyl esterase here and

719
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,319
then an uptake

720
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,319
system so

721
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,640
okay and the the other thing that i

722
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,038
thought was really interesting of these

723
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,880
six conserved loci that are in these

724
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,158
three genera

725
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,400
they're really diverse so there's a

726
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,400
peptide lies there's two cellulases

727
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,880
there's a polyglactoronics the pectoral

728
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,960
cell estrace and i think this might

729
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,880
possibly be involved in plant cell wall

730
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,400
degrading activities too but nobody's

731
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,240
looked at it it's a synolic acid

732
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,000
decarboxylase

733
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,599
and this is just one of these examples

734
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,119
like we've been struggling as we've been

735
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,079
trying to write this up how do we not

736
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,918
have a

737
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,678
you know 50 figures in this paper what

738
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,559
are the the key things and so i found

739
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,400
that as a struggle and i was trying to

740
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,759
describe this too but this is a

741
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,919
typical example of what one of these

742
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,158
loci would look like bruneria will have

743
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,440
one of the genes and then one or the

744
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,120
other of these

745
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,880
other two general will have several

746
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,479
other plant cell wall degrading enzymes

747
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,880
of different classes stuck into that

748
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,880
locus

749
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,440
in this case

750
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,639
for example indica there's three pectate

751
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,240
lysis

752
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,200
this conserved py and then a pectin

753
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,640
so

754
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,960
yeah

755
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,640
what that one is right now

756
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,679
and all the subsequent acquisitions

757
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,278
beyond these six um loci

758
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,360
tend to be enzymes that are still within

759
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,119
those same six classes with a few

760
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,119
exceptions

761
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,599
and we don't see like

762
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,199
enzyme types that are in one indica but

763
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,199
not pectobacterium they seem to have the

764
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,480
same types of activities although not

765
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,640
necessarily the same enzymes

766
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,640
so

767
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,678
okay

768
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,360
and we're still left with the question

769
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,880
people have been asking for a long time

770
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,278
what's the benefit of having all these

771
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,360
loci developments dedicated to the

772
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,519
plant cell wall degrading enzymes i

773
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,798
wonder if it's analogous to the story

774
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,720
that we see with the

775
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,879
effectors in the type 3 secretion system

776
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,038
if

777
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,640
the plants are defending against these

778
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,158
enzymes for example we do know plants

779
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,840
can make inhibitors and affect these

780
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,840
enzymes and that's how well composition

781
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,599
differs among plant species so maybe

782
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,319
they do need to keep acquiring enzymes

783
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,278
to

784
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,278
maintain a broadhost range

785
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,679
um i wanted to just touch on on this

786
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,960
this is a something um we published one

787
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,400
paper in this area we're still working a

788
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,000
little bit on this so

789
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,440
when we do these analyses some sets of

790
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,919
genes just keep popping to the top of

791
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,000
the list all the time and one of them

792
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,000
is the

793
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,038
this fermentation pathway that ends in

794
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,839
either acetone or butanol

795
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,000
and so

796
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,519
every analysis we did this came up right

797
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,558
at the top is something interesting so

798
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:32,240
we finally looked at it more carefully

799
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:33,359
and this this will tie back to the

800
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,839
pectin

801
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,678
biases in a second so it's it's a very

802
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:41,519
small gene cluster that's got a

803
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,679
regulatory gene and then three enzymes

804
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,200
that take um it's the mixed acid

805
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,038
fermentation pathway so it starts with

806
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,319
pyruvate and then goes to either one of

807
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,839
these two

808
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,599
endpoints depending on whether that gene

809
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,439
is present or not this isn't in all of

810
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:54,480
the strings

811
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,080
and

812
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,759
if you've taken an intro micro course

813
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,599
you've probably played with this

814
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,278
reaction it's

815
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,038
what the vogue's prosper

816
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,278
reaction detects and it's the way that

817
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,879
we tell if coliform bacterium like you

818
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,558
call it salmonella are present in water

819
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,520
samples for example

820
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:10,798
versus

821
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,240
enterobacteria that we don't have to

822
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,240
worry about that are plant pathogens

823
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,000
it's because this pathway is present in

824
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,400
a lot of the environmental ones like

825
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,319
pectobacterium but absent from the human

826
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,759
pathogens

827
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,119
but it turns out these compounds are

828
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,480
really interesting i think they've been

829
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,479
kind of ignored

830
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,240
by a lot of us so

831
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,919
they connect they're volatiles that act

832
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,839
as insect hormones

833
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,880
they inhibit the ethylene response in

834
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,839
plants

835
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,278
and they

836
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,199
are pretty alkaline so they raise the ph

837
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,119
and that comes back to soft

838
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,360
pathogenicity

839
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:46,000
because under anaerobic conditions this

840
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:49,119
pathway is really odd and the potato

841
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,960
becomes more but the environment becomes

842
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,798
more alkaline and the plant cell wall

843
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,840
degrading enzymes are really only active

844
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,278
at ph8 so it's a way for the

845
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,079
if the bacterium didn't have this

846
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,278
pathway those enzymes would be no good

847
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,038
right

848
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:06,798
you couldn't use them

849
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,798
all this shows is a this is just

850
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:17,000
this has been a production of cornell

851
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,000
university on the web at cornell.edu
