1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,000
University good morning everyone thanks

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,879
Lynn for very nice

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,480
introduction um I'm also very fortunate

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,679
to work with Lynn because she's an

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,320
amazing with scientist and I think

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,679
working together you will see that in

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,518
our presentation today we are doing such

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:27,359
a good job I think as we scientist um so

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:30,079
my presentation today will be really on

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,759
novel Technologies um applied to

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,199
specialty crop on just showcasing some

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,359
of the uh projects that L and I have

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,840
been working over the last three to four

15
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,238
years with these new technologies this

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,840
way uh just my background very quick I

17
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,599
mean like Lynn mentioned I'm an

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,199
associate professor on extension

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,719
specialist in wheat science for

20
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:53,439
specialty crops um I have have a trueway

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,558
split where I'm I'm doing research I'm

22
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:59,399
doing extension I'm doing teaching but

23
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,439
basically it's 100% all the time um

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,239
especially this semester four semester

25
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,719
for me is really big semester for

26
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:06,920
teaching I have two class and I'm

27
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:10,239
teaching in semester in four semester

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,478
I'm teaching uh we San sat and I'm also

29
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,478
teaching an introduction to

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,439
articulture so my resarch station is

31
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,798
located at the Philip IM maruchi

32
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,199
blueberry and crownberry research and

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,600
Extension Center right in the middle of

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,359
the pine Baron sou part of New Jersey um

35
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:30,679
initially I did a lot of work on

36
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,599
blueberry on cranberry uh but over the

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,960
years I expanded that to Specialty crops

38
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:37,000
including veggies and tree fruits at the

39
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,959
station we have a very diverse group of

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,799
researcher uh we have people from USDA

41
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:46,078
uh on on rodg um breeding uh doing work

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,360
on cranberry and blueberry breeding we

43
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,559
have a bioinformatician we have a

44
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,078
diverse team of enologists plant

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,000
pathologist and wheat scientists and we

46
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,359
have also a molecular biology as well

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,478
and since we are working on cranberry we

48
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,879
have someone from Ocean Spray which is

49
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:04,679
located on our resar station as

50
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:07,118
well so yes I mention

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,520
it what are specialty crops you know

52
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,520
that will be the topic of what we are

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,040
discussing today but special Chups for

54
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,319
me in my opinion are any fruits bearing

55
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,878
a plant that is not so filor or wheat

56
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:19,238
which doesn't exclude the fact that from

57
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,799
time to time I can do soybean work as

58
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,599
well but everything else truthfully for

59
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,840
us in new is considered specialty crops

60
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:29,280
uh my research on extension focus is

61
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,759
really on cranberry uh because New Jers

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,080
is wrong Kingdom number three in the US

63
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,318
blueberry we're ranking number five

64
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,719
Peach We're still ranking number five in

65
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:40,479
in in the US on in the veggies uh New

66
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,080
Jersey is ranking relatively high for

67
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,719
for pepper so I did uh in the in the

68
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,560
last few years I did work on pepper

69
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:51,120
cooker bits asparagus and I'm increasing

70
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,080
my work on Grape as well okay and when I

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,840
was mentioning the maruchi center the

72
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,920
maruchi center is located right here in

73
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,878
the pons but I have extension I have

74
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,719
research site in South Jersey right here

75
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,439
at Ric and I have also research site at

76
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,560
Snider in Northern J so different type

77
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,359
of environmental condition between South

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,840
J uh on on North J which is probably

79
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,840
closer from what you have here in New

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,200
York so just I mean some of you know

81
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,560
what we're are doing in in my research

82
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,878
in my we s team at rers uh we try to

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,280
understand the biology and Ecology of

84
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:28,798
Valu weed species that treat the

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,719
sustainability sustainability and profit

86
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,719
profitability of major uh new ja

87
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:36,519
specialty crop we are uh looking at

88
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,959
developing integrated weed management

89
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,360
practices to provide effective and

90
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,920
economically viable strategies and

91
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,799
definitely over the last few years we

92
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:48,359
have been doing a lot of work assessing

93
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,200
the risk and benefits of uh New U uh new

94
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,640
we control Technologies for new J

95
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,639
specialty

96
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,519
crops yes when we're looking at weeds I

97
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,400
mean it's always good but what we'll be

98
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,000
discussing today in context but why are

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,599
weeds really important for specialty

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,239
crops well if you're looking at uh what

101
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:09,798
would be the Y losses uh due to

102
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,480
unmanaged weeds in some of the major

103
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:15,000
North American crops everything else

104
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,439
being conducted perfectly meaning that

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,160
you're getting good vertiz you're

106
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:21,600
getting good disase on insect control if

107
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,919
you just let the weed compete uh you're

108
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,199
getting between 50 and 70% yeld losses

109
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:29,758
for some of these U major crops so for

110
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,079
soybean for example that will be

111
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,720
equivalent I mean we are losing around1

112
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:38,879
17 billion doar each year due to weed

113
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,720
management issues uh same thing for corn

114
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:47,719
dve in Sor dve in seven over 700 million

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,720
doar of of Y loss caused by by weat

116
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:55,879
competition so the direct competition

117
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:58,599
for nutrients or water or any kind of

118
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:01,079
resource is not the on impact of weeds

119
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,720
you have other impact to consider some

120
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,439
of these Weed really reduce Harvest

121
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,960
efficiency right here you're looking at

122
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,038
Palmer amarant in corn look at the size

123
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,719
of Palmer yes it's me right on the

124
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,719
picture I'm not small Palmer can grow

125
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,000
extremely tall and when you're starting

126
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,960
to get Palmer in a cornfield clearly

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,600
when you will be harvesting just the

128
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,318
fact that you have Palmer will reduce

129
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,360
not just your yield but the speed at

130
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,319
which you can harvest the crop as well

131
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,560
uh this one is a picture that I took in

132
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,879
in blueberry what you see right here is

133
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,879
daughter growing in blueberry and

134
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:35,159
daughter can be extremely parasitic and

135
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:36,839
cause severe yield losses in blueberry

136
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,360
just because it's a parasitic plant so

137
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,560
we have daughter in blueberry we have

138
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,160
dter and cranberry so yes I mean

139
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,360
parasitism is something to consider some

140
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,000
of these wheat can also be o for pest on

141
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,280
uh on disease so that's something to

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,560
consider as well and the last thing is

143
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,559
probably my one of my favorite weed uh

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,478
just because it's it's in in Cranberry

145
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,759
right here so you're looking at

146
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:59,879
cranberry on everything that you see

147
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,120
which is kind of yellow brownish is

148
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,120
actually called Carolina Redwood I spent

149
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,240
a lot of time before getting tenure

150
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,639
working on Carolina Redwood and that was

151
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,759
really interesting because you cranberry

152
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,038
is a really low growing crop and you

153
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,840
have this Carolina Redwood which is

154
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:18,478
overwhelming dominating the cranberry

155
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,758
canopy so when you're applying fungicide

156
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,719
when you're applying insecticide to

157
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,800
Cranberry most of the spray will be uh

158
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,680
intercepted by the Carolina railro so

159
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,680
just because you have the weeds uh you

160
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,120
will affect other Management program as

161
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,519
well you will not get your insecticide

162
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,199
you will not get your fungicide where

163
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,198
you need them to

164
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,280
be okay so when we're talking about

165
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,038
weeds um herbicide is still the number

166
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:51,559
one solution for weed management so in

167
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:55,680
2022 there was um around two

168
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,720
266 million Acres of crops in in the

169
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,199
United States that were treated with

170
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,879
herbicide so it's it's a domino

171
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,038
um in term of aage is really the

172
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,840
dominant pesticide that we are using for

173
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:09,598
for managing

174
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,679
pest um however this can be rapidly

175
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:15,159
changing the big problem that we are

176
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,759
facing on vpan onl will not deny it

177
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,240
because they are also working on that

178
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,879
but clearly I mean herbicide resistance

179
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,478
is really a major issue that we are

180
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,280
facing these days is

181
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:30,800
533 unique case of herbicide resistant

182
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:33,918
to 168 herb that have been documented in

183
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,038
the US meaning that aide that were at

184
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:39,120
some point controlling these weeds uh at

185
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,120
a specific rate are not controlling the

186
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,399
weeds anymore because the weeds evolve

187
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,360
resistance okay they were

188
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:48,158
able either by by different way to to to

189
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,199
survive this resist to this abide

190
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:52,759
application we have export Market access

191
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,680
especially when you're starting to look

192
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,120
exporting to Europe some of these

193
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,000
herbicide may not be accepted in other

194
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,439
countries so uh we we may have ction on

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,839
what we can export to Europe or or or

196
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:07,478
China any anywhere else consumer

197
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,439
perception I mean more and more

198
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:12,639
consumers are reluctant to the use of

199
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,319
pesticide including herbicide of course

200
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,439
and the last thing which is really to

201
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,199
consider as well is that yes I mean when

202
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,038
you're using a pesticide it's not

203
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,439
something which is neutral I mean you

204
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:23,800
have to take into account the fact that

205
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,439
you need to protect your worker on some

206
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,840
of these aide also I mean you heard

207
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,759
about 24d or D combat drift some of

208
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:33,038
these a that may be causing a lot of

209
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,719
injury to to to other crop as well so

210
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:38,120
that's something to consider on that

211
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,278
that's that has been a problem in recent

212
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,278
year with some specific

213
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:46,519
herbicides uh increasing prevalence of

214
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:49,799
of herbicide resistant weeds yes many of

215
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:52,240
the herbicide resistant Cas are located

216
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,958
known for soybean corn wheat and baray

217
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,600
and rice but if you're looking at

218
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,359
specialty crop if you're looking at our

219
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,480
chart we're actually number six uh in

220
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,240
term of AR number of case of herbicide

221
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,200
resistance so it's not just something

222
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,159
which is for agronomic crops it's also

223
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,079
something which is affecting us in

224
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,879
specialty

225
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:14,359
crops and just a picture of what we have

226
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:17,759
in New Jersey on L on vipan could draw

227
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,200
the same table for for New York but yes

228
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,240
I mean the first case of herbicide

229
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,800
resistance in New Jersey was documented

230
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,519
in 1980 smooth P grid resistant to the

231
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,159
photosystem to inhibitor atrazine

232
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,480
simazine and metrozine and just last

233
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:34,039
year I mean I documented a new case in

234
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,839
New Jersey where we have a goose grass

235
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:38,360
evolving resistance to glyphosate in

236
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,079
soybean field which is also a problem

237
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,919
for us in specialty crops because many

238
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:45,719
of these weeds will not just stick to

239
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:47,319
the soybeans they will move to the crop

240
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,360
cropping system especially if you're

241
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,440
looking at New Jersey we have a very uh

242
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,278
intricate network of crop where you may

243
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,399
have a soybean field on next to it you

244
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:58,240
will get a Blueberry field so guess what

245
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,240
I mean these Goose spaces will love

246
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,079
moving into the Blueberry Field

247
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,959
so that's some that's something to

248
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:09,120
consider ored uh my team will be working

249
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:11,759
on investigating ore resistant to parat

250
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,480
and potentially to mesotron as well so

251
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,919
we have constant case of potential aad

252
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,039
resistance that that are popping up in

253
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,958
in in New Jers as

254
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:24,159
well the big game changer these days is

255
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:27,559
also the fact that we have some new

256
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,879
regulatory changes that are um that that

257
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:33,399
we have to face especially regarding the

258
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:36,679
dunger spes act so all federal agencies

259
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:39,039
including the EPA U who are registering

260
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:42,719
pesticide must ensure that the action

261
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:45,838
they carry out fund or authorized does

262
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,278
not negatively impact treat on UND

263
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,720
dangerous bases of their critical

264
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,519
habitat and one good example for us in

265
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,879
the East including uh New Jersey and New

266
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,200
York I'm goates in New York as well the

267
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,480
B turtle is one of these uner spes that

268
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,240
we need to consider in term of

269
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,440
protection and making sure that when you

270
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,959
are using herbicide Insecticide

271
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,480
Fungicide uh the use of these pesticide

272
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:11,799
will not be putting a great or treat on

273
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,120
on Spaces that are already uner so these

274
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:18,278
days there is a new EPA uner spaces act

275
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,440
work plan for herbicide uh that has been

276
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:23,559
uh that has been produc produced on on

277
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,240
basically the plan will introduce some

278
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:28,479
new restriction on the use of some of

279
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,839
these abides so our Growers will have to

280
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,278
face uh new mitigation measures for

281
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,680
reducing spread Rift reducing runoff

282
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,838
erosion and potentially reducing any

283
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:42,039
kind of other speci measures that will

284
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:44,399
reduce pde exposure to uh to uner

285
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:46,360
species on their habitat so clearly I

286
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,360
mean if you're looking at the picture of

287
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,919
using herbicide these days we are

288
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,120
getting into a different environment

289
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,679
we'll not get the same Freedom at using

290
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,799
herbicide probably in the future so

291
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,679
clearly that may make that can make

292
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,559
every side more difficult to use so we

293
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,278
need to start looking at What

294
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,759
alternative we can have to

295
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,759
herdes um so there was a paper publish

296
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:09,519
in 2018 2018 looking at what will be

297
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,559
with Management in

298
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,480
2050 um we know that herbicide are not

299
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,479
going away we'll still need to use some

300
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,800
of this herbicide we don't know in some

301
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,680
situation how to replace them um I also

302
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,120
want to point out that we don't have any

303
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,958
new mode of actions that have been

304
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,759
released um across large acreage on

305
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,679
specialty crops in 30 years so there is

306
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,399
nothing in the pipe basically

307
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,000
if you're looking at other disciplines

308
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,720
in pathology onology yes they're getting

309
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,278
new pesticide new Insecticide Fungicide

310
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,278
that's not the case for us in in in weat

311
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,838
science so that's also something which

312
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,159
is stimulating the fact that we need

313
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,040
really to look at these new technologies

314
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,879
biological control um L and I were in a

315
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,838
class with Steve before we're discussing

316
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:54,639
that but we don't really have biological

317
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,600
control in weat science okay if you're

318
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,399
an enologist you know that you can use

319
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,199
some biological control for controlling

320
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,600
insect we don't have this kind of

321
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:04,240
opportunity uh in with science um

322
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,159
there's work which is conducted on on

323
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,278
uning crop biology for improving the the

324
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,559
crop competitiveness that's something

325
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,439
that needs to be further developed but

326
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:17,039
most of what we're doing these days is

327
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,639
really looking at these Nel new tools uh

328
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,039
looking at Precision Agriculture and

329
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,399
looking at robotic equipment uh that can

330
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:26,679
be U not replacing but supplementing the

331
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,519
use of

332
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:30,039
herbicides so that's what we'll be

333
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,519
discussing

334
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:35,278
today and I will discuss three different

335
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,198
type of technologies that um uh I've

336
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,360
been investigating um L investigated the

337
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:42,479
same kind of Technology as well so we'll

338
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,639
be looking at targeted spraying right

339
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,079
here we'll be looking at autonomous

340
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,159
Ceder on weer on the last one the most

341
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:52,919
exciting one is looking at Laser weer

342
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:55,600
using laser for killing the

343
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,399
weed so the first one which is really

344
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,519
what I'm calling the op optically

345
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,198
targeted abide spring and that's

346
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,839
something that we did in in ibush

347
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:07,159
blueberry and and Lin conducted the same

348
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,720
experiment uh looking at grape um so

349
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:12,039
this kind of Technology oh well my two

350
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,278
principal collaborator well ly of course

351
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:19,519
but I'm also ly and I we worked a lot

352
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:20,958
with a um with Roger b a uh because this

353
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,000
project was considered to be an

354
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,399
integrated solution so coming up with

355
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,360
something that can be reduce the amount

356
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:30,278
of ab that we are using so IU was

357
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,680
financially supporting this project the

358
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:34,240
project that I will present so when

359
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,638
we're looking at blueberries there is

360
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,399
different challenges when you're growing

361
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,120
blueberries the first one is that you're

362
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,039
not working on a flat ground you're

363
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,240
working on ill rad so you are working on

364
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,078
three-dimensional surface if you want

365
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,120
which when you're applying aide when

366
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,278
you're applying any kind of anything to

367
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,360
the soil may be more challenging uh we

368
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:54,958
have a lot of drip irrigation and I've

369
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,199
never been a big fan of drip irrigation

370
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,919
why because you have an single entry

371
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:02,000
point of water where you can wash out

372
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,120
wash off all theide out of the salt

373
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,159
profile so for me that's something

374
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,039
challenging to work with um we have we

375
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:12,360
population that are consisting of annual

376
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,360
weeds we we can deal with that but we

377
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,320
have also a lot of prual weed spaces

378
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,879
you're working with the penal crops and

379
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,879
you will see that in wheat science many

380
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,120
peral wheat spaces are really associated

381
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,198
with penal cropping system and we don't

382
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,399
have a lot of herbicide that can really

383
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:30,879
uh tackle these peral weed spaces um

384
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,600
something which is also to consider with

385
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,879
in term of wind management for blueberri

386
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,120
that blueberries are developing from new

387
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:39,759
canes okay so each year you have

388
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,600
production of new canes that will be the

389
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,519
support of future production for the

390
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,800
crop so you need to make sure that when

391
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,078
you app playing herbicide you save these

392
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:50,000
new canes you don't damage you don't

393
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:53,278
damage these new canes because otherwise

394
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,958
you will geop parize your potential uh

395
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,159
your yield potential in the future uh we

396
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,919
have a relatively narrow for uh weed

397
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,639
control especially with post emergence

398
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,120
because when you're looking at Blueberry

399
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:05,399
this way when they're starting to be

400
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,759
loaded with blueberry what will happen

401
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,399
is that many of these Branch will start

402
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,759
bending over Z row and when it happens

403
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,679
there is no way you can get any kind of

404
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,519
equipment moving between the rows for

405
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,919
cultivating or applying herbicide so

406
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,399
that will narrow the time at during

407
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,719
which you can apply herbicide and

408
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,879
definitely you can see it on this

409
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,199
picture but we really have a lot of

410
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:33,360
Reliance on on cultivation on some soil

411
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,359
between the rows which is a challenge as

412
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:39,120
well okay so why Burberry with control

413
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:40,958
matters well most of our blueberry in

414
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,159
New Jersey are grown on sun acidic soil

415
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:47,239
with low M low low water retention um

416
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:48,639
the crop has a very shallow root system

417
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,318
which means that yes if you have any

418
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,560
kind of competition especially with the

419
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:55,240
weeds because you have really um you

420
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,000
have very low water retention in the

421
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,039
soil I mean the Wheats will be extremely

422
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,278
competitive for you know for for or

423
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:04,959
pumping water um so yes the crop is

424
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:06,959
really highly sensitive to water stress

425
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,519
as well as disease on insect pest so you

426
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,000
really need to get good weed control

427
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,759
because yes it's it's weats can be

428
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,640
quickly be a problem weeds can be also p

429
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,640
on disease I man I mentioned it before

430
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,360
uh and again I mean Wheats can prevent

431
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,679
proper targeting of insecticide on

432
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,639
Fungicide and if you look at the next

433
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:28,280
slide right here you see what I mean um

434
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,120
you're looking at aeed right here

435
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:34,319
growing in blueberry and typically these

436
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:36,479
ored if they are not managed early on

437
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,240
they can grow taller than the blueberry

438
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,720
and they can really intercept any

439
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,319
insecticide or fungicide same as I was

440
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,400
showing before with scina redwoods why

441
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,480
do we have ored issues in blueberry

442
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,280
because still many Growers are relying

443
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,000
on glyphosate for controlling ore and

444
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,839
this is a perfect case of herbicide

445
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,880
resistance of glyphosate resistance we

446
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,519
know that our population of ored are

447
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,559
completely resistant to glyphosate we

448
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:02,359
cannot kill them with glyphosate it

449
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,599
takes time for Growers to integrate the

450
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:05,519
fact that they need to change their

451
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,959
practices that glyphosate may not be the

452
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,960
solution

453
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,559
anymore all right so when we're talking

454
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,319
about optically guided targeted spray

455
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,519
system for weed control what may be the

456
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,599
advantage of this system okay when we're

457
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,400
using the abde we want the abde to be

458
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,678
especially postemergence abde the one

459
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,120
you appli on we have emerged you want

460
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,440
this abide to be precisely located on on

461
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,279
the way that you want to control so if

462
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,960
you're using something that can just

463
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,720
apply the abide exactly where you need

464
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,480
it that would be great because you can

465
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,279
reduce the volume of abide that you

466
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,880
apply annually instead of doing a

467
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,038
Broadcast application you're just

468
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,400
applying the Abad where it should be uh

469
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,000
you're reducing the crop injury

470
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,798
potential associated with post abide

471
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,640
application because you just apply Z

472
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:52,519
abide to the weeds you don't apply

473
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,600
theide on a broadcast basis um what we

474
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:56,519
did in this study that we also try to

475
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:59,038
evaluate new herbicide that are not

476
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:01,918
specifically labeled for a crop using

477
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:04,079
system because be you since you can

478
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,038
potentially reduce the damage CA to the

479
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,639
crop you can eventually consider that

480
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:11,839
new abde may be label because you will

481
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,799
reduce amount of injury to the crop um

482
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,879
on event that could be considered as a

483
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:18,119
mitigation strategy for preventing of

484
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:22,559
Target herbicide movement that could

485
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:24,079
negatively impact uh T species so again

486
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,798
I mean you don't do a Broadcast

487
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,199
application you just put the Abad weight

488
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:31,759
needs to be

489
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,880
so so this this system a whe it system

490
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,158
uh you can see it right here used in

491
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,039
agronomic crops um and I will explain

492
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,520
the way it's working but clearly you

493
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,919
cannot apply this kind of system in

494
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:45,558
agronomic drops in a in specialty crops

495
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,880
if you want to work in specialty crops

496
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:49,678
we opt we decided to use a smaller

497
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,280
system which is really mounted on this

498
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,919
ATV and you have a detection system

499
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,678
right here and you have the spray system

500
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,120
associated with it so very smaller

501
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,759
system but more practical um you know

502
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,038
than than using this kind of system but

503
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:04,640
again the technology the basic

504
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:06,599
technology is the

505
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,960
same it's

506
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:12,759
working so the way it's working is that

507
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,880
um you have a sensor right here which is

508
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:18,558
meting blue light okay this blue light

509
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,120
will be absorbed by the weed chide by

510
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,639
any kind of vegetation if you want and

511
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,759
in turn after absorbing the blue light

512
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,080
the chlorophile will uh will produce

513
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,359
will emit near infrared in reaction to

514
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:33,480
the blue light

515
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:37,038
these neide will be sensed by the sensor

516
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,519
on the sensor will actuate um uh will

517
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,599
trigger a spray boom so that will

518
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,279
trigger the application of Abad exactly

519
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,519
where you detected

520
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,399
cile so you can see it right here you

521
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:50,599
have the sensor which is located right

522
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,840
here you have the picture of the sensor

523
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:55,079
projecting blue light on the ground uh

524
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:57,279
and it's divided in one two three four

525
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,599
different section each section is

526
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,279
corresponding to a specific number

527
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:03,158
nuzzle so you have four different

528
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:05,960
independent nuzzle that can just uh

529
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:08,720
independently apply herbicide where

530
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,159
weeds have been detected by the

531
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,558
sensor so we had this project in 21 uh

532
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,520
21

533
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:19,639
2022 both in New Jersey on New York uh

534
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,639
Lyn was working on Grape and I was

535
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:25,200
working on blueberry and again this

536
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,278
project was funded by by a for um within

537
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,679
the integrated solution

538
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:32,759
program so our goal were really to

539
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,880
evaluate the potential to safely apply

540
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:38,440
novel and non-registered abide using a

541
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,278
commercially available optically guided

542
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,320
spray system and we wanted to compare

543
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:46,359
this system the efficacy of this system

544
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:49,038
with a regular Broadcast

545
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:51,119
application so we tested different T and

546
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,119
I will not get into the detail but

547
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,879
basically we had references right here

548
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:59,000
glos glufosinate was our standard abide

549
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,880
that blueberry and gra grow can use I

550
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,480
was you also using two forine in

551
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,200
blueberry because it's labeled for use

552
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,720
in blueberry it's not labeled for use in

553
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,519
grape no uh everything in red right it

554
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,839
was new Abid that we tested to check if

555
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,759
there was you know if using this pre

556
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,319
Precision system would improve crop

557
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,599
safety using using the Abid on you had

558
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:22,918
two different application method either

559
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:25,038
bonded or or using the we it

560
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,320
system so if you're looking at we

561
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:30,038
control in blueberry uh four weeks after

562
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:32,158
application I look at three different

563
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:36,558
major weeds in our Blueberry Plantation

564
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:39,000
ground cell ored b Lane we had similar

565
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:41,720
level of weed control using either a

566
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,278
regular bonded Broadcast application

567
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,798
compared to the optically guided weed it

568
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:49,919
system so uh in term of pure we control

569
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:52,960
efficacy Effectiveness we have the same

570
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,278
level of efficacy between the two system

571
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,200
uh where it started to be really

572
00:22:54,278 --> 00:23:00,240
interesting is that if you're looking at

573
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:03,319
crop uh injury uh really right here uh

574
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,880
that was grape canopy injury Lan

575
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:07,720
observed increasing injury over time

576
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,440
with some of these herbicide with a

577
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,400
bonded application which was not the

578
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,000
case of vision guided application um so

579
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,840
the way we are thinking it's working

580
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,278
that yes some of these systemic

581
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,959
herbicide may have been taken up by the

582
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:23,759
plant and because you do a bonded

583
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,319
application we have you have more heride

584
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,759
that can be potentially absorbed by the

585
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:30,038
plant compared to uh the vision guided

586
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,919
where you just put side on the we when

587
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:34,440
you're looking in blueberry we had a

588
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,038
different picture in blueberry okay we

589
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,400
saw especially if you're looking at the

590
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:41,919
new cane stunting we saw more damage on

591
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,400
new canes more stunting associated with

592
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,640
a vision guided in red uh application as

593
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,600
compared to the bonded application on

594
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,440
the think I mean my hypothesis is that

595
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,278
definitely this kind of system it's nice

596
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,919
but it's not artificial intelligence

597
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,319
you're just talking about a sensor which

598
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:58,880
is detecting cile so there's no

599
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:01,319
difference between the C profile of

600
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,559
blueberry plant on the Crile of a weed

601
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:05,839
so clearly especially on on the new

602
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:07,918
canes we applied herbicide on the new

603
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:11,119
canes because it was sensed it was

604
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:14,640
detected as as a green

605
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:16,359
tissue um that you can see it here we

606
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,960
had two different time of application we

607
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:20,158
had the first application and the second

608
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,679
application right here in the first

609
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,159
application when the canes were

610
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,798
relatively small that's the canes right

611
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,440
here we got a lot of injury the second

612
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,038
application that came later in the

613
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,240
season we saw definitely less injury

614
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,679
because the can started to get bigger so

615
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,278
we less exposed to to the airide

616
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,080
application but that's what you can see

617
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:43,079
on on the herbicide I think that this is

618
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,720
one yes this one was FL peroxy herbicide

619
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:47,879
and you can see that the new can

620
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,880
starting bending it's it's a group W

621
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,480
group four herbicide so you can

622
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:58,039
typically see the damage associated with

623
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,558
uh oxic abde um so different you know

624
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,038
the way you're considering the system if

625
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:03,319
it's grape or blueberry you may have

626
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:07,079
different result using this kind of

627
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:09,200
system did we achieve reduction in aide

628
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,038
use yes definitely when I look at my

629
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,840
data we measure the volume of aide we

630
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:17,480
are using on um looking at Blueberry uh

631
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:20,678
treatment we say between 40 and 55% of

632
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,278
the abide using this system again I mean

633
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,798
we got the same level of weight control

634
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:26,599
the big problem we got in blueberry is

635
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:29,319
that yes because it's not artificially

636
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:32,319
artificial intelligence basis you got

637
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:35,558
injury to the new

638
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:39,720
canes um so that crop injury gave us an

639
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:42,240
ID actually uh in 2024 this year well

640
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,120
yes we conducted a new triol with Lin

641
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,319
where we are looking at evaluating uh

642
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,839
the weed it sprayer right here using it

643
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:51,158
in grape for controlling suckers okay

644
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,038
not trying to control the weed but

645
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,000
really trying to control the suckers you

646
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,960
don't want to get any vegetation growing

647
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,038
on this Str because that's uh nutrient

648
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,880
that we not be available for where you

649
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:06,278
want to get grapes to be produced by the

650
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,480
plant okay so we had two system we had a

651
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:11,319
typical uh spray application that's

652
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,960
where my technician applying um right

653
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:15,798
here applying aide when working on

654
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,679
applying herbicide on the suers right

655
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:21,119
here on the second one was using the we

656
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,679
it sprayer is barely visible but each

657
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,558
time the we it is detecting the green on

658
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,919
the trunk and he applying a beside

659
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:31,918
strictly on on on the suers on the plant

660
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:37,640
so that's data coming from from New York

661
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:41,120
here um Lynn got the same level of um uh

662
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:44,720
sucker control between a traditional on

663
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:46,398
sucker uh removal uh using the one or

664
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,679
using the vision guided the optically

665
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:51,119
guided sprad system the difference

666
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,600
between the two was on the one spray

667
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:57,678
system she uh she used less herbicide

668
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:59,719
compared to the vision gued sprad system

669
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,600
but it was more mostly on this case

670
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,960
because when they spray the ab side they

671
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,319
spray both side okay when with a one

672
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,440
spray they only spray one side of the

673
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:11,558
plant they didn't come back the other

674
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,720
way now if you're looking at um yeah you

675
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:16,480
did some further experimentation on this

676
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,440
one comparing one side application of

677
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,278
the vision guided sprayer versus two

678
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,919
side actually you're getting the same

679
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:26,159
level of biomass reduction um looking at

680
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,919
these two type of application so the

681
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,480
vision guided one side will be providing

682
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,679
the same level of control of of a

683
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,960
regular application uh for us in in New

684
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,720
Jersey again I mean you're looking at

685
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,840
the percentage of fresh rate of the

686
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,360
suckers are as Express as percentage of

687
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:45,319
the non-treated control on removal we

688
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:47,678
were at the end of the season at 6% of

689
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:50,319
what we're getting otherwise without

690
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,519
removing the suckers and we got the same

691
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:56,398
level with the we it sprayer with the

692
00:27:53,519 --> 00:28:00,120
vision sprayer if we are just using the

693
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:02,599
wand yes we get significant ly um better

694
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:05,319
control of the suur but at the same time

695
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,678
you re use twice more herbicide doing

696
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:09,240
that so clearly I mean for The Growers

697
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,798
is not I mean that's what they're doing

698
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,278
the on removal is typically what the

699
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,960
Growers will be doing so they were well

700
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:19,159
I mean if we can save herbicide go

701
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,880
faster just using the vision G sprayer

702
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,760
we we are we are all for it we don't

703
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,240
need to have someone working along the

704
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:29,200
vine along the roads to spray her

705
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,798
besides so what next we a vision guide

706
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,720
sprayer we want to get more automation

707
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:38,519
um Cornell got a great idea it's using

708
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,839
this new robotic um platform the farm NG

709
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,919
Amiga on try to get something fully

710
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:44,879
autonomous so transferring the the

711
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,880
vision guided sprayer to a fully

712
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,278
autonomous platform so you can get U um

713
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,159
you can get application of aad without

714
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,960
having someone driving the ATV like I

715
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,640
show you before so that's where we plan

716
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,600
to go in the future with this system uh

717
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,000
looking at um autonomous platform which

718
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:06,000
is a second type of equipment that we

719
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,640
are looking uh to investigate in um in

720
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:14,519
our research so we were looking at um

721
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:16,440
the the no Nao o autonomous platform um

722
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,240
on it's a project that we conducted yes

723
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,759
with linnn but also with Matt berui on

724
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,359
CLA plas Meer at University of Aransas

725
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:26,038
so it's really a Multistate project

726
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,479
investigating this new platform uh so

727
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:28,798
what are some advantage of robotic

728
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,960
readers

729
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,798
uh with this kind of equipment uh you

730
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,558
can really do weed prevention you can do

731
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,240
early detection and remove all of the

732
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,038
weed before they really start competing

733
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,880
with the crop um this kind of equipment

734
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:44,519
can be extremely precise so we can have

735
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,240
precise targeting on removal of the weed

736
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,640
uh you can reduce herbicide use and

737
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,679
actually what we're doing is that we're

738
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,799
not just using herbicide it's pure

739
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,519
mechanical control uh you have Labor

740
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:58,879
efficiency you don't need someone so

741
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:01,200
it's fully autonomous um scal scal ility

742
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,760
you have big system like I mean the farm

743
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,640
Droid and there are bigger systems than

744
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,240
the farm Droid but you also have very

745
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,640
small system that can be adapted for

746
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,880
very small farming operations on the

747
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,640
last one is cost savings yes you have

748
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,679
initial in high initial investment when

749
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,320
you're buying this kind of system but

750
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:21,038
later based on reduced labor on on the

751
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,918
use of pesticide on reduced use

752
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:26,919
pesticide you can you can saving cost

753
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,120
later as well by by just um using this

754
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,799
kind of equipment

755
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,918
so uh basically Aon platform for me are

756
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:36,398
mostly tool carrier so you will see many

757
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,840
of them fitted with you know finger

758
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:42,398
weers or shunks anything that can

759
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:46,359
mechanically control the weeds um on the

760
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:48,479
one I mean what is really uh necessary

761
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,798
required with this platform is that you

762
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,360
just don't want to use GPS GPS is not

763
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,918
precise enough okay you need to get

764
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,719
something that will give you centimetric

765
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,519
Precision you're planting a crop you

766
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,798
want to make sure that when you're using

767
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,399
cultivation it's killing the weed it's

768
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,158
not killing the crop and sometimes the

769
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:06,959
weed can be growing extremely close to

770
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:09,919
the crop so you need what we're calling

771
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,759
the RO time kinematic uh which is really

772
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,278
a a Next Level GPS if you want where

773
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:16,278
you're getting this centimetric

774
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:18,480
Precision that you need for for

775
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:21,480
controlling the weeds where where they

776
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,480
are so that's what you have right here

777
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,639
on on the Nao o which is really a small

778
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:30,159
robot the on that we are using uh it has

779
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:33,038
a GPS rtk Receiver right here you have a

780
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,559
toolbar in the back um this one is

781
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:38,960
relatively small it's only weighing 300

782
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:41,119
lb uh it's 100% electric uh it's

783
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,679
something also to consider it's not

784
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,158
based on fuel it's really based on

785
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,960
electricity on autonomy it has up to

786
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:50,919
eight hours of autonomy so you can run

787
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,600
it autonomously in the field for eight

788
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:56,120
hours uh what you can do with it is that

789
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,398
yes you can do weeding okay you can do

790
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:00,239
mechanical weeding by using blade on

791
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,719
torsion spring wiers you can use finger

792
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,200
wiers but what I really like with it is

793
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,839
that you can use a Ceder so we have been

794
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,278
using uh a single row Seer attached to

795
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:12,959
the Nao o robot and I like it because

796
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,720
you can create a map of your field you

797
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,919
have a GPS system on board you can

798
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,399
precisely locate where your rose your

799
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:24,399
corn Rose whatever crops you're planting

800
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:26,158
and later you can come back for uh

801
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,398
controlling the weed between the rows

802
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,519
because you know precisely where

803
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:35,798
um you know where um where Z rows are

804
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:38,720
located um so we did some work uh over

805
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:40,798
the last two years now we got it last

806
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,720
year uh we are looking at the efficacy

807
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,200
of autonomous mechanical we control

808
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,200
Based On Tools application frequency on

809
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,440
WE density diversity how do you compare

810
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,960
this kind of tools with a standard

811
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,000
chemical weight control on what is a

812
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,480
crop safety and and I will point out

813
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,440
that right here when you're working with

814
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,440
something like cabbage it's really

815
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,960
important that when you're owing when

816
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,159
you're mechanically controlling the

817
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,798
weeds you're not damaging the crop

818
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:12,000
because otherwise you will see yield

819
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:16,079
reduction so uh sorry we conducted trial

820
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,720
in 2023 at rers Cornell oners of Aransas

821
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:21,158
New Jersey on Aransas we worked on sweet

822
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,480
corn on New Jersey on New York we worked

823
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:27,760
on transplanted cage so you see right

824
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:29,679
here the na o cing Con on right here

825
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,798
walking the ground tining the ground

826
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,080
between the rows of of

827
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:38,158
cabage two videos yep so right here you

828
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:40,158
see the seeding autonomously no one is

829
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,080
controlling the robot it's seing

830
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:46,159
autonomously uh the corn on later again

831
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:47,960
it's fully autonomous you have equipment

832
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,200
which is coming just to control the

833
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,200
weeds between the rows of the

834
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,638
car all right so what kind of data did

835
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:00,120
we get if you're looking at trial we did

836
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:04,079
in 2023 at RG looking at the weed

837
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:06,678
biomass uh we tested different uh one

838
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,480
two or three passes of the n o and when

839
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:10,639
we were getting tree passes we're

840
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,519
getting the same level of weed biomass

841
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,200
reduction than using a standard aide

842
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:18,239
application so yes it works in term of

843
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:22,199
reducing weat pressure Lynn did the same

844
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:24,239
work at cage last year at Corell uh one

845
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,480
pass was sufficient maybe not to provide

846
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,319
the same level of we control as abide

847
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,280
but significantly reduced

848
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,960
we uh we biomass compared to an

849
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,639
untreated

850
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,679
check um right here it's again my a

851
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,480
different Tri we had on cage at reders

852
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,679
we did the O we did four passes We

853
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,719
compare with a standard Premier serde

854
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:50,358
which is prefer we use prefer on three

855
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:53,719
passes of the robot on WE gold tunder

856
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:55,119
right here and clearly uh four passes of

857
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,879
of the O were sufficient to

858
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,320
significantly reduce the biomass on was

859
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,358
at the same level of what you will

860
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,000
expect with a standard abide which is

861
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:06,199
gold tender so uh it was working well

862
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,838
for controlling the weed the big thing

863
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:09,319
and I mention it because it's big

864
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:10,920
problem we still have to face with this

865
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,280
kind of equipment is that if you're

866
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,159
looking at the yield if you're looking

867
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,440
at the cage head weight clearly with

868
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:19,719
four passes of the O we had a

869
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,720
significant reduction in in head weight

870
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:24,519
on on the fact is that it's mostly

871
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,919
associated with damage mechanical damage

872
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:28,519
that you're getting when you keep

873
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,760
running this kind of equipment you don't

874
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:33,599
have enough even if we have rtk we still

875
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,320
uh we still eat basically the

876
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,400
transplanted cabage and we got

877
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,480
sufficient mechanical damage on the

878
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,599
cabage for causing a significant

879
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,480
reduction right here and we saw that

880
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:49,000
with the O only with also so it with a

881
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,480
prear aile plus um plus a robot uh with

882
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,280
it when we're using just prear we don't

883
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,519
see this kind of damage IA didn't damage

884
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:00,119
the

885
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:03,280
crop uh that's a trial that we oop sorry

886
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:05,240
that we did uh this year in sweet con uh

887
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,040
again I mean we were looking at pre-

888
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:09,358
only preemergence abde pre and

889
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,920
postemergence abide and we had two

890
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:14,480
frequencies of of use for the robot

891
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,000
equipment we had either bi-weekly uh

892
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,719
twice a month a weekly application and

893
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,039
when we're using weekly application of

894
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,679
the of the O we are getting the same

895
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,480
level of we controllers what we're

896
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:27,919
getting from a standard preasur and post

897
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,880
emance Abad application program we had

898
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,760
some week we that escaped the the Nao o

899
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,920
robot and essentially this one full

900
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:39,040
panicum even with heride it's it's hard

901
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,480
we to control uh and clearly as this one

902
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,239
because it's emerging late in the season

903
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,000
the O didn't do such a good job at

904
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,838
controlling this

905
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,358
one uh when you're looking at uh ear

906
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,880
weight on ear lens clearly I mean all

907
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:54,279
the application um if you're looking

908
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,760
right here at the weekly application of

909
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,720
the na o right here you have the same

910
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,280
ear weight as well you will get from a

911
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:04,719
standard Abad application program now if

912
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,920
you're getting a bi-weekly uh definitely

913
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,279
bi-weekly was not enough so clearly we

914
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,960
need to have a frequent almost yeah

915
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,960
weekly page of of this kind of

916
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,440
Technology if you want to get good with

917
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,920
control okay what is next with this one

918
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,400
um again we want to get more autonomy we

919
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,159
want to try to use uh new tools um that

920
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,039
we can integrate with this technology uh

921
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,480
especially there's two different type of

922
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,358
tool that I think will be interesting

923
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,159
for us Lyn mention it in the

924
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:35,519
introduction I do significant work

925
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:36,799
looking at cover cropping in veggies on

926
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,599
we have a hard time sometime

927
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,800
establishing our cover crop between the

928
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:43,200
row of veggies so we know that using

929
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,480
this kind of robot maybe something that

930
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,358
um if we are uh using it with a spreer

931
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,838
we can potentially start Sing cover

932
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:55,358
crops between uh Z rows of of of of in

933
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:57,679
of crops in plastic culture system the

934
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:02,358
other one is that right here you have a

935
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:03,799
um broccoli planted in in red clover and

936
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:05,519
sometime you have significant

937
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,280
competition between the cover crops the

938
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:09,880
red clover on the broccoli and we are

939
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,240
thinking that we had something for

940
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,318
mowing the red clover between the row we

941
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,959
will significantly reduce the level of

942
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:19,800
competition uh due to the cover crop so

943
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,079
we want to test potentially a mare for

944
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,680
reducing cover crop

945
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,039
competition all right let's move to

946
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:29,358
probably the most exciting ones which is

947
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:32,279
really the laser weer which is work that

948
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:34,838
ly and I did last year duplicated

949
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,599
between New Jersey on on on on on

950
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:40,440
Cornell New York

951
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,838
so um so we worked with Travis Parker

952
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,599
for carbon robot from carbon robotics

953
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:48,358
using this a laser weer platform um um

954
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:51,318
coming straight from

955
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:54,440
California so carbon robotics was funded

956
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:56,838
in 2018 and its headquarter in Cal

957
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,240
Washington the units are made in the US

958
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:01,400
in Detroit

959
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:04,759
uh on in 20 early 2022 carbon robotics

960
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:07,599
launched the laser Wier targeting large

961
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,640
vegetable grower States so Arizona

962
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,440
California New Mexico Oregon Washington

963
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,159
idah U so right now this technology has

964
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,400
been mostly developed on the west coast

965
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:19,838
not so much uh application not so much

966
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,000
testing on the East Coast so laser

967
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:25,480
readers are on farms in at least 17 us

968
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,079
States including New York now on three

969
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:31,240
provinces in Canada with expansion into

970
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,079
International markets to follow um so

971
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:37,279
the way it's working I mean what what we

972
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,480
got here for testing was is uh I would

973
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,760
call it the Research Unit that was their

974
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,838
protocol that was their prototype sorry

975
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,880
that they they planed to Commercial and

976
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:48,000
finally they evolve towards something

977
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,160
which is really attached to the Tractor

978
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,400
so that's the commercial units $1.6

979
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:56,920
million that's what you can see uh um in

980
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,559
California but some onion Growers here I

981
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,800
forgot the name the Tores uh got one

982
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,759
unit as well in new jerse so that's the

983
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,400
commercial unit which is working with

984
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,680
the tractor this one was initially uh

985
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:13,960
developed for fully autonomous uh laser

986
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:15,719
weeding and that's not the way the pur

987
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,679
okay they decided to get with something

988
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:19,358
which is really attached to the Tractor

989
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:20,838
so we end up getting this one for

990
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:23,279
experimentation this

991
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:25,920
year so the way it's

992
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,760
working um have a nice video right here

993
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,559
so you have Artificial Intelligence on

994
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,880
board uh which is I mean your projecting

995
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:36,358
light on the light will really help the

996
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,200
artificial intelligence discriminating

997
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:42,440
the crop on the weeds identifying the

998
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:45,719
weeds as to the crop on this system uh

999
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,760
is driving directing lasers and you can

1000
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:49,639
see some of them you can see some smoke

1001
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,720
right here and when you have we

1002
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:53,239
detection the laser are specifically

1003
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:57,480
targeting the wheat and burning the

1004
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:59,598
Wheats okay um yeah you see right yeah

1005
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,280
right in the middle uh it's impressive

1006
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,039
because you will see some picture it's

1007
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,319
not touching the crop so you really have

1008
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,800
excellent discrimination between the

1009
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:09,599
crops on the weeds and we got we didn't

1010
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,680
see any crop damage associated with the

1011
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,280
system so it's quite impressive to see

1012
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:17,759
uh just a picture of what it looks like

1013
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,119
uh when when you're using it the first

1014
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,920
thing you need to know is that you need

1015
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,760
to use it on small seedlings okay so

1016
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,079
it's something that yes you need to use

1017
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,720
really it's not a you need to look at

1018
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:30,519
your crop when you're using this system

1019
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,519
you need to know what is the size of

1020
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:34,519
your of your wids because that will

1021
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:36,719
determine the efficacy of the system so

1022
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:39,039
right here it's on brok you can see that

1023
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,399
all the we that I CLE circled in in

1024
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:43,880
yellow right here you can see the the

1025
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,639
burning of the green point on the weed

1026
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,640
so it's really targeting not the leaf

1027
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:49,559
it's targeting the growing point of the

1028
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:52,759
of the weed so it's really precise

1029
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:53,960
enough just to do that um on right here

1030
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,839
you didn't see any damage on the

1031
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,880
broccoli same thing right here looking

1032
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:00,400
at some of the P at that I planted in

1033
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,280
New Jersey you have the P right here I

1034
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,838
mean these we are extremely close to the

1035
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,359
p on the P was not damage now something

1036
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,480
which is interesting to consider too is

1037
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:13,078
that the system will give higher

1038
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,079
priority for contouring smaller weeds

1039
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:17,079
like this one okay why because

1040
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:18,839
controlling a big pig weed it's not so

1041
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:20,800
big but it's already big enough for

1042
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:22,960
controlling a pig readed like this one

1043
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,079
that really require too much energy for

1044
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,240
the system too much time spending on

1045
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,720
this one so they're giving priority to

1046
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:31,799
controlling the smaller weeds uh versus

1047
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:33,879
the bigger weeds with the bigger weeds I

1048
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,640
mean you can always send a small crew to

1049
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,880
just all on on remove some of these

1050
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:42,318
bigger

1051
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:44,800
weeds so we had a triol in New York on

1052
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,800
on New Jersey we look at different crops

1053
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,760
so we look at uh peas we look at spinach

1054
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:53,079
Lin look at beats as well um we had

1055
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,200
different uh treatment we had the of

1056
00:42:53,079 --> 00:43:00,160
course on Tred we check we had pre pre

1057
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:03,239
CDE in spin we had Post abde in PE in

1058
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:05,000
New Jersey um we had preab followed by

1059
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:07,399
laser reading and we had laser Reading

1060
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,599
Alone uh for for

1061
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,000
comparison so when you're looking at our

1062
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,960
pre P triol right here in New Jersey

1063
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,920
you're looking at the Weeden City 14

1064
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,880
days after the second laser weer pass so

1065
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,920
we did two laser two laser weer pass

1066
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,680
during the season you're looking right

1067
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,079
here at two different type of herbicide

1068
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:28,159
one which is a standard bentazone a

1069
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,680
period a that is not label but we wanted

1070
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,279
to use something different as well uh on

1071
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:34,039
you're looking right here at the carbon

1072
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,680
robotic in blue you have the laser

1073
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:39,519
reader the carbon robotic laser weer and

1074
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:41,358
clearly in term of weed density we had

1075
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:44,079
the same level of weed density as what

1076
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:46,078
you will expect from a the standard aide

1077
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,559
which is bentazone right here the weed

1078
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,559
free was cleaner of course because we

1079
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:52,720
were manually weeding the plots

1080
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,839
periodate not as much uh it's something

1081
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:57,719
that we are we're investigating it but

1082
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:59,599
not such a great control with his a side

1083
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:03,279
if you're looking at weed fresh biomass

1084
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:05,559
at Harvest again excellent uh efficacy

1085
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,519
of the laser weer I mean I was really

1086
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:09,839
mind blown by this type of application

1087
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:12,000
is that you just do two passes on it was

1088
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,880
sufficient to give you the same level of

1089
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,480
control of what you will get with the

1090
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,240
standard

1091
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:21,280
aide now if you're looking at uh yield

1092
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:23,879
we collected the crop fresh biomass at

1093
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,480
Harvest on clearly what was really

1094
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,200
interesting also to check right is that

1095
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,280
uh we got the same level of crop fresh

1096
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:34,639
biomass with a laser reader as compared

1097
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,599
to the wheat free and um that was not

1098
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,838
the case with bentazone even if we get

1099
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,119
good we control with bentazone this

1100
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:43,400
herbicide may still be causing damage to

1101
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:46,160
the crop and later it will translate

1102
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,280
into crop fresh biomass reduction so

1103
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:49,838
advantage of the laser weer right here

1104
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,200
is that yes you're getting the same

1105
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:53,599
level of weed control but you don't get

1106
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:55,239
herbicide injuries that may be

1107
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,039
associated with

1108
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:58,719
herbicide um and when you're looking

1109
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,800
looking at the yield yes I mean we had

1110
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:03,598
significant yield difference I mean the

1111
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,960
laser weer was at the same level of P

1112
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,559
yield as a wire check on what

1113
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,599
significantly higher than what we got

1114
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:12,160
with with

1115
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,920
herbicides uh looking at spinach weight

1116
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:17,358
control right here uh same thing looking

1117
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,400
at weat Fresh biomass at Harvest

1118
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:22,279
excellent control with the carbon

1119
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,599
robotics with a laser reader uh we don't

1120
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,720
have basically any weeds left over at

1121
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:28,119
the end of the season now when you're

1122
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,838
looking looking at the he weight what

1123
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:33,599
was interesting as well is that uh you

1124
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:35,558
had the same level of I mean this

1125
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,640
spinach was weighing as much as what you

1126
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:41,400
will get in the weat free but right here

1127
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:44,400
the dual herbicide plus the carbon

1128
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,318
robotic laser weer we had lower yield on

1129
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,079
this one and again that may be something

1130
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:50,000
that may be related to crop damage

1131
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,839
caused by the herbicide and actually

1132
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,239
that's something that Linn demonstrated

1133
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,159
here in New York where right here you

1134
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,159
have herbicide herbicide plus carbon

1135
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:00,719
Robotics and car Robotics and when

1136
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:03,078
you're looking at P at beats sorry on

1137
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,199
spinach we definitely have lower

1138
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:06,880
emergence where you have herbicide or

1139
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,078
herbicide plus carbon robotics plus

1140
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,800
laser weer because these herbicide may

1141
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:12,640
have significant effect on emergence of

1142
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,920
the crop so that's that's really

1143
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,719
something interesting you know with some

1144
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,599
things that we as we scientists are not

1145
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,358
documenting enough on that the kind of

1146
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,280
experimentation when you can start to to

1147
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:25,519
see that okay so that was similar

1148
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,480
experimentation the crop stunting again

1149
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:30,719
greater crop stunting in beats and

1150
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,960
spinach associated with the use of the

1151
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:36,358
herbicides so what's next for the laser

1152
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,800
weer uh we continue laser weer

1153
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:40,598
evaluation for early season using in

1154
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,200
crubs that can be sensitive to herbicide

1155
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:46,160
injury like beats and spinach I think

1156
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:50,558
for some high value specialty crops like

1157
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:52,279
in my case um uh basil that may be

1158
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,720
really something interesting to test we

1159
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:57,160
don't have any abide in basil very few

1160
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,639
abide very ineffective abide so using

1161
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:01,199
the laser Wier will be something

1162
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:02,960
interesting to do a brief Overlook at

1163
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:05,558
some other novel Technologies so I

1164
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,400
mentioned the farm engine Amiga so

1165
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:09,319
that's what they already did at clarel

1166
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,440
where they Associated the farm NG

1167
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:13,960
platform autonomous platform with a weed

1168
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,838
it sprayer so combining two of these

1169
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:20,000
Technologies together to get something

1170
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:21,920
fully autonomous um I will be working L

1171
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,358
will be working as well with a zaso zap

1172
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,200
reader which is using electricity I

1173
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:29,318
didn't develop it today because I didn't

1174
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:31,639
do it but did work with electricity but

1175
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:34,480
that's something that we want to use for

1176
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:38,440
um uh vegetable crops for example to get

1177
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:41,358
some smaller units for for prod research

1178
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:45,760
um we did some demonstration with

1179
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:48,639
autonomous U uh unit for weed control in

1180
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:52,280
grape um so you can see this one that's

1181
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:55,440
a naot fitted with finger wiers at the

1182
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:58,599
same time have some turning a f you see

1183
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,240
how f it goes autonomous controlling the

1184
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:03,400
weed you're walking the ground at the

1185
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:06,519
same time you're getting some training

1186
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,119
St uh that's something that we don't

1187
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:10,318
have on the EOS I don't think we'll get

1188
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,960
it anytime soon but that's the vcan

1189
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:15,279
autonomous weer where actually you have

1190
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:19,400
cameras on board that are detecting the

1191
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,559
crop on actuating some some fingers if

1192
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:25,639
you want for for King the weed between

1193
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:27,440
between the um you know in the crop so

1194
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:30,078
what did we learn so far

1195
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,400
um these technologies will does not

1196
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,920
necessarily eliminate the need for

1197
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:37,079
herbicide especially pre-emergence abde

1198
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,880
we still need some of these abide uh

1199
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:40,720
because they're not eliminating all the

1200
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,800
weeds you may still need to get manual

1201
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:45,399
labor for for controlling some of these

1202
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,960
weed some weeds will escape they're

1203
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,240
always escaping there will always be a

1204
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,639
place where the weed will escape so what

1205
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:53,838
selection pressure could we be impacting

1206
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:55,879
with this technology that's something

1207
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:59,480
that we don't know we know that for aide

1208
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:01,640
we don't know it so much for for um this

1209
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:04,119
kind of Technology uh not all

1210
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:06,440
alternative practices will be comp comp

1211
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:08,318
compatible with the new technology as I

1212
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,519
said I'm working with cover crop how

1213
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:13,719
does cover crop will fit using some of

1214
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:15,159
these new tools we don't know it yet uh

1215
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:16,919
but we really think that there's a role

1216
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:19,318
for this tool especially as companies

1217
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:22,159
are coming to the Northeast uh to test

1218
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:24,639
and modify their equipment U on again we

1219
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:27,798
cannot place all the eggs in the same

1220
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:29,279
basket last slide uh um there's many

1221
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,280
questions that we need to address before

1222
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,359
seeing full adoption of this technology

1223
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,680
the first one is the cost not just the

1224
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:38,639
cost of the unit uh the laser reader is

1225
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:40,598
costing $1.6 million but you also need

1226
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,759
to get additional Services okay you need

1227
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:45,798
to get GPS you need to get rtk you need

1228
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,200
to get Wi-Fi what about local support

1229
00:49:45,798 --> 00:49:50,119
this is very highend technology do we

1230
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:52,838
have the capacity locally to provide

1231
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:54,838
support for supporting this technology

1232
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:56,880
uh adaptability most of these

1233
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:58,759
technologies have been developed for the

1234
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,960
the West Coast okay different

1235
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,599
environment different soil different

1236
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,720
condition different growing condition so

1237
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:06,240
how does it fit on the East Coast I mean

1238
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,000
we have weeds that are emerging on a

1239
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:09,959
much more frequent basis than California

1240
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,119
for example we have much more rain so

1241
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,280
how does it fit for us on the on the

1242
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:16,880
East Coast uh infrastructure and

1243
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,400
Regulatory Readiness uh operation on

1244
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,960
safety of Transportation how do you

1245
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,358
transport some of these units how do you

1246
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,880
transport the laser wither here I mean

1247
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:25,639
is there any specific regulation that

1248
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,240
you need to use if I'm starting to talk

1249
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,440
to Rod g i using laser wheer the next

1250
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:30,879
thing I know is that I will have people

1251
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,838
from rodar telling me you have to be

1252
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,480
extremely careful can damage your eyes

1253
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:37,159
so you know you have all this kind of

1254
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,079
Regulation as well uh cellular service

1255
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:41,679
internet service base station so you

1256
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:43,519
have to get all these service available

1257
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:45,279
as well for using these new technology

1258
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:48,358
on changing the N the nature of the

1259
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,359
labor I mean this is highend technology

1260
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:52,679
and not many people have been trained so

1261
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:54,078
far for using this kind of technology

1262
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:55,759
and yes I mean we're living in

1263
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,720
communities where people are you know I

1264
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,280
mean wi management is something that in

1265
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:02,439
blueberry farm veggie Farm in New Jersey

1266
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,040
many people are still doing it manually

1267
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,559
what will these people do if we start

1268
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:09,440
getting this kind of Technology widely

1269
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:10,880
available so we need to start thinking

1270
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,318
to to that as

1271
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,760
well all right so future

1272
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:18,838
studies uh yes we'll be evaluating new

1273
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,760
autonomous robotic platform so I plan to

1274
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:24,000
work with a farm and jiga uh I will be

1275
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:29,799
working with electric reader we just

1276
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:31,838
order a zap um a zap reader from zaso uh

1277
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:33,599
I will be ordering well I order the XP

1278
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:36,078
Cofe weer and I will be using the zap

1279
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,000
reader as well uh we'll be continuing if

1280
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,960
possible the assment of laser weding in

1281
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,639
high value annual crops uh we are also

1282
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,880
planning we already did some work in

1283
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,279
cranberries looking at hyperspectral

1284
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,960
Imaging for we detection and I wanted to

1285
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,920
mention that uh Lena is a leading Pi on

1286
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,838
this one Bradon myself and other we

1287
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,639
scientist we receiv received a planning

1288
00:51:54,838 --> 00:51:59,239
s planning Grant in 2020 for for

1289
00:51:57,639 --> 00:52:02,598
identifying the novel technology

1290
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:04,759
adoption barriers on drivers uh by

1291
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:09,039
surveying stakeholders on the national

1292
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:11,440
basis so all right that's my funding and

1293
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:14,159
knowledgement over the last few years on

1294
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:18,679
yes the Dream the Dream

1295
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:18,679
Team well if you have a time for any

1296
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,359
question

1297
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:27,318
yes like in the CER Lakes area a lot of

1298
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:30,119
Vineyards will maintain

1299
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:33,199
undervine vegetation and I'm curious for

1300
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:35,400
the blueberry farmers in New Jersey is

1301
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:38,679
like the ideal weed management

1302
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:41,358
completely bare under the vines or is

1303
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:43,440
there room for some like competition or

1304
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:46,358
ground cover so the question is that

1305
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,400
yeah for blueberry can we get some weeds

1306
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:51,558
growing under the under the blueberry

1307
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,358
bushes okay can we toate that answer is

1308
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:56,240
no uh mostly because traditionally I

1309
00:52:54,358 --> 00:52:58,078
mean yes Growers don't want I mean our

1310
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:01,159
blue Growers don't want to see Wheats in

1311
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,760
the system uh it's also because as I

1312
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:05,480
mentioned we are growing blueberries in

1313
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:09,599
Sundy soil with really low water

1314
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:12,400
retention capacity on you may have weeds

1315
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,280
competing if you have a dryer quickly

1316
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,358
enough you will see the blueberry bushes

1317
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,480
uh dying I've seen picture from a

1318
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:23,318
drought maybe 20 years ago where that

1319
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:26,000
such highweed competitions as the

1320
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:27,318
blueberry bushes were dying because yes

1321
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,239
I mean this

1322
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:31,880
the the water you're providing even with

1323
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:33,879
drip irrigation will be benefiting the

1324
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,798
Wheats will even not be absorbed by by

1325
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,480
the crop so I would say depends on the

1326
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:40,199
nature of the soil you may have soil

1327
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,240
here where you have higher retention

1328
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:45,639
capacity for us in in blueberry Sundy

1329
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:47,759
Sundy soil so water is penetrating

1330
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:49,920
through the so very quickly on low

1331
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,880
organic matter content I mentioned that

1332
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,039
we do a lot of cultivation which I think

1333
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,000
we need to change because cultivating

1334
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:59,838
the ground is just

1335
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,559
deating the organic matter over time so

1336
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:04,279
if you're combining both definitely we

1337
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:05,920
have salt that cannot keep the moisture

1338
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,720
actually we're working have a project

1339
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,559
where we are working trying to uh change

1340
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:14,039
things by growing cover crops uh between

1341
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:15,920
rows of of blueberries uh the big

1342
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:18,480
challenges is that again you're working

1343
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,000
on acidic well on sunndy soil so you

1344
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,599
don't have so many cover crops that can

1345
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,798
fit in this kind of condition on you're

1346
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:28,720
working on salt pH which is 4.5 so many

1347
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:31,400
many cover crop will not just grow well

1348
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:33,598
under this condition okay so that's that

1349
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,639
may be

1350
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,240
challenging yes sir if the Machinery is

1351
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:40,679
so expensive how do kind of small

1352
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:44,479
farmers and

1353
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:47,199
communities afford it is that like a

1354
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,880
rental the cost of the technology that's

1355
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:52,159
a good question I I think right now yes

1356
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:54,920
I mean you see adoption of some of these

1357
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:56,558
big Technologies by by big farms and

1358
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,639
truthfully I think that for us New

1359
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,400
Jersey and probably as well in New York

1360
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,400
as a smaller farm that don't have the

1361
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,000
capacity right now to adopt this

1362
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,599
technology as a farm maybe they start to

1363
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,239
come together maybe they can provide

1364
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:13,760
sufficient funding for that um I see two

1365
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:15,959
things I mean not every crop will be

1366
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,760
used for will be useful for this kind of

1367
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:21,358
Technology uh doing the laser Wier let's

1368
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:24,160
say in squash production you don't make

1369
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:27,038
enough money there's not enough profit

1370
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:29,038
profitability in squash production for

1371
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:31,240
adopting this kind of highend

1372
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,839
Technologies now the thing that may

1373
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:34,279
happen too is that over the years I mean

1374
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:36,759
this kind of Technology will keep

1375
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,640
evolving and I expect that within the

1376
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:41,359
next 10 years we'll see we'll start to

1377
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:43,318
see smaller units that can start to be

1378
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:46,000
affordable for smaller Farm like we have

1379
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:47,558
on the East Coast on its yes I mean

1380
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,599
again this system has been fully

1381
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:53,079
developed for giant farming operation in

1382
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:54,960
California uh we are coming here they

1383
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:56,920
are coming here to see us and clearly

1384
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,440
yes I mean maybe a few big farm can

1385
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,358
adopt it on the East Coast but the

1386
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,240
majority of the smaller Farm they don't

1387
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:04,078
have the capacity of doing that but I

1388
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:05,959
mean if you're looking at yes I mean

1389
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,960
that's the case for laser weer if you're

1390
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:14,039
looking at the the Nao o robot that I

1391
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:17,240
was showing it's 70,000 bucks so you can

1392
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:19,280
have small organic farming operation a

1393
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:20,558
very small farm where they can start

1394
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,640
considering buying this kind of

1395
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,079
Technology because yes I mean it's it's

1396
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:26,318
effective for weight control it can be

1397
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,440
really effective I mean you have a steep

1398
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:30,519
learning curve with some of this

1399
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,480
technology the Nao o uh I show you the

1400
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:34,480
slide where actually you have good we

1401
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,400
control but you're getting so much crop

1402
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,400
damage that you know I mean it's you

1403
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,519
need to learn to use this tool as well

1404
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,000
and to make sure that maybe you can thr

1405
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:46,199
it a little bit of crop

1406
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,039
competition if you know if you don't get

1407
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:51,118
too many crop damage at the same time

1408
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,559
you want to mention like the the Amiga

1409
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:56,960
the cost of the Amiga oh and like the

1410
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:59,519
out oh you boot it so you can

1411
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:03,240
so um so Terry was saying yeah the the

1412
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:05,239
laser weeder is definitely um an outlier

1413
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:07,558
uh but we do have two units in New York

1414
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:09,598
and we have two more ordered by growers

1415
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:12,920
in New York um there are some very high

1416
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:16,680
value large Farms um but like the amga I

1417
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:20,039
think the Amiga ran runs about 15,000 so

1418
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:21,919
it starts to enter a range where it does

1419
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:24,760
become more affordable there is then

1420
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,599
there are um companies that are are

1421
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:29,520
building smaller more affordable units

1422
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:32,280
and there's also there are some people

1423
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:36,079
who have a push for open uh open source

1424
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:38,359
systems uh guy Coleman out of Australia

1425
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,318
it has built an open weed locator which

1426
00:57:38,358 --> 00:57:43,038
is basically an open source Vision

1427
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,159
guided system you know and uh I think

1428
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,240
that runs about $400 but you're just

1429
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:49,920
going to have to be extremely talented

1430
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:52,399
with like building it um you know

1431
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,880
building your own spray system but there

1432
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,720
there is kind of this potential to uh to

1433
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,920
min

1434
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:01,679
the the cost and as Terry said uh more

1435
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,280
companies are entering the market even

1436
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:07,480
in the laser weer Market uh using

1437
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:10,400
different lasers and so the cost is

1438
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,798
expected to to drop the thing to when

1439
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,400
you are talking about the cost that you

1440
00:58:11,798 --> 00:58:16,719
have the cost of equipment but you need

1441
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,920
to get all you know this technology it's

1442
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:22,759
not just putting fuel in it you need to

1443
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:26,400
get access to rtk you need to get access

1444
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:29,319
to GPS you need in some case to get bu

1445
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:32,079
base station for thega for example you

1446
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:35,440
need to get these other services as well

1447
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:38,240
that sometime maybe you know may not be

1448
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,519
available um New Jersey in the Pine Bar

1449
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:42,399
I don't have Wi-Fi I don't have I don't

1450
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:43,838
have a good cell phone service so if I

1451
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,720
don't have it on my own cell phone I

1452
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:48,318
know that this kind of system will not

1453
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:51,038
be working as well uh too so that's

1454
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:53,880
something to consider too so there I I

1455
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:55,839
think we'll be there at some point but

1456
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,640
the thing to I mean I didn't mention it

1457
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:59,480
that many of these

1458
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:02,519
Technologies they are excellent

1459
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:04,480
Engineers they are not plant biologist

1460
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:06,079
okay these guys think that they're

1461
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,039
coming with new equipment it will be

1462
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:10,200
wonderful it will be working great under

1463
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:12,160
the East condition they don't know what

1464
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:14,558
other the condition they they have a

1465
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:16,038
tendency it's changing but have tendency

1466
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,880
working as a company and they don't

1467
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:20,760
always come to see us University

1468
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:24,000
extension people uh it's starting to

1469
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:26,720
change okay we saw that last year uh but

1470
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,798
initially it was mostly driven by engine

1471
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:32,439
on they may not have the focus on a

1472
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:35,519
cropping system on weed management you

1473
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,159
know on weed ecology weed biology they

1474
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:38,759
may not be familiar with that and it's

1475
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:40,759
something that you need to integrate

1476
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,760
especially here on the East Coast

1477
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,359
because well our condition I mean

1478
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,960
California it's easy you don't have rain

1479
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:49,880
if you don't have rain you don't have

1480
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,880
wheat here it's it's a different

1481
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:54,318
challenge yep you notice the laser weer

1482
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,119
did you notice a difference in

1483
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:59,920
performance when it was weeding annual

1484
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:01,798
versus so we didn't see the difference

1485
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,358
because we didn't have

1486
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:08,038
prols oh yes we have not said you have

1487
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:10,400
you had nut Edge I didn't have nuts Edge

1488
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:11,680
so Linn can talk about the nut Edge but

1489
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,000
that that's something that yes

1490
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:16,279
definitely is interesting to check

1491
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,119
because uh you may make the assumption

1492
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:21,119
that the nut said you know it's a tuber

1493
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:24,000
so you can kill the one which is aerg

1494
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,480
but you still have uh spruing that may

1495
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,119
be coming from from the tuers so

1496
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,679
uh I don't know I mean did we see

1497
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:33,640
something on this one yeah we had we had

1498
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:37,118
regrowth of of nuts Edge we we we killed

1499
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:38,960
some small ones but um this is this is

1500
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:42,160
the whole what do we leave behind who

1501
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,519
wins and perennials are going to be no

1502
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:46,358
matter what system we hear perennials

1503
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:49,239
are probably gonna rise to the top of

1504
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:51,679
the winter I think for nut Edge because

1505
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:53,118
we're working on anal crops nuts Edge

1506
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:54,960
what will be important is that if you're

1507
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:58,119
looking at the Ecology of nuts Edge at

1508
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:01,960
some point during the SE on Mid July the

1509
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:05,480
nuts Edge will turn to our production of

1510
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:07,960
new nuts new tubers for next year

1511
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,798
instead of producing new shoots so in

1512
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,720
term of we competition if you can get

1513
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:14,719
the nut Edge at least under control up

1514
01:01:11,719 --> 01:01:16,679
to Mid July we tend to see that you know

1515
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:20,798
you will be good because basically you

1516
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:23,519
don't have many uh clonal population uh

1517
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:24,960
coming from the from from the nuts so I

1518
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:27,358
think that's something that yes I mean

1519
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,318
you may still get Reg grow but at least

1520
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:31,358
you will not get the giant you know

1521
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:35,279
clonal patches of nut Ed that you can

1522
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:35,279
get if you leave it uh

1523
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:42,000
uncontrolled yes what do you think about

1524
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:43,920
the application of either the lasers or

1525
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,440
some of the other Tech in more of

1526
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,760
ergonomics setting with large scale oh

1527
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,639
that's a question for

1528
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:56,240
people uh I mean I that's a good

1529
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:58,879
question I don't know for I I think for

1530
01:01:56,239 --> 01:02:01,118
the laser weer on vipan tell me if you

1531
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,838
know you think otherwise I think the the

1532
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:06,039
laser weer is really well adapted for

1533
01:02:02,838 --> 01:02:10,318
specialty crops uh because also high

1534
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:12,760
value crops uh do you make enough money

1535
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:14,880
do you need you know many of these

1536
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,440
agronomic crops I mean they still have a

1537
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,079
huge diversity of herbicides that they

1538
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:22,318
can use they are not as limited as what

1539
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,839
we are in specialty crops so they may

1540
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:26,480
not have the same need for laser weeding

1541
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:28,480
than we have in special

1542
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,880
but what they have in in in agronomic

1543
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,480
crops the targeted application that I

1544
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,278
was mentioning before Blue River for

1545
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,199
example they have this kind of targeted

1546
01:02:35,278 --> 01:02:38,960
application where clearly they will

1547
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:42,798
still rely on herbicide but they will

1548
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:44,798
really you know rely on lower rate of

1549
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:46,159
herbicide because of more precise

1550
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:48,159
application of the

1551
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:49,480
herbicide but I I don't think I don't

1552
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:51,759
know thean but I don't think that the

1553
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,760
laser weer it's not something which is

1554
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:58,079
explored for agronomic crops I I don't

1555
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:01,880
think so and it all depends on the cost

1556
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:04,480
of the technology right and the value of

1557
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:06,760
the crop are high value crops where you

1558
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,358
can spend and a half million

1559
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:12,278
dollar but so I mean we

1560
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:14,119
folks four bus five

1561
01:03:12,278 --> 01:03:17,760
bus there's a

1562
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:20,160
lot they they have more to other

1563
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:23,200
to which which is still working the

1564
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:25,318
laser weer is also much slower than if

1565
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,598
you went to Blue River talk last week

1566
01:03:25,318 --> 01:03:29,838
they were going what 10 miles an hour 12

1567
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,599
mil 12 miles an hour the laser meter is

1568
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:35,358
not doing that 1.5 they can't cover the

1569
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:39,680
Acres right but

1570
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:42,278
uh leafy greens that can cover

1571
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:45,199
yes going going into the future that

1572
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:46,920
this is the future maybe maybe in the

1573
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:49,038
future we'll see units that can go

1574
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,880
faster as well all right I want to thank

1575
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:53,680
everybody for coming for The Graduate

1576
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,920
students here there is a lunch provided

1577
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:59,399
uh with Dr Boson

1578
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:03,000
in 413 yes thank

1579
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:05,119
you thank you all and um if you have

1580
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,880
questions for Terry you can reach out to

1581
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,480
him via email you can uh get in touch

1582
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:12,680
with me I can put you in touch with him

1583
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,480
uh thank you so much Terry and we are

1584
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:18,358
looking forward uh to 2025 we are

1585
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:21,079
already planning the project it's gonna

1586
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:21,078
we think it's getting

1587
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:30,160
exciting this this has been a production

1588
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:33,160
of Cornell University on the web at

1589
