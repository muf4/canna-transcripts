1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,440
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:12,798
University yeah I will talk about um

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,759
tree selection and hopefully I will end

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,679
this presentation within the time

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,359
otherwise we we see

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:22,480
what we'll do uh I will start to try to

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,840
explain what I mean with improving or

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,000
Urban resilience when it comes to tree

9
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,320
selection because

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
today the urban habitat or the last

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,799
decades or so the urban green

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,280
infrastructure have been identified as a

13
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:43,599
very important element in order to

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,399
create the resilience to both current

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,160
happenings but also future happenings

16
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,399
like climate change but also new

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,159
functions we given more and more people

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,399
in urban areas and more pressure to

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,558
urban areas and the green infrastructure

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,198
have been identified as one of the most

21
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,839
important elements in order to meet

22
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:04,000
these changes and new demands for urban

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,719
environments uh and when you look at the

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,438
green infrastructure goes from

25
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:10,118
everything from the cut lawn to

26
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,199
Shrubbery to pocket Woodlands Street

27
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:16,200
trees green roof green Walls even the

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,400
pots on a balcony all these together is

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,840
recognized as a green infrastructure but

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,680
when you look at the plants which

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,719
individual plants and Plantation that

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,200
they have the the biggest impact trees

33
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,879
is outstanding when it comes to

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,478
delivering different kind of services

35
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:34,478
and function and we talk about this

36
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:36,118
ecosystem services that trees can be

37
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,039
delivering from Urban environments in

38
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:41,359
order to create resilience and so on and

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,040
this is just a compilation by Johanna in

40
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:47,478
her thesis and I just stole it it's

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,680
easier to steal stuff that's how we do I

42
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:51,879
just stole it but it shows really good

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,040
what trees and urban uh the green

44
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:57,839
infrastructure can deliver and the most

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,479
things you hear about is this regulating

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,478
ecosystem service like storm water

47
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,280
management

48
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,200
microclimate mitigation pollution relief

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,399
and so on but there are also others

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,120
function like cultural provision

51
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:14,120
supporting uh ecosystem Services as well

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,599
where trees can and have the capacity to

53
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,719
deliver a great share all this together

54
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,079
because when we come to Urban

55
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,959
environments today the spaces where is

56
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,640
allowed for a tree planting or

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,519
Plantation it get fewer and fewer so the

58
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:30,359
few places where you allowed to plant

59
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,959
trees this Plantation is not only to be

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,400
a good-look space to create a local

61
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,239
identity for the place is equally

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,640
important to serve many kind of function

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,319
so that's why tree selection is really

64
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,679
really crucial when it comes to create a

65
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:49,479
resilient in urban

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,319
environment however and also this that

67
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:55,679
the capacity for the trees to deliver a

68
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:58,238
function increased by space and

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,599
condition so well- growing

70
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,840
trees large trees of course deliver or

71
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:08,199
have the higher capacity to deliver this

72
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,400
function so therefore the thing we plant

73
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:13,518
here have to reach to this in order to

74
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,360
create this resilience and so on so what

75
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,719
we are doing the plant selection is

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,760
really really important and that

77
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:23,039
includes for of course site preparation

78
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,199
by good imp plant environment but also

79
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,039
the plant selection that's why we focus

80
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,798
on this speaks in a

81
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:33,079
way and this is actually how it looks

82
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,200
many times this is actually a plant uh

83
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,280
this is um a parking

84
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,759
space uh in the southern Sweden this is

85
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,519
it looks worse than it is actually this

86
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:46,120
is a um a space where water can go

87
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,158
through and it's a structural soil here

88
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,599
so the main idea here was that this

89
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,759
Plantation should mitigate the urban

90
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:55,119
heat island effect by shading the space

91
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,959
but also shading the cars so the dogs

92
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,319
and people in the cars don't die

93
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,360
directly it take some time but Al the

94
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,399
space is part of the local uh storm

95
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,079
water managements in order to mitigate

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,680
that as well so it is good but what the

97
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,840
problem is here is completely wrong

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,159
plant material they're selecting they're

99
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,798
selecting a suore maple a maple tree

100
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:20,159
that needs moist condition more or less

101
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:22,439
all throughout the season and even if

102
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,439
this is a good space the situation will

103
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,959
not give that so the plant selection

104
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:28,519
completely wrong here so you completely

105
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,560
fail and it cost a lot of money with

106
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,038
doing that and this is not

107
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,399
situation in southern Sweden you can see

108
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,599
it both there in Nia New York City all

109
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,239
over the world where plant selection is

110
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,879
completely wrong for site and we have to

111
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,240
because it cost a lot of money to

112
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,240
replace this and also producing trees

113
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,720
are going to die and so on it's just

114
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,199
stupid so we have to increase our

115
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,759
knowledge about uh plant selection so

116
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,240
that's one side of the cone when coin

117
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,000
when it comes to plant selection the

118
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,120
other ones is this there is a lack of

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,918
diversity within Urban areas this is a

120
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,160
study we did a couple years ago in

121
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:08,279
Scandinavia when we evaluated the Urban

122
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,800
Tree population in Denmark Finland

123
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,638
Norway and Sweden and this is the street

124
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,400
environment in Helsinki you know this

125
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,360
Capital Finland Oslo capital of Norway

126
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,120
and you can see it's just few species

127
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,960
that stand for the dominance and if a

128
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,038
disease hits one of these Oslo risk to

129
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,519
uh lose most uh

130
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:33,639
44.3% of the street in just over a year

131
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,359
maybe and then you lose the resilience

132
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,680
for that and it takes many many years in

133
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
order to build that up again and this is

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,600
not a

135
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,520
Scandinavian problem only this is an

136
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,600
international problem problem this is

137
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,680
from a study we are working on when we

138
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,120
try to evaluate the tree diversity in

139
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,000
urban areas around the world in the

140
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,918
Northern Hemisphere and this is Street

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,759
environment as well you see Pittsburgh

142
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,959
four species stand for more than half of

143
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,160
the population Beijing China three

144
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,758
species Camden which is the borrow in

145
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,599
central London UK four species Spain

146
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,319
three species stand for so this is

147
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:11,360
a a situation we have around the world

148
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,639
where there is a lack of

149
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,479
diversity and you can't say lack of

150
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,918
diversity in resil in the same sentence

151
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:20,199
it's not possible it's not it's not

152
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,680
going so what we standing in front of

153
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,639
the two M main challenges we standing in

154
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,959
front of is first increased knowledge

155
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,840
about untraditional or rare tree species

156
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,318
in order to introduce a wider diversity

157
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,318
of urban

158
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:40,478
trees but secondly start to understand

159
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:43,478
or start to develop knowledge about

160
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:46,758
their capacity this new UN traditional

161
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:49,399
plant materials in order to grow on

162
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,840
really challenging growing condition but

163
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,279
also their capacity to deliver different

164
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,839
kind of ecosystem services so these are

165
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,478
the two challenges we stand in front of

166
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,000
today and the work we are doing they

167
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,000
have done for many years but what we're

168
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,038
doing here in Corell and we probably

169
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,639
going to continue forever and ever

170
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:09,759
anyway so this is one I this is just an

171
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,960
introduction I like to talk about

172
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,639
so developing sight related knowledge

173
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,239
this is what Nina said learning from

174
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,120
nature because in nature trees and

175
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,960
plants generally have developed

176
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,160
different kind of traits and strategies

177
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,359
or even Personalities in order to

178
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,240
compete for resources in order to

179
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,160
compete for or tolerate different kind

180
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,639
of climates and grow condition so by

181
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,080
developing knowledge about which kind of

182
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,280
traits species have it's easy to find

183
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,279
their use potential also in urban

184
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,679
environment so this is not rocket

185
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:47,559
science pretty common sense because in

186
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,360
nature there is plants like this plants

187
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,000
that can take more or less everything

188
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,800
they have a lot of different kind of

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,918
superpower plants that can take a punch

190
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,879
or two and still be standing I have a

191
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:01,439
quote here here I really like this is

192
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:03,439
Mike Tyson everybody has a plan until

193
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,519
they get punched in the

194
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,719
face and this is really good because

195
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,839
this is what it's all about some have a

196
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,599
plan how to take this punch and still be

197
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:17,679
good-looking still be standing still be

198
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:20,759
performing well but they are plants they

199
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,079
don't have any sorry in the case of Mike

200
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,560
tyon or until they get bitten in the ear

201
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:30,758
exactly and then there are plants which

202
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:34,240
are stupid or maybe not that clever

203
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:36,200
that have developed less different and

204
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,320
can't take many punches even if this

205
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,719
person probably deserve many punches in

206
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,760
the face

207
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,720
anyway when it comes to plant selection

208
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,080
it's

209
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,879
important to start to

210
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,839
know how well they can take or which

211
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,639
kind of superpowers or personality

212
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,320
plants have which kind of strategies or

213
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,919
traits to have but also how welld

214
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,560
developed these different traits

215
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:06,039
are and in urban environment there is a

216
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:08,439
lot of stress factors that affect the

217
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:11,240
trees and one of the main stress factors

218
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,800
that trees is facing today will probably

219
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,919
face even more in the future climate is

220
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:19,278
lack of water so water stress is the

221
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,199
main Contra trees in urban

222
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,879
environments because the urban

223
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,000
environment is a more warmer climate

224
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:28,399
with a more effective e evapo

225
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,078
transpiration but also you have a very

226
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,879
effective water Runner all these hard

227
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:36,519
surfaces but also the space for many

228
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:39,120
trees especially below ground is limited

229
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,799
because of space of pipes and other

230
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,639
things in this

231
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,078
multifunctional place as Urban

232
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:48,199
environments represent today so what

233
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,639
we're focusing is drought stress for

234
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,120
trees and see what kind of superpowers

235
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,720
they have in order to deal with what uh

236
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,679
and this is um a compilation by our

237
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,440
colleagues Andrew irons from my school

238
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:04,278
college that did this for a couple years

239
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,000
back where he tried to put

240
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:08,879
together how trees dealing with water

241
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,039
stress and you can see that you can

242
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:16,039
divide them in two groups avoiding water

243
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,439
stress and then second is just take the

244
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:21,000
water stress and tolerate it and I will

245
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:25,800
start with avoidance the tree how how

246
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,320
trees can avoid um water stress and then

247
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:31,240
you can have two subcategories like

248
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,200
maximizing water this is a hard word for

249
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,159
me acquisation is that good acquisition

250
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,639
yeah can you say it acquisition there

251
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,958
you go I can't say

252
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,680
it and that's of course that's the main

253
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:47,239
thing is to invest in a root system that

254
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:49,399
can support a tree with water that's the

255
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,959
main avoiding strategy that most of the

256
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,480
plants do some are better some are

257
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:56,518
weaker but then we have this one reduce

258
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:01,079
water use or would reduce water

259
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:04,560
loss by for example stoo tomato closure

260
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:06,439
reduce leaf and stem growths um they're

261
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:11,239
investing in pession of leaf thicker

262
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:14,519
Cula but also this one which is less

263
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,200
attractive so to say just throwing the

264
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,320
leaves this is a a picture from a close

265
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,560
to our summerhouse in southern Sweden in

266
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,879
a place where you have a thin soil layer

267
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:25,559
we have rocks and just half a meter soil

268
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,240
after a couple of weeks really warm and

269
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:31,039
dry weather the root system can't

270
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,680
support the tree with water anymore and

271
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:36,719
some trees don't have any second plan of

272
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,759
Plan B they just just rely on tree roots

273
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,480
when the tree roots fail they have no

274
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,399
idea how to deal with the situation so

275
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,800
they go into panic and you can see

276
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,519
what's happening just throwing the

277
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:50,519
leaves in order to reduce the water loss

278
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,959
a very effective way you can see are

279
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,000
many species this is the

280
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,159
burges Betula pendula in Sweden but you

281
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,919
can also see it like this this is from

282
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,759
the plantation here at Cornell even if

283
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:04,399
you have a structure soil here which is

284
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,639
better than normal it's better than it

285
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,879
look like these trees this is from

286
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,240
August uh four years

287
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:14,480
ago when they're panicking they they

288
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,399
just have no idea what to do the root

289
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
say the root calls the tree Crown we

290
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,159
have we don't have any water down here

291
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,078
so they go into panic and don't want to

292
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,039
lose anything and throw the leaves you

293
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,799
can compare to the trees here plant at

294
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:28,719
the same time and they have more or less

295
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,319
an unlimited rooting space and they

296
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,639
still and doing well so this is an

297
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,720
example of avoidance strategy avoiding

298
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,959
when it comes to rules but there's other

299
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,120
example of avoidance strategies for

300
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,958
example this I think I showed you this

301
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,240
last year when I have to speak this is a

302
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:48,039
silver lime silver Linden all these

303
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,120
American names of tree I'm very sorry

304
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:54,078
about that Tia tomosa this is a picture

305
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,839
from mavia Republic of mavia but they

306
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,039
they also invest in a root system of

307
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,760
course in order to avoid but they also

308
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,639
invested other tools for for example

309
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,480
pesan leaves and they invest in a

310
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:07,560
special pesan or hair type which is this

311
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,879
Star Hair which is like small micro

312
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:14,399
umbrellas which cover the can you say

313
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:17,519
underside of leaf or is that okay thank

314
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,879
you UND side sorry about it underside of

315
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,440
the leaf which reduce the loss of water

316
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,519
so that that's another avoidance

317
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,160
strategies the silver Lindon use and the

318
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,039
silver have another level of avoidance

319
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,120
strategy this is an interesting Forest

320
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:36,360
just on the border between Romania and

321
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,879
Republic of um of um mavia you have to

322
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,519
bring your passport when you go into

323
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,078
this Forest because you never know which

324
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,360
country you're going to end in i I've

325
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:46,759
done that mistake a couple of times but

326
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,480
here you can say the silver Lindon in

327
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:52,480
the Oak Forest and this is a very warm

328
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,440
warm and dry day and you can see also in

329
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,839
the plantation here that a warm day the

330
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,680
silver Linden is more silver compared to

331
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:02,480
a moist and cool day because on a warm

332
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:05,078
day they turn the leaf upside to the sky

333
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,560
and by doing there that theyed they they

334
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:09,879
reflect away some of the sunlight which

335
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,559
makes the leaf doesn't heat up in the

336
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,799
same amount as normal and if the leaf

337
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,119
doesn't warm up that much they don't

338
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,758
have to use a lot of water to cool down

339
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,120
the leaf there's a very clever way to in

340
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,079
a warm day reduce water loss by

341
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,120
reflecting away the sunlight and doesn't

342
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,638
get that up heated so to say so that's

343
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,278
that's

344
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,039
a

345
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:38,039
um that's some example of avoiding

346
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,319
strategy trees have in order so by

347
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,519
that's what part of the research we're

348
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,519
doing try to identify all these types of

349
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,560
strategies avoidance strategy trees have

350
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,720
and also try to understand how good they

351
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,919
are root system of course is good but

352
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,560
when the root system or in the soil

353
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:56,719
dries up what kind of other plans do you

354
00:14:54,559 --> 00:15:00,000
have in order to step up and take the

355
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,000
drought so to say

356
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,519
but the thing is same picture again same

357
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,679
situation very dry but there are trees

358
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,560
that have the same lack of water in the

359
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:13,319
soil the root system failed to support

360
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:16,719
the tree but the tree doing well

361
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,000
anyway so this is an interesting

362
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,720
strategy we are looking at we have been

363
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,879
looking a little bit extra to this

364
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,560
tolerance that's taking the punch so to

365
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:30,240
say and still be standing well and

366
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:33,318
looking good to take the drought in in

367
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,759
order to avoid it so to

368
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:39,799
say because when it comes to tolerance

369
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,919
of water uh uh water or limited water

370
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:44,479
availability there are several different

371
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,838
kind of strategy that trees have

372
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,600
developed osmotic adjustment for example

373
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,600
elastic adjustment but also low low

374
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,199
turgo loss point which have been a

375
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,560
special interest for us because that if

376
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,758
you have a very low turgo loss point you

377
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,599
have the potential to just shut up just

378
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,519
to stand there take the punches and wait

379
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,159
out the drought and then when the rain

380
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,240
weather comes it

381
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:13,559
just goes on business as usual so that's

382
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,600
the interesting to see how much you can

383
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:18,159
shut up and how long you can do it so

384
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,759
that's why three three years ago we

385
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,278
started a project together which is a

386
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,839
collaboration between the Swedish

387
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:27,958
Agriculture University Cornell with Nina

388
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,440
but also with mycope college in UK with

389
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,198
Dr Andrew irons

390
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,360
and we call the project shut the hell up

391
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,120
or die which actually what it's all

392
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,039
about try

393
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,039
to see how much a tree can or why they

394
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,120
can standing there and just shut the

395
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,719
hell up but also see how long you can

396
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,720
take it how long how many punches you

397
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,720
can take because that's important to see

398
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,680
in situation where you need to have

399
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,680
trees that can standing and taking the

400
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,359
punch of the punch and still looking

401
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:59,120
good and deliver different so low turgo

402
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,480
loss points we thought that was

403
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,359
interesting to look at and tuross point

404
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,880
can be used as a universal measure of

405
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,399
physiological drought tolerance that is

406
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,439
quantifi and

407
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,519
measurable and this is very attractive

408
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,519
for me rank species in terms of their

409
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:16,400
physiological drought tolerance because

410
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:20,078
today when you rev your literature he

411
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:23,199
stand it's tolerant for Drought yeah but

412
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:27,078
how much drought that's the problem we

413
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,960
can't say this is better than other ones

414
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:30,839
and that's very attractive that if it's

415
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,720
possible to rank Spees actually give a

416
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:36,038
number to actually say this is drought T

417
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,480
this much and this is actually this much

418
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:41,079
then it's easier to pinpoint which

419
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,120
species that can be used on that site

420
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:45,678
because in that site you have to take

421
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:48,558
the drought this much and so on but the

422
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,000
problem before is that taking uh to

423
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:54,839
measuring the turgo loss point is a very

424
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,839
complicated time

425
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:00,759
um sorry consuming time consuming thank

426
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,720
thank

427
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:06,679
you can you read

428
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,720
mines it's good time consuming work

429
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:10,559
which means that maybe for a year you

430
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,159
work with four or five species and you

431
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:16,399
can take the tuross point for them and

432
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:18,240
that's it but when it comes to diversity

433
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,240
we have to look at a large share of

434
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,798
species to in order to see the potential

435
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,440
of which one can be introduced or uh to

436
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:29,240
for nurseries or Landscape Architects

437
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,480
tree planners and so on but the last

438
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,440
three years or four years ago a group in

439
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,440
in China together with people in

440
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,360
California come up with that there is a

441
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,080
close relationship between osmotic

442
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:43,119
adjustment and turgo loss point and that

443
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:46,599
makes it possible in a much easier way

444
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:49,839
to to develop or to take out the turgo L

445
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:52,199
point we can use um another methology

446
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:55,119
but also it's possible uh with new

447
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,960
techniques to use it more easy that

448
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:00,038
makes it possible to take tur to to

449
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,319
create turgo loss point in a much easier

450
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:05,440
way and faster way so last year we spent

451
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:08,119
more or less a whole year to just

452
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,519
adjusting this uh methology testing back

453
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:12,839
and forward because the the work that

454
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:14,480
had been done before have been developed

455
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,240
for subtropical tropical and

456
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,240
Mediterranean plant species and we are

457
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,120
not there we are working in temperate

458
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,759
zone so that's why we're testing back

459
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:27,719
and forward so the result last year have

460
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:29,359
been actually published or accepted for

461
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,360
publication so it's going to be

462
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:35,000
published anytime here and we was

463
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:39,479
looking at Maples 27 different species

464
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,240
and genotype of Maples um we tested last

465
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,000
year when it comes to turgo loss points

466
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,279
and this is what's I thought it was

467
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,640
interesting to actually do some kind of

468
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,639
ranking but also you can see because the

469
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,679
more negative pressure you can take the

470
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,640
longer you can shut up longer you can

471
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,159
take the drought after the root system

472
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,120
all this avoid

473
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,880
strategies fail then you can take a

474
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:07,918
longer drought before because turgo loss

475
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:12,320
point if if I should explain it is that

476
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:16,960
when the root system fail to um deliver

477
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:19,798
water you go into a wilting uh position

478
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,000
so the cell structuring leaves just

479
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:25,960
shrinking and they can shrink to a

480
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,240
special level and then it just implodes

481
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,240
and then the cell structure just gone

482
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,240
the in M the trees have done for that

483
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,159
Lea everything is gone they can't

484
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,759
produce any photo or any photosynthesis

485
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:40,919
anymore but this level before the cell

486
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,200
structure just implode and destroyed

487
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,960
different between different species so

488
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,919
some species can take just three or four

489
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,840
days of drought and then the cell

490
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:52,159
structure just goes out but some they

491
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:55,639
have a very strong cell walls and so on

492
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,799
so they can take a long cells uh very

493
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,038
what say very low negative pressure

494
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:02,599
without get damaged

495
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:05,839
so this is what it is so these species

496
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:08,079
down here with a long can take their

497
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,599
cell structure can take a long drought

498
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,278
and a very high negative pressure and by

499
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,278
doing that they can take the drought and

500
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:17,079
still have an active photosynthesis and

501
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:19,599
and still can capture resources and

502
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:22,038
invest in Roots and shots and and things

503
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,480
for next year and that's a very positive

504
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:27,000
thing but this spe it up in the top

505
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,599
there can take it very short and then

506
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,960
the leaf structure destroy

507
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:36,558
is that you understand

508
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,079
or pretty clear okay the interesting

509
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,639
here that there is a difference between

510
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,519
the season you can see in the spring

511
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,919
some of the species that are very very

512
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:47,839
strong in the summer are weak in in the

513
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,679
spring that's interesting when it comes

514
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,639
to climate change when we get have

515
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,798
drought in different parts of the Season

516
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,080
that we even thought

517
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:58,679
before but I would go through and show

518
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,599
it so what it means more practically is

519
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,759
that the trees or the species or the

520
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:07,079
genotypes that belongs to the group up

521
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:09,919
there which have a very low negative

522
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,879
uh pressure on the cell structure these

523
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,440
are the species that rely very much on

524
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,480
the root system avoiding strategies so

525
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,000
they should never ever be planted

526
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,079
outside very generous parking Vines

527
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,440
where they're unlimited resources for

528
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:26,519
the roots but also have a good water

529
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,679
holding capacity in a

530
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:31,278
soil but when you look at the trees

531
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,600
where they grow naturally it makes sense

532
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:36,200
because Asus patum which was the weakest

533
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,240
one in this test this is the place where

534
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,240
you can find it along streams as an

535
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,038
understory species in moist woodlands

536
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,159
and that's the case also for as

537
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,278
pensylvanicum I have no idea what this

538
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:49,440
species calls in English I just stick to

539
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:51,798
the the scientific names this is from

540
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,919
the tree man state park outside

541
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:56,759
Etha but also Asun cartum or mono

542
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,080
whatever you want to call it this is

543
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:01,798
from the tingling mountain in China

544
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:03,839
what I did my PhD work a lot of field

545
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:07,519
work but here you can see it as an

546
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,639
understory tree inside a protected moist

547
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,119
Forest

548
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,679
environment so it makes sense the trees

549
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,599
that have a low turg loss point they

550
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,480
grow naturally in sides but it's a good

551
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,719
guidance also for tree plan is landscape

552
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,120
archit that these trees don't have the

553
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,960
equipment to grow in Street environments

554
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,158
where you have period with really severe

555
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,480
droughts they should always be a garden

556
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:33,278
or Park tree that that's

557
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,919
it but then I had the other group here

558
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:37,839
these are the guys that can take drought

559
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,480
for a longer time they can be planted in

560
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,639
more challenging growing condition

561
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,519
condition like this in a courtyard where

562
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,159
deep

563
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:47,798
rooting

564
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,320
uh strategy is not that clever because

565
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:51,038
you can't force the root system through

566
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,558
the office here through the parking lots

567
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:56,558
and so on it's not possible so trees

568
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:59,240
here have to have a b b c and a d plan

569
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,558
to take this and these guys

570
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,480
have the potential to be growing here be

571
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,798
growing well looking good delivering all

572
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,720
these ecosystem Services they wanted in

573
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:12,000
there even if the condition is really

574
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,360
really challenging and the same thing

575
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,599
when you look at where they grow in

576
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,399
natur in nature you can find them

577
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,038
growing really challenging growing

578
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,080
situation this is AC gred in Tatum from

579
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:26,839
Utah in s national park and if you have

580
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:28,759
to grow here you have to have strategies

581
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:31,240
more than just the root system on that

582
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:32,398
you have to have you have to step up and

583
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,919
take

584
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:37,278
that and this is from the step forest of

585
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,640
Eastern Europe as tataricum together

586
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:42,919
with quercus pans because if you should

587
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,799
grow here on the steps of Eastern Europe

588
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:49,120
you have to have a tolerance to take

589
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:50,558
weeks of drought really severe drought

590
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,959
and every time I have anina in an

591
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,759
audience I have to show this picture

592
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,440
because everybody who takes Nina's

593
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,319
classes she they know that AO Tor we

594
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,519
named as on a

595
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:04,759
stick because Nina doesn't like this

596
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:07,679
tree so that's why I just showing her

597
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:10,359
how goodlooking tree it is this is from

598
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,679
Lun Sweden on a courtyard with a parking

599
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:15,398
deck

600
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,399
Below have you seen enough

601
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,240
Nina yeah I give her few

602
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,720
seconds but also in the same study you

603
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:30,080
can show that it shows that also within

604
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,120
the same species there is a significant

605
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,918
difference between different genotypes

606
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:36,000
and this is interesting when it comes to

607
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,520
selection that within

608
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,359
species you can find both sensitive but

609
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:45,000
also really really tolerant genotype or

610
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:47,079
genetic or ecotype within the species

611
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,720
this is about red maple three different

612
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,439
kind of genotype but

613
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,960
also it's really attractive when my new

614
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,320
job when I have to travel around the

615
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,720
world to collect species that this

616
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,720
mythology makes it possible to screen in

617
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,319
an early stage the potential of the

618
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,159
species so if we are hunting for Drought

619
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:06,639
tolerance tree species or species for a

620
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,600
or genotyp for a future climate we can

621
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,759
use this technology or the methology we

622
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:13,319
develop in order to screen in early we

623
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:15,200
don't have to wait three generation of

624
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:18,839
gardeners before we know it's tolerant

625
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,440
or is weak we can do a really early

626
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:25,398
screening so this is the work we did

627
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,840
last year so this year we went all in to

628
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:29,000
screen as many species that we could in

629
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,798
order to

630
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,599
see especially among the untraditional

631
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:38,359
so this is the work from this

632
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:40,959
year and I will go through them

633
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:42,439
all no I won't but this is what's

634
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,919
happening when you get carried away in

635
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,640
your research you feel like an alcoholic

636
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,200
one more glass this is like one more

637
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,759
species just one more day and this is

638
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,679
the result here so this is about 140

639
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:57,398
species of genotype we're testing this

640
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:00,038
year in order to see but then you can

641
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:03,158
see the significance difference between

642
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:06,440
species and genotype when it comes to Dr

643
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:10,360
tolerance and the main work is in not

644
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,798
only to to create this data set but also

645
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:15,599
testing untraditional or rare tree

646
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:18,278
species because we have to we can't just

647
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,480
go to conference and say that everybody

648
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:23,079
are idiots the nursery industry or the

649
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,798
landscape architect industry we have to

650
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:27,038
give them some kind of guidance or

651
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,480
confidence in order to shift from a

652
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:32,200
traditional plant material to testing

653
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,360
new plants and new species and so on and

654
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,798
by this research is possible to actually

655
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:40,199
show them that for example a

656
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:42,759
comais I think it's Chinese rubber tree

657
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:47,519
that's the English name I look it up

658
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:50,679
sorry Hardy rubber Hardy no

659
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,558
okay I was wrong there anyway rubber

660
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,840
tree and you can see you can show them

661
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,119
that the most common tree for example in

662
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,839
in Sweden is Tila Kata and you can show

663
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,199
that this is fully hard in Sweden but

664
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:05,000
much much more tolerant for dry

665
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,278
conditions so should be better in urban

666
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,599
streets environments compared to til

667
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:12,398
Kata which when it comes to more to dry

668
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:15,439
condition they have all these things

669
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:18,678
going on and honey and so on but the

670
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,919
same thing is important to

671
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:24,038
identify the trees that belongs up there

672
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,000
because in Sweden any a way the

673
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:28,919
landscape architect really really like

674
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,038
Magnolia Cobalts this a new trendy trees

675
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:32,480
they they want it

676
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:34,240
everywhere and they also start to force

677
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,599
them into Street

678
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,919
environments but the result they look

679
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:42,278
like crap because they just have wilting

680
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:44,759
Leaf in July no flowering die off in the

681
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:48,200
tree Crown Z so it's really important

682
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,599
also that show that manula cobos is and

683
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,679
will be an exclusive Park tree or garden

684
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:54,439
tree should never be forced and through

685
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,360
this research it's possible to have that

686
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,880
kind of communication that they don't

687
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,038
have that they don't have they can't

688
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,320
take many punches they just they take

689
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,519
one and then

690
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:06,079
down so it's equally important to

691
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,038
identify the tough ones but also the

692
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:12,119
weak ones in the communication when it

693
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:13,359
comes to um diversification of urban

694
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:16,398
environments so

695
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,719
on and and through this data set I just

696
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,278
narrow it down a little bit to go

697
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,880
through some plants or some groups that

698
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:25,119
this is the Oaks we done 22 different

699
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,399
genotypes of Oaks we testing so you can

700
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:31,599
see it's a huge uh differences between

701
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:34,199
them also within the season bear in mind

702
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,719
that this Axel is changing a little bit

703
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,840
in number so it's but also this work

704
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,960
this is from Birches this is made not

705
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:43,678
here in E Cornell this is made in NES

706
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,240
Garden which is the botanic garden in

707
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:50,278
Liverpool UK by Andrew

708
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,519
irons because um the man director there

709
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:55,759
is um just wrote an a monograph on

710
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,480
Birches so he wanted us to come there

711
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,038
next year we have been invited to queue

712
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,519
Garden in London to do a screening of

713
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:04,240
their trees there because they want to

714
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:06,480
know the future potential of the tree

715
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,558
stock they have at uh at the botanic

716
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,240
garden and so on so the word start to

717
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,720
spread there so so I hope all next year

718
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,759
we can present some really interesting

719
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,440
data when it comes to Red trees from

720
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,519
Botanic Gardens but also we try some

721
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,480
shrub species me and Nina you can also

722
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,960
see this is a ground covering shrubs we

723
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,960
just started with and play a little bit

724
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,278
with but then you can see also that

725
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,440
there is a big difference between

726
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:33,599
species and and and cultiv but also when

727
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,880
it comes to use potential where the

728
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:40,000
potential

729
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:42,640
is so this is what was my goal when we

730
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,558
started this because I will I will try

731
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:49,038
to explain this pretty boring I know but

732
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:53,240
I try to try to explain it n and

733
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:56,319
valadares uh presented a paper 2006 by

734
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:59,399
ranking drought tolerance for 800 wooded

735
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:02,319
species shrubs and trees by reviewing

736
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:05,599
where and how they grow in the

737
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:08,398
wild but this is once again just

738
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,599
assumptions like oh between three and

739
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,119
four so it should be a little bit

740
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:14,599
drought tolerance but what we can show

741
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,558
we put our data based on their ranking

742
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,839
and you can see there is a relationship

743
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:21,398
really close relationship in our data

744
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:23,959
with them but what we can do we can

745
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:25,759
actually show not only like between

746
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,519
three or four should be there we can

747
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,240
actually show a number this is how it is

748
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,000
but also interesting that some of our

749
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,558
most drought tolerant species for

750
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,558
example seringa reticulata what's the

751
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,638
name of that Japanese

752
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:44,319
ler There You

753
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:47,079
Go Japanese treer uh which Dr tolerant

754
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:49,519
but when you base things on rev or

755
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:52,359
review literature you can read about the

756
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,839
species where it grows in southeast

757
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:58,359
Siberia when it grows in cool and moist

758
00:31:54,839 --> 00:32:00,519
sites but when you go to to the

759
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,839
mountains in China he grows together

760
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,519
with alantis a colia one of the most

761
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:07,439
drought tolerant species on very very

762
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:09,558
Rocky and dry sites but they that book

763
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,639
they didn't read so that's why they put

764
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:13,638
them in as a not that drought

765
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,839
tolerant so that that's the when you're

766
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:20,678
reviewing ecological literature together

767
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:24,079
to with the research we

768
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:26,798
doing so as I said we are in a start we

769
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,158
start to develop this database hopefully

770
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,918
next year we can add 100 to the list and

771
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:34,080
so on and work it on and we have a lot

772
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,080
of side projects which is interesting

773
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,720
where you can see that if uh if you

774
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,480
stress a tree they can step it up and

775
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,639
actually increase the turgo loss points

776
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,798
and so so also important to see the

777
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:46,519
window how much they can take not only

778
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,519
when they're growing in plant Park

779
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:50,240
environment but also when you stress

780
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:53,200
them and see how much they can step up

781
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,359
some species doesn't have that uh

782
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,840
capacity some species have a very wide

783
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,240
capacity so bear in mind this is just a

784
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,599
starting it but I I think it's really

785
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,599
interesting and the most of all is

786
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:06,319
really interesting or very useful in

787
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,839
order to communicate with tree users the

788
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:12,038
plant user plant

789
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:14,839
designers how much time do I have

790
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:17,119
left okay then I would like to show

791
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:19,038
another perspective that we work with as

792
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,879
well because when it comes to plant

793
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:24,398
selection many things that trees right

794
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,039
tree for right sight but I would like to

795
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:30,079
add another aspect of that right tree

796
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:32,480
for right sight and functions because

797
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:35,038
when it comes to Urban Tree or Urban

798
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,599
Forest today everybody's talking about

799
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:41,440
tree increase the Urban Tree canopy and

800
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:43,199
so on if we increase with uh 10% we will

801
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,399
gain this and if we

802
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,360
a add another 10% we will gain that

803
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,918
that's not possible I don't I I can't

804
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:53,240
buy that I'm sorry because it's

805
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:56,080
different between trees and trees

806
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,519
because when it comes to a landscape

807
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:00,879
architect and I'm one of the most hated

808
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,638
teachers in my University because I'm

809
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,360
the guy that shows up in the

810
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:08,759
presentation and just ask them why why

811
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:10,239
this green blob there what is it and

812
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,599
what should it do

813
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:16,519
there I don't know it's a street we

814
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,720
plant trees along the street and then I

815
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:20,800
fail them they have to come back they

816
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:24,799
have to every dot they have to have an

817
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:28,119
idea why and which tree should be there

818
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,280
because when it comes to buying a car

819
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,838
we don't go in and say I just want to

820
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,879
buy a car we don't do that because when

821
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,440
we buy a

822
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:39,799
car we have a lot of ideas what we want

823
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,039
for the car what kind of car how should

824
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,800
I look in the car and so on what kind of

825
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:46,519
stereo what kind of all this bling bling

826
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,159
but if you don't do that if you just go

827
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:51,519
in there and say I want a car you can

828
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:54,039
end up with this one but that is good

829
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:55,960
that's a lottery but at the same time

830
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:59,960
you can end up with this

831
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,639
one both is a are but the capacity

832
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,720
between them is

833
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:05,279
different but this is what we're doing

834
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:09,439
when it comes to tree selection for

835
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,599
ecosystem services or trees are good for

836
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,720
pollution reducing pollution or

837
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,720
mitigating Urban heat island so that's

838
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:18,959
why we plant tree without thinking of

839
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:21,919
where to place them and which beaches to

840
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,639
use and that's very very frustrating

841
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,639
because it's much more because this tree

842
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:28,239
is not a tree sometimes goes well this

843
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,838
is two good example this is from

844
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,479
Stockholm this is from Manchester in UK

845
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:34,559
when the tree selection have been really

846
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,719
good probably it's just luck but

847
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,960
sometimes they're using species that

848
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,639
doing a good job there taking the wind

849
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,800
or shading the situation where it's

850
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,639
needed but sometimes it's sometimes you

851
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,240
can actually can plant tree and make

852
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:49,559
more problems rather than actually

853
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,719
benefits for the

854
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:55,799
tree and I would like to show this is

855
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:58,199
research I'm just part of so Johanna

856
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,760
braise your hand is the main

857
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:02,960
uh person behind this research I'm the

858
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,359
plant geek I'm in the end just adding

859
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,639
some trees and so on but I I would like

860
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:11,960
to just show this this is a um a program

861
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:15,838
a climate uh modeling program where it's

862
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,480
possible to to see the effect of urban

863
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:21,078
green infrastructure and how we can uh

864
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,159
adjust the microclimate in an in a

865
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:27,960
building area it's like Minecraft from

866
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:28,920
grown-ups you're building up uh um what

867
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,838
hit the

868
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:37,880
quer neighbor a neighborhood um in a 3D

869
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:40,239
um way this is the houses and then you

870
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,920
add numbers of the houses if a concrete

871
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,199
house is a wooded house how tall they

872
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,559
are uh what kind of roof it is uh if you

873
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:51,239
have climbing plants and on the and also

874
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:54,799
which kind of glasses and so on but also

875
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:57,118
it's not only taking the the the buildup

876
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,119
uh environment but also the outdoor

877
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,280
environment

878
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:04,039
what kind of surface is it is it

879
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,839
concrete graveled grass uh is a shrub

880
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:08,199
Plantation is a tree how tall the trees

881
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,639
on which kind of level and so on and

882
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:12,639
then you build this up it's called MV

883
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:15,799
met and then you can download it for

884
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:18,440
free on internet and then you add local

885
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,839
climate data and then you press the

886
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,000
button and take a weekend or 10 days or

887
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:26,239
so and then you come back and this have

888
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,559
been uh harvesting for a long time but

889
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,759
the problem in the beginning was that

890
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:33,000
that the plant data is not available so

891
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,800
the work we have done for three or four

892
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,800
or five years

893
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:45,719
yeah yeah

894
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:08,358
yes so we have been collecting this Leaf

895
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:12,199
area index data for I think it's about

896
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:14,559
75 or 80 trees pieces U and then we add

897
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:16,159
these values in and this is what can

898
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,318
have and then you can ask different kind

899
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,960
of question it's also for pollution but

900
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:22,838
also for wind speed from microclimate

901
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,838
and so on so then you can get a good

902
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:26,799
pictures it's not only you here in the

903
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:29,119
USA that have stupid politics like

904
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,119
Donald Trump and so on also in Sweden we

905
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:36,079
have pretty slow minded people that are

906
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:40,760
politic politic but this is a a model

907
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:42,720
where it's possible to to show or to to

908
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,760
communicate the effect of green

909
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,078
infrastructure within building areas I I

910
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,480
will show you when it comes to wind

911
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,119
speed this is the housing area with no

912
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,880
trees whatsoever this is the ocean here

913
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,200
there's a lot of wind comes in so you

914
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,079
can see there's a really window

915
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:57,679
especially in this passage when you when

916
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,160
you force the wind in and here here you

917
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,679
have more or less storm every day and

918
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,920
it's really good when you do this study

919
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:07,000
to ask uh dog people because people with

920
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,440
dogs need to go out every day even if

921
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,760
it's snow storm or raining so they know

922
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,960
you can ask them where's the worst spot

923
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,200
and then can actually give the exact

924
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:21,199
same what this modeling program do but

925
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:24,039
this is um the effect if you add due to

926
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,679
the master plan with a fancy landscape

927
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:27,719
architect company in Stockholm did I

928
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,519
don't think they even wear here to look

929
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:33,000
at the the site so they they did more a

930
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:34,960
traditional way of placing the green

931
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,079
infrastructure trees here group of

932
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,000
Plantation here and so on so you can see

933
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:44,000
that they reduce the wind something but

934
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,880
what we deal after that is to

935
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,519
placed just to change some of the

936
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,119
species to other species but also place

937
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:55,480
them in other in other s so to say in

938
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,880
order to gain most

939
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,358
effect and this is one

940
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,000
proposal and this is the one so by using

941
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:06,639
this program and also adding you can

942
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,280
show that species

943
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,879
selection not only placing the species

944
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,880
but also which kind of species we're

945
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,880
using

946
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,119
matters I think it's

947
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,880
cool and this is on the summer but when

948
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,480
it comes to Winter you have the bronch

949
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,119
Shir index because we have long Winters

950
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,760
in Sweden we need to care about how the

951
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:32,358
trees are acting in the

952
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:35,640
winters because in this in the winter we

953
00:40:32,358 --> 00:40:38,679
don't want any any tree not close to

954
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:42,559
buildings because the Sun that hits the

955
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:45,118
buildings in in winter time warms up as

956
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,639
much as we can reduce 30% of the heating

957
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,800
cost that's a lot of money we can use by

958
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:53,559
just using the sun energy just hitting

959
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,680
their their facad in the winter time so

960
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:58,719
by placing Trees Too Close in a winter

961
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:01,679
time with too dense canopy can cool down

962
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:05,118
and actually increase the heating costs

963
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:07,719
in a winter time then we have a negative

964
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:11,358
ecosystem Services actually that's bad

965
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:12,959
so by placing trees just increasing tree

966
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:14,838
canopy without actually thinking about

967
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,679
where and how to place them we can

968
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:19,078
actually cause

969
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:22,598
problem so this is what we want we want

970
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:25,440
trees that have a dense canopy

971
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:28,119
summertimes with a lot of leaf High Leaf

972
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,200
area index that cool down facades and

973
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:34,838
building or even if a we have a square

974
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:38,000
where we have Tor

975
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:40,239
handle markets so so on on the Square in

976
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,199
the summer time we want to have shade

977
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,639
but in the winter we want to have a lot

978
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:47,199
of sun so what we look at is trees that

979
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,759
are dense in the summer but sparse in

980
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,318
the in the winter and let a lot of

981
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,200
sunlight through the tree

982
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:55,599
canopy so we did a research of

983
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,118
evaluating different tree species when

984
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,838
it comes to Branch ARA index

985
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,440
and this is Gino Boba which is more like

986
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:05,880
a joke when it comes to shading

987
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,720
wintertime because it doesn't have

988
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,800
anything more or less but then we have

989
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:14,598
this this is a carpinus betus fata which

990
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,359
is a horn beam upright which is very

991
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,838
very

992
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:23,000
dense so this can shade a lot but at the

993
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:25,558
same time the Ginko can't reduce any

994
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,679
winds in a winter time because winds is

995
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,480
another Shilling Factor so you don't

996
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,118
want to maybe have Trees close to the

997
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:35,119
buildings but a little bit farther away

998
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:38,000
to reduce winds so Geno doesn't do

999
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,480
anything while the hornbeam do a great

1000
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,239
job for that and then we have something

1001
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,880
in between this is Atlantis so we did an

1002
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:51,639
evaluation about um 55 or 60 species or

1003
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,680
genotypes of trees about 30 35 years old

1004
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:56,920
planted the same time planting the same

1005
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:58,358
site and so on so was evaluating so you

1006
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,280
can see that when it comes to Branch

1007
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:02,558
area index that's the density of tree

1008
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,000
crowns in the winter you have gko this

1009
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,000
is from Stockholm a new Ginko

1010
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:13,400
Plantation but one of the most dense is

1011
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:16,880
the upright corinos or the horn

1012
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,519
beam so what we did we are playing

1013
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,079
around with this Envy met again and then

1014
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,079
we place this is a courtyard this is a

1015
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,160
buildings the wind comes main the main

1016
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,240
wind comes from the West here and then

1017
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:30,318
we placed a tree free row it look like

1018
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,959
it's a hedge but it's not because in the

1019
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:35,159
program when if the canopy touches each

1020
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,920
other then it's it's looks like a hedge

1021
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:40,118
but it's not it's just a traditional Tre

1022
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,440
row but what we did is using the data or

1023
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:45,800
the the the values we collected from

1024
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:49,000
this uh the data the field the brch a

1025
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,318
index data and add it into the program

1026
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,039
to see how much they can reduce the

1027
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:56,400
wind which is a very important ecosystem

1028
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:58,480
service when it comes to Sweden anyway

1029
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,838
because we don't we don't have that warm

1030
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,199
Summers but we have cold Winters so

1031
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:05,480
reducing the wind and a cold temperature

1032
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:08,919
winter time is more important in order

1033
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,440
to to reduce energy cost but also a

1034
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,119
really good outdoor environment so we go

1035
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:17,200
through this is Gino

1036
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:21,880
Boba this is Noel Maple Emerald Queen

1037
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:24,199
Hony long hyong Locust or it's turkey

1038
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:29,720
Oak coros

1039
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:33,279
Kona fat hornbeam and last uh upright

1040
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:35,519
type of uh of of Western Pine but then

1041
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,519
you can

1042
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:45,358
see so we have to care which trees we're

1043
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,559
placing where because there is different

1044
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:51,440
capacity within between species and even

1045
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:53,720
between genotype within the same species

1046
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,480
so we can't just say that if we increase

1047
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:57,719
the tree canopy with 10 or 50% we will

1048
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,240
gain that

1049
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:02,679
and this and so on we have to be more

1050
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,639
precise we have to force ourself in the

1051
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:06,639
planning of the green infrastructure to

1052
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,199
talk about detail to talk about plant

1053
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,960
selection but also the spacing where to

1054
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:15,000
put them and so on and this is really

1055
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:18,039
clear uh uh research that really show

1056
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,039
and this is this paper is out it's um uh

1057
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:22,838
published early this year so if you want

1058
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:27,199
some copy of this paper please let me

1059
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:30,000
know I will send it to you

1060
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:32,239
so to summarize this uh presentation is

1061
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,679
that I would like to launch the

1062
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:37,639
statement that the cool people the most

1063
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,318
important people the new superheroes in

1064
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:42,078
the future will be the plant Geeks

1065
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,000
because the plant Geeks are the people

1066
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:48,160
that knows all

1067
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,480
these stupid facts about plants but

1068
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:55,440
these stupid facts all these details are

1069
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:58,000
important in order to to uh build

1070
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,760
or construct

1071
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,239
res resilient Urban

1072
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:05,760
environments so that's it thank you very

1073
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:05,759
much for

1074
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,760
listening looking at the graph that you

1075
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:16,679
showed with the drug

1076
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:19,520
tolerance uh for spring and then for

1077
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:21,799
summer yeah you're concentrating on the

1078
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:25,318
summer data and more or less ignoring

1079
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,960
the the spring data no I it maybe in my

1080
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:31,199
talk here but in in the we we we care

1081
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,440
about the the spring de is equal because

1082
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:36,960
it's interesting

1083
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,280
that the weak ones so to say they have

1084
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,720
more or less the same values in the

1085
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,480
spring as in the summer they don't

1086
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:45,239
change that much they go out weak and

1087
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:48,240
stay weak but interesting that the most

1088
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:50,439
drought tolerance uh species in in the

1089
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,479
summer some of them are really really

1090
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,679
weak in the spring for example the

1091
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,199
Golden Rain Tree

1092
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:00,879
colia in it's one of the weakest in the

1093
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:03,318
spring but in the summer it's maybe

1094
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,480
number one number two in our data so far

1095
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:07,279
it's really really strong and that's

1096
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,400
also important when we transplant the

1097
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,160
trees are establish the trees they are

1098
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,358
very weak in the beginning so we have to

1099
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:15,759
focus even if it's drout to when it's

1100
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,358
established it could be really fragile

1101
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,160
in in establishment phase especially in

1102
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:22,119
the spring phase that we have to be

1103
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:24,519
really careful to walking the PS so but

1104
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:27,280
is what's happening then uh with this

1105
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:29,960
adjustment from the spring to the summer

1106
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,280
that you're having osmotic adjustment by

1107
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,199
the by the tree because you've got a

1108
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:38,800
series of small stresses during that

1109
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:41,000
period which adapts it to the drer

1110
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,160
condition exactly so that's also the

1111
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,838
next step we actually we have some

1112
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:51,598
spinoff studies going going on beside

1113
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:53,599
this doing trying to compile this big

1114
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,960
data set that we have trees that grows

1115
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,440
for example in the plantation we have

1116
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:02,119
unlimited the same species or even same

1117
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,880
downtown with more restricting pl we

1118
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:06,720
have been actually um done some root

1119
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,519
penetrating rers we know exactly how

1120
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:11,480
much space they have but then you can

1121
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:13,759
see that the trees in the plantation of

1122
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,318
course because if I have unlimited why

1123
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,280
invest that much because everything's

1124
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:21,199
good here the downtown they invest very

1125
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,160
very much much much higher but

1126
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:26,799
interesting in this St is that the Coria

1127
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:30,078
uh the gold R Tree have the same high

1128
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:33,720
levels even in a plantation as downtown

1129
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:36,039
so they just invest in very high or very

1130
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:38,318
low tural loss Point even if they are

1131
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:40,239
standing in unlimited rooting space they

1132
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:42,000
just programm to be really strong from

1133
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:44,838
the beginning they don't have any other

1134
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,239
thoughts but for example cusia which is

1135
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:50,920
other spe in the same study have this

1136
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:52,838
huge adjustments between planting

1137
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,639
Plantation with unlimited space compared

1138
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:57,400
to for example the library downtown is

1139
00:48:55,639 --> 00:49:02,159
very limited

1140
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:03,920
they have maybe half or double its turbo

1141
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:06,078
loss point you can take it more because

1142
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,200
they have adjustable the side so what we

1143
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,640
see there there is among some species

1144
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:14,519
some species just have a burden St from

1145
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:16,239
the very beginning what we can see that

1146
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:19,280
there's a lot of things we have to

1147
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:22,078
continue look at but what's interesting

1148
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,079
is to to developing knowledge about the

1149
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,318
window how much you can take or the the

1150
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,680
adjustment That's The Next Step In This

1151
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,519
research to try to understand which

1152
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:34,798
beaches had a very narrow window for

1153
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:37,440
example City It Go or as goes out

1154
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:39,280
weak stay weak and doesn't have any

1155
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,838
adjustment but then you have some other

1156
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:45,000
species like perusia we have a way Wide

1157
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:47,279
Window of adjustment so that's the next

1158
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
phas to try to create these window to

1159
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:55,000
see how wide they are and how narrow

1160
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,000
they are so but we are working on

1161
00:49:56,798 --> 00:50:04,798
er uh along those same lines if you look

1162
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:08,160
at a moisture release curve for a soil a

1163
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:13,199
Sandy lone soil the volumetric water

1164
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:16,838
content at a water potential of -4 megap

1165
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:19,639
pascals for example is vanishingly small

1166
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:24,599
not a whole lot of water even left there

1167
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:27,719
might be interesting to look at the

1168
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:31,039
duration of drought

1169
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:34,798
in reference to something like potential

1170
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:37,279
evapo transpiration to see so to speak

1171
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:40,119
to use a different metaphor how long the

1172
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,880
plant was going to have to hold its

1173
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:45,559
breath if you're investing a lot of

1174
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,000
energy in making neutral osmotica for

1175
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:51,119
osmotic adjustment and you're going to

1176
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,798
get another 6 hours worth of ability to

1177
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:57,920
extract water that might be a less

1178
00:50:54,798 --> 00:51:00,920
prudent kind of adjustment investment

1179
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:04,680
yeah definitely I I I totally agree the

1180
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:07,720
think we through this methology we we is

1181
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:09,558
a we come up with new spin-off and try

1182
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:12,759
to relate it here try to relate it there

1183
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:14,400
and so on so it's yeah I totally agree

1184
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,720
we could we should look at that as well

1185
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,559
so it's we are in the very beginning of

1186
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:21,480
this this work so by creating this data

1187
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:23,839
set and next year we're going to compare

1188
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:27,159
to we're going to work a three place at

1189
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:30,078
Q got the wordon god also here in

1190
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:33,199
Cornell so we while we create in this

1191
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:35,039
data database it's more it's greater

1192
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:38,480
chance to stop and play with it starty

1193
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,679
to to to see see the same thing but from

1194
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,519
different angles and S play I'm totally

1195
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:46,759
agree with you okay I think we're out of

1196
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:49,400
time I I would like to end by say thank

1197
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,599
you for having me here for almost two

1198
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,160
years and I would like to thanks Nina of

1199
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,798
course to taking so good care of me here

1200
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:59,440
both in Corel but also outside the world

1201
00:51:56,798 --> 00:52:03,079
here by helping me to get a credit card

1202
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,079
American credit card no

1203
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:10,719
idea social security number

1204
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:13,159
impossible to beat up some people but Al

1205
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:15,639
also the people in at the department I

1206
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:17,239
really enjoy to be here and we have some

1207
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:19,400
as you probably understand we have a lot

1208
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:21,039
of things going on and I will come back

1209
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,480
here but I want to thank you for this

1210
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:25,558
time I really enjoy it and I was really

1211
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,179
inspiring to be here so thank you very

1212
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:33,400
much thank you

1213
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:35,759
