1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,060
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,060
University

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,039
thank you

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:16,649
it's always a pleasure to be among the

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,160
soil scientists and particularly Tony

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:23,070
who was very generous with his time in

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,129
teaching us about his work as a

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,410
scientists many years ago one of my

9
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:31,019
former students interviewed Tony and

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,210
that interview was edited into something

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,609
that we call an oral history profile and

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,579
it was included in that 2010 book that

13
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:41,420
Tony mentioned and I'll be quoting you

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,699
in a few minutes

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:48,740
so um

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:52,070
I am as some of you may be

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:55,340
fairly agitated right now and

18
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,509
angry and worried

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:01,050
not just about what happened in the

20
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:03,109
election but about deeper issues and

21
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:07,618
questions that have to do with

22
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:11,069
the state of our society how well how

23
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:14,519
divided we are and how well or how

24
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:17,629
poorly we understand each other how well

25
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,829
or how poorly we listen to each other um

26
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:21,619
it's not irrelevant for me to say that

27
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,719
at the beginning of this

28
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:27,540
session because the the theme or topic

29
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,200
or idea of civic science is very much

30
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,200
centered on

31
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,710
relationships between scientists and

32
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:36,780
non-scientists that include a lot of

33
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:40,129
listening and a lot of understanding and

34
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,439
a lot of dealing with difference

35
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:46,048
mmm

36
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:49,109
so this is a topic that I have been

37
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,229
working on for a number of years I am

38
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:55,590
I've got as most of us do way too many

39
00:01:52,228 --> 00:02:00,510
balls in the air and so things proceed

40
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:03,450
more slowly than they should but I we

41
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:07,530
had an NSF workshop on this theme as

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,679
Tony mentioned in 2014 or working on

43
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,650
both an essay and a book project related

44
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,289
to this theme of civic science the theme

45
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,819
resonates across a lot of my work so

46
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:20,139
it's it's something that isn't just

47
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:23,589
contained there I feel rather strangely

48
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:25,268
double miked here so I don't feel like

49
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,539
I'm on an interrogation stage or

50
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:31,299
something and then I see this one person

51
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:35,729
sitting there Geneva like the judge

52
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:35,730
sitting sitting in front of the court

53
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:43,739
so civic science is a term like a lot of

54
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:47,108
terms we hear about

55
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:50,099
that first of all it has a it has a

56
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:54,120
history of us as a specific term

57
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:57,908
part of its genealogy is that it was

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:02,400
first actually maybe first probably not

59
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:04,168
first but maybe first used in

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:10,329
1996

61
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:13,049
in a talk that Neil Lane gave when he

62
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:17,049
was the director of NSF

63
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:18,370
and he was speaking to a meeting of the

64
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:20,530
american association for the advancement

65
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,620
of science and talking about the role of

66
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,239
science and scientists in society and he

67
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,419
used the term civic science to talk

68
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,419
about

69
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:32,348
basically the the idea that scientists

70
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,889
should be communicating to the public

71
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:37,688
more frequently they should be taking

72
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:41,019
more time to be helping the public

73
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:42,608
understand science they should be taking

74
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:46,000
more time to share the results of

75
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:50,739
science to be bringing scientific

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,989
knowledge and ideas to the public at all

77
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,359
kinds of variety of ways not just panels

78
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:57,639
in Washington DC not just media

79
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:58,229
interviews but in community settings as

80
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,019
well

81
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:05,799
mmm that is not what i mean by civic

82
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,840
science the definition that he gave is

83
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,509
not it Oh Civic science is also not

84
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,878
citizen science the way I'm talking

85
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:15,789
about it it's not

86
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:17,858
applied research it's not activist

87
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:22,319
science it's not it's there's all kinds

88
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:25,598
of turns out there it's none of those

89
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,750
so I want to share a bit about how I

90
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:31,719
have been coming to find and discover

91
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,430
this idea of civic science my work

92
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,160
and how I've been trying to make sense

93
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,680
of it and some of the questions I have

94
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,320
about it I'm sorry to be relying on on

95
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,540
notes a lot here but I want to be

96
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,420
careful and as i mentioned i'm fairly

97
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,550
agitated right now and suffering from

98
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,379
lack of sleep my wife is a state

99
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,639
legislator she was just reacted to her

100
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:54,589
seventh term the new york state assembly

101
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,019
so I was up all night the other night

102
00:04:54,589 --> 00:05:00,250
and

103
00:04:56,019 --> 00:05:04,299
apologies for my own trouble

104
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,649
so civic science is not a dreamy

105
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,420
theoretical thing that some egghead

106
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:12,069
professor like me and development

107
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:16,550
sociology made up and is trying to

108
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:19,730
you know sell to two people it's not

109
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,189
that it's a discovery it's a way of

110
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:24,620
naming a discovery out of my own

111
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:27,620
research out of other people's research

112
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,209
I'm primarily a historian but I come to

113
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,790
the work of history with a lot of tools

114
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:33,979
from a variety of disciplines i'anson

115
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,890
technology studies development sociology

116
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,689
narrative in Korean analysis civic

117
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,240
studies political theory public

118
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:42,879
philosophy I draw from all of those in

119
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,769
my historical work

120
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,909
mmm

121
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:48,639
civic science is something that is

122
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,410
deeply rooted in

123
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,889
land grant colleges of agriculture

124
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:58,160
including this one very much so but it

125
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:59,620
is not contained to those colleges as a

126
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,790
historical trajectory

127
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,040
just one of the things that has happened

128
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,470
recently in the in the literature's that

129
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,480
I pay attention to historian from

130
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,250
Harvard named Andrew Jewett is published

131
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,410
a book recently that I wrote a review

132
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,319
for for a journal it's called science

133
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:18,200
democracy in the American University

134
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,089
from the Civil War to the Cold War what

135
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:24,909
he does in this book is he traces what

136
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:24,909
he refers to as a history of

137
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:31,639
scientific Democrats that's his turn

138
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,720
from the Civil War to the Cold War and

139
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,969
what he's tracing is something that is

140
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,610
not there's not a lot of awareness of a

141
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:43,020
whole variety of places and there's a

142
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,689
lot of critique of and push back again

143
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:49,889
what he's tracing is this history of

144
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:52,978
thinking and work about how democracy

145
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:57,389
sorry how science the methods and

146
00:06:52,978 --> 00:07:00,050
processes of science have huge deep

147
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,610
cultural and political significance and

148
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,470
and

149
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,509
possibilities

150
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,889
and so there were a lot of people who

151
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,840
thinking these are mostly people in

152
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,658
fields like political theory and

153
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,519
philosophy and psychology and those

154
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:19,050
kinds of fields a lot of people were

155
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:20,899
were deeply convinced that if we could

156
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,120
spread

157
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:26,158
scientific the what they people like

158
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,750
John do is do we variously referred to

159
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:30,269
as the scientific spirit or the

160
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,709
scientific morale Liberty High Bailey

161
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:33,930
wrote about this which I'll come back to

162
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:37,439
if we could spread that if people could

163
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,598
could learn to see the world using some

164
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,370
of the methods and processes of Sciences

165
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,639
this would have huge transformational

166
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:47,218
implications for our culture and

167
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:50,639
ones that are aligned with what we

168
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:51,839
usually referred to as democracy and you

169
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,310
know most of you in this room i'm

170
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,038
assuming our scientists we can think

171
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,439
about this you do experiments you make

172
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:01,019
them visible in public what you did what

173
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,968
you found and it's up for debate other

174
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:04,318
people can try and see if they find the

175
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:06,449
same thing or something different

176
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,819
there's real deep democratic

177
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:10,110
possibilities in that kind of thing it

178
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,718
comes out of the whole notion of who

179
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,270
gets to create knowledge

180
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:17,339
well based on the work of science

181
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:19,560
anybody who can learn these methods and

182
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:21,869
processes can take part in that it

183
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,028
doesn't come just from the church or a

184
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,180
dog love or the government or the King

185
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:28,348
you know these are big historical

186
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,090
things I'm talking about here anyway

187
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:32,448
there's so there's this long tradition

188
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:32,448
of that

189
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,349
so

190
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:39,209
civic science is connected to that as

191
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,490
I'll talk about a little more clearly in

192
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:44,449
a minute at the at the center of civic

193
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,250
science as an idea

194
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,470
the way I'm understanding it is that it

195
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:53,028
represents a particular way of answering

196
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:55,620
a set of normative questions

197
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:57,840
about the roles responsibilities

198
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,370
purposes and war work of scientists and

199
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,960
scientific institutions like

200
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,149
universities

201
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,250
in the civic sphere or in civic or

202
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:06,600
public life it's about the Nate that

203
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,279
questions about the nature of the

204
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,029
relationship between scientists and

205
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,709
non-scientists

206
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:17,299
particularly in societies that that

207
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:19,860
strive to be or want to be democratic

208
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:22,159
so civic science represents a way of

209
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:26,519
answering these questions

210
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:29,899
so it's important to note normative

211
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:33,000
questions are not empirical questions

212
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:35,059
they're not about what is or what has

213
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,159
been or what could be

214
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:39,929
they use this troubling word in the

215
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,219
Academy we have a lot of problems with

216
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:43,219
this word the word is should

217
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,580
Civic science represents a way of

218
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:54,059
answering a set of questions by taking

219
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:56,879
up by taking the word should and

220
00:09:54,059 --> 00:10:00,799
answering it not just inferior ideas but

221
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,799
in practice in the world

222
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,970
so the prevailing way of answering this

223
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:07,620
bundle of questions about the role in

224
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,029
relationship between science and non

225
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,429
scientists and science in the public

226
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:14,009
sphere the the prevailing way of

227
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:17,689
understanding that is that the it's

228
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:21,269
basically an expert client relationship

229
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:24,650
science scientists scientists scientific

230
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:29,360
institutions produce stuff

231
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:31,759
which is communicated out to the world

232
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,470
and

233
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,559
they produce stuff from a place of

234
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:40,470
detachment from

235
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:42,389
that world and why is this this is to

236
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,550
use the fancy academic words there's an

237
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:46,679
epistemological

238
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:48,299
reason for this because one of the most

239
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,459
fundamental questions we could take up

240
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:54,649
in a day in any society is how do we

241
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:57,509
produce knowledge that people can trust

242
00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:00,689
trustworthy knowledge how do we do that

243
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:02,819
where do we do that who does that so

244
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,740
there's a whole way of kind of

245
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,830
prevailing sense of well you need a

246
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,610
detached thing that's outside the biased

247
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,660
and messy world of the marketplace and

248
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,710
government and this you can't trust

249
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:15,329
stuff that comes out of there because

250
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,009
it's going to be self-interested in bias

251
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,600
so you need someplace that's apart from

252
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,000
that

253
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,409
where people can

254
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,929
pursue work from a objective

255
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:27,990
disinterested unbiased these kinds of

256
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:30,239
words people use perspective so that's

257
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,389
the sort of a typical way that we look

258
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,070
at the the set of normative questions so

259
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:36,659
about what we should do what our

260
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,690
relationship should be our meaning

261
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:42,329
scientists so civic science as I've been

262
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,670
learning in my research and work and it

263
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,970
have been understanding coming to

264
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:50,009
understand doesn't dismiss it's not

265
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,350
about dismissing questions of

266
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:54,120
trustworthiness and of course in a land

267
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,860
grant institution we're not just

268
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,139
interested in trustworthiness we're

269
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,409
instance interested in knowledge people

270
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:03,830
can trust and use that

271
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:06,778
the use piece is pretty important

272
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:09,750
so the civic science tradition that I'm

273
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:12,929
uncovering and try to understand doesn't

274
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:15,230
dismiss all that it doesn't say that we

275
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:17,309
that we should never have

276
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:20,639
people working from a place of

277
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:23,609
detachment in laboratories on campuses

278
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,159
up on hills like Cornell here the

279
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:29,220
classic ivory tower it doesn't say we

280
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,719
shouldn't have that what I'm finding in

281
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,269
my own work and this is definitely

282
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,089
influenced by my own perspective which I

283
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:38,789
need to be transparent about the fancy

284
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:41,520
word for that is reflexive to be

285
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:45,929
reflexive is to be conscious of your own

286
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,059
biases and political views and and to be

287
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:50,809
candid about those and I definitely have

288
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:53,669
them and that'll come out in a minute

289
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:56,429
so the tradition that I'm uncovering

290
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:58,169
doesn't reject all of that what it does

291
00:12:56,429 --> 00:13:02,579
and the best way to understand it is it

292
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:04,519
expands and broadens the ground and the

293
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,459
set of possibilities

294
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:11,458
for how to be a scientist

295
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:12,778
for you're not it means that science

296
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,500
scientists don't always have to be

297
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:18,720
detached in laboratories up on hills

298
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,779
that sometimes you can be there and you

299
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,620
can be out in the and

300
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:25,539
telling this people in this room of this

301
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,450
this is nothing new this is what people

302
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:29,909
have done in this college for over a

303
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,770
hundred years

304
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:35,639
but not everybody thinks about that or

305
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:35,639
understands that

306
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,310
what's important about Civic science I

307
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,230
think

308
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:46,028
which moves us to the place of deep deep

309
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,990
deep complexity way beyond what I'm

310
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:51,789
going to be able to do here with you

311
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,549
both because of time and and other

312
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:56,110
issues it's important about it is that

313
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:59,759
it doesn't just expand these

314
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:03,100
possibilities of how to do work

315
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:06,460
it also opens up very distinctive kinds

316
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:09,000
of promise promises possible of meaning

317
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:12,850
and significance of the work

318
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,679
and in doing that it opens up very

319
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,680
distinctive kinds of challenges and

320
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:19,179
problems so what I want to do today

321
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,909
hopefully in enough time for us to have

322
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:23,019
some interaction

323
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:25,689
because I could go on for way too long

324
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,980
in my agitated state I want to I want to

325
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,930
begin with a couple of historical

326
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,480
artifacts from our own college here at

327
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:33,539
Cornell

328
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,430
brief historical artifacts

329
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:38,439
then I want to very briefly and very

330
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:41,139
superficially start taking up the task

331
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,820
of interpreting those artifacts this is

332
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:45,458
the research of that I do as a scholar

333
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:50,140
so i'm working with original material

334
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:52,479
and data and as a historian I don't just

335
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:55,179
paste and copy that data I have to

336
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,080
position it in a narrative position it

337
00:14:55,179 --> 00:15:00,549
in a in an essay that interprets the

338
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,500
meaning and significance of these

339
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:04,479
artifacts have to put them in context

340
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,690
and I have to use tools to be able to do

341
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,580
that so I want to I want to very briefly

342
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,620
sort of show you

343
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,810
sort of the inside it's like walking

344
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,149
into my lab in some ways it's like the

345
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:17,849
the inside nuts and bolts of how we work

346
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:20,559
with this of this material

347
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,690
thinking of these artifacts like you

348
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,559
would think of plant material or poor

349
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,560
soil samples

350
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:32,159
then I want to turn to the issue of

351
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:34,328
actual practice of civic science in

352
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,698
contemporary times this is what I'm

353
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:37,948
going to quote you

354
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:39,988
I'm going to quote somebody else more

355
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:41,208
than I'm going to quote you I'll save

356
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:43,559
you

357
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:45,328
and then I want to conclude by just

358
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:48,688
naming some of the challenges and

359
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:51,058
questions that arise for me and thinking

360
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:54,298
about this theme and before I plunge

361
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:57,688
into this I'll say that I am approaching

362
00:15:54,298 --> 00:16:00,088
and doing this work in many ways out of

363
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:01,828
a sense of urgent necessity because I

364
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:03,350
think institutions like this are in

365
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:06,198
trouble

366
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:09,749
and I think our communities and our

367
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:13,159
society is in trouble and beyond the

368
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:15,749
trouble I think there are enormous

369
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:18,958
incredible possibilities that are

370
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:21,749
untapped positive possibilities that

371
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,599
Civic science I think has a big role to

372
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:26,009
play in opening up both in dealing with

373
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,558
troubles but also in opening up

374
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:31,079
possibilities

375
00:16:27,558 --> 00:16:33,028
so here are the artifacts I'm just these

376
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:36,058
are two things I found in my historical

377
00:16:33,028 --> 00:16:38,548
research the little little data points

378
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:42,808
through a moment in time so the first

379
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:43,948
one actually is from 1920 to the former

380
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:46,078
director of Cornell Cooperative

381
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:48,328
Extension a man named Maurice chase

382
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:51,078
burritt MC birotte we were up in a farm

383
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:51,078
in western New York

384
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,558
graduate of Cornell

385
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:58,528
it's called the County agent and the

386
00:16:55,558 --> 00:17:00,988
Farm Bureau a real barn Buster barn

387
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:03,708
burner kind of title right whale want to

388
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:06,568
read this was 19 22 so it was very

389
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:08,490
pretty shortly after the farm bureau was

390
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:11,688
created we know the first one was in New

391
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:14,759
York and broome county and

392
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:16,679
shortly after 1914 less than 10 years

393
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:18,990
after when the National extension system

394
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,649
was created and this County agent thing

395
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:24,480
was it was a big deal

396
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:26,250
he this guy went on I don't know if

397
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,069
anybody knows who he was but he had all

398
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:33,259
kinds of roles in New York agriculture

399
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:37,278
and state and United States policy mmm

400
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:37,278
so at the end of this book

401
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:44,128
he he actually didn't write this here's

402
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:46,678
not to go to it he says at the very the

403
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:49,679
last two pages he said summarizing then

404
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:51,540
the ideal expressed this volume for the

405
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,299
Farm Bureau movement may be put in the

406
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:56,730
form of this brief Creed and then he

407
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,399
lays out what he calls a farm bureau

408
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,200
Creed

409
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,530
so here are four sentences from that

410
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,529
Creed

411
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:10,259
we believe in self-help for ourselves

412
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:12,090
our community our country in our own

413
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:14,369
abilities well developed and properly

414
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:18,769
supported to solve our own problems and

415
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:22,549
in local and voluntary leadership

416
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:26,160
and here the next three sentences

417
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:28,649
we believe in a program a definite

418
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,600
carefully considered plan of work local

419
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,130
and conception and in character which

420
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,439
looks toward the solution of the

421
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,290
problems which are vital to the welfare

422
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,000
of the farm and the home this plan of

423
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:42,389
action for the organization should be

424
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,160
made at home by those most concerned but

425
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,580
with the best expert advice and

426
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,710
assistance and then the last sentence we

427
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:51,720
believe in a partnership between farmers

428
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:54,779
and the public agricultural agencies

429
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:58,069
between practice and science for the

430
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,069
working out of this program

431
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:06,539
so these are sentences about self-help

432
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:09,299
that there's a fierce voice of

433
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:12,079
independence of you damn well better

434
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:14,279
respect us

435
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,589
because we're going to solve our own

436
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,289
problems but we want to be in some kind

437
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:22,259
of relationship best assistant

438
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:23,269
assistance best expert advice and

439
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:26,089
assistance

440
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:29,269
they're talking about a partnership

441
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:31,970
so here's the next

442
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:34,579
little artifact

443
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,509
in 1949

444
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:38,490
the history of Cornell Cooperative

445
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,769
Extension was published it was called

446
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:44,308
written by Ruby green Smith who spent

447
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:47,329
three decades as the home bureau leader

448
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:50,759
in the state of New York

449
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:53,789
and she gave it the very wonderful title

450
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,710
the people's colleges and this is just

451
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:57,629
one little this is like a 600-page book

452
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,370
which Cornell University Press has just

453
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,920
republished in the past few years I

454
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:03,279
wrote the preface for the new edition

455
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,460
it's easily available

456
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,690
very interesting history

457
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,960
so here's a passage here's a little

458
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,250
passage from that as another artifact

459
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,630
I'm just pulling this out of one of

460
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:20,650
these it's on page 544 on Facebook all

461
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:23,650
right here it is

462
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,960
extension workers need to have faith in

463
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,940
spiritual values and

464
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,769
to recognize the human relationships

465
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,730
that contribute to what the ancient

466
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:36,139
Greeks called the good life

467
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,660
they should believe that in the kinds of

468
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,820
homes farms and industries which are the

469
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,220
goals of extension service man cannot

470
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:44,779
live by bread alone

471
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,940
that it is not enough for people to have

472
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:50,029
food shelter and clothing that they

473
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:52,029
aspire also to find appreciation respect

474
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:55,730
for individuality and human dignity

475
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:59,109
affection ideals and opportunities these

476
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:02,529
are the satisfactions that belong to

477
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:02,529
democratic living

478
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:11,019
so as a

479
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:14,019
historian I I have I came into my work

480
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:16,509
being fascinated with these land grant

481
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:18,819
colleges because I was deeply interested

482
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:21,819
in the question of what is the

483
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:24,279
relationship between higher education

484
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:26,889
these colleges and universities and the

485
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:28,930
public and communities and what's which

486
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,580
quickly goes to the place of what are we

487
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,650
supposed to be doing what are we what

488
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:36,309
are these institutions do what's our

489
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:38,970
work and as I've been doing this

490
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:42,190
research now for 20 years

491
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:44,410
I've been finding this really these

492
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,710
really interesting voices that you hear

493
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:49,060
in these two passages from Cornell

494
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,470
they're not speaking about the kind of

495
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:53,399
thing we would expect to be hearing

496
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:56,740
about certainly not spiritual

497
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,740
issues about the extension agent or the

498
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,380
Extension Service what is going on in

499
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,420
these passages

500
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,620
so moving now to the next thing I said I

501
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,759
was going to talk about how do we

502
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:09,250
interpret the meaning and significance

503
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:12,039
of those two artifacts that I just

504
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,049
showed you as discoveries from my work

505
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,970
and

506
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:18,819
you know I have hundreds and hundreds of

507
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:21,730
other other discoveries like this the

508
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:23,789
sort of pattern of a way of thinking of

509
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,829
things being said

510
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:29,230
so as I mentioned this pushes us in in

511
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:32,289
really complex territory because in

512
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:34,150
order to interpret these kinds of

513
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:36,329
passages not only do we have to put them

514
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,070
in their context of their time and place

515
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:42,159
not only do we have to put them in some

516
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:44,710
kind of historical trajectory we have we

517
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,620
need tools just like you need tools to

518
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:51,160
in those of you or soil scientists to do

519
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:53,439
your analysis and work and so we use

520
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,350
tools in in the field that I work in

521
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,850
that basically as a historical

522
00:22:55,349 --> 00:23:01,719
sociologist and that sort of place in

523
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:03,669
the development sociology field we as

524
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,160
conceptual and theoretical tools and

525
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,720
frameworks to

526
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:11,110
make sense of these things in addition

527
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,110
to the historical tools

528
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,130
and

529
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:21,599
the other part of the complexity of

530
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:24,380
course here is that we're not just

531
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,379
dealing with

532
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:30,450
determining what happened it's back to

533
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:32,519
the empirical versus normative we're not

534
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,930
just determining what this person said

535
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:38,129
this thing in this year

536
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:40,380
we have to work with trying to

537
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,720
understand what were they trying to

538
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,120
argue

539
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,670
what what is the cultural significance

540
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:50,939
the larger social political significance

541
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:52,200
of what they were saying we have to we

542
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,850
have to engage in those kinds of things

543
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,069
this gets us in all kinds of trouble as

544
00:23:53,849 --> 00:24:00,359
you might imagine because we then engage

545
00:23:56,069 --> 00:24:02,579
in all the debates about difference that

546
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:04,589
that people have about the answer to

547
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:07,279
normative questions of what we should do

548
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:10,279
what we should not do

549
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:14,399
so

550
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:18,480
as I said I sparing you all the complex

551
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,550
details of the fine grain nuanced and

552
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,410
jargon Laden material that i would have

553
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:25,259
to open up to to talk about these

554
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:28,080
conceptual and theoretical frames I want

555
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:30,660
to just do something quickly to sort of

556
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,669
it as part of the work of making sense

557
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,340
of those artifacts part of it includes

558
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:37,860
going back in history because we have to

559
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:39,539
situate it in a historical trajectory so

560
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:42,629
I want to go back and then I want to go

561
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:44,430
to the present before I conclude with

562
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,810
with sort of questions and concerns out

563
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,810
of this so let me go back first

564
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:56,339
because both of those artifacts in

565
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,790
making sense of them get us to the place

566
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:01,589
where we're asking questions about

567
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:04,109
scientists in scientific institutions in

568
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:06,359
the case of those things we're talking

569
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:09,149
about Cornell's College of Agriculture

570
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:11,719
and in those days college of home

571
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:14,070
economics as well

572
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,390
we need to be thinking we need to be

573
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:18,799
thinking about a historical trajectory

574
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,800
of those institutions

575
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:23,879
so

576
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:26,220
so as I've done my historical work one

577
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,890
of the things I've seen moving back to

578
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,779
the mid 19th century is the presence of

579
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:33,640
two

580
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:35,230
that I think the work of civic science

581
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,150
and the idea of civic science has

582
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,829
brought together and continues to bring

583
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:42,040
together in its contemporary practice

584
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:44,250
even though it's mostly unnamed mostly

585
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:46,899
unfazed

586
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,099
so the first one of course has to do

587
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,830
with things that I would assume many of

588
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:53,799
you are really familiar with

589
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:56,279
and centered on and to get to this I'm

590
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:58,899
going to quote Justin Smith moral

591
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:04,170
who as many of you know was the author

592
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:07,960
of the moral Act that was passed in 1862

593
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:10,269
so I have working on a paper about his

594
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,069
vision and the vision of Jonathan

595
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:14,470
Baldwin Turner who was a contemporary of

596
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:17,399
his who many people think is the real

597
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,890
father of the land grant act um

598
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,420
so here's a passage from

599
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,300
the speech that

600
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:27,180
[Music]

601
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:29,799
Turner gave to

602
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:32,279
let's see this is 37 Congress so this

603
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:35,349
was in June of 1862

604
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:38,559
so here's jet imagine the floor of

605
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:40,389
Congress 1862 Justin Smith morals on the

606
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,789
floor and one of the things he says is

607
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:46,090
this an

608
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:49,000
American farming the land is held until

609
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:51,609
it is robbed of its virtue skimmed of

610
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,980
its cream and then the owner selling his

611
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:56,529
wasted field to some skinflint neighbor

612
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,599
flies to fresh fields with the foul

613
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:00,089
purpose to repeat the same sporulation

614
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:03,009
and

615
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:05,079
thus annual exodus which prevails over

616
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:06,640
all the older states and even begins

617
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:08,619
upon the first settlements of the new

618
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,270
states before the remoter borders have

619
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:14,589
lost sight of the savage as his language

620
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:16,599
painfully indicates that we have reached

621
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:18,220
the maximum population or land will

622
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:21,129
support on the present state of our

623
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,289
agricultural economy we bring forth new

624
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,840
states by the litter and when we want

625
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:29,710
more like our Norman ancestors we commit

626
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:31,799
grand larceny and annexed them this

627
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,690
progress seems wonderful

628
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,609
but with it appears the bitter fact that

629
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,410
these new states in half a century a

630
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:42,189
brief time in the history of the state's

631
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:44,210
become depleted and stationary this

632
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:47,330
early maturity is followed by a sudden

633
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:50,180
berenice the phrase in these days with

634
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:52,639
soil exhaustion that was the term that

635
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:55,670
they were using right so out of this he

636
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,040
paints this grim picture of basically

637
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:00,019
how the land in the in the US has been

638
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:03,470
totally destroyed by this horrendously

639
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:07,150
bad farming and then he issues what I

640
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:10,640
think of as a prophecy of doom

641
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:13,250
he says should no effort be made to

642
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,070
arrest the deterioration and spoil ation

643
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:18,079
of the soil in America while all Europe

644
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:20,179
is wisely striving to teach her

645
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,220
agriculturalists the best means of

646
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:24,769
hoarding up capital and the lands on

647
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,049
that side of the Atlantic it is easy to

648
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:29,480
see that we are doomed to be dwarfed in

649
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:31,879
national importance and not many years

650
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,670
can pass away before our ships will be

651
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,030
laden with grain not on their outward

652
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:42,230
but homeward voyage

653
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:44,629
then with cheap bread he says then with

654
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:46,789
cheap bread no longer peculiar to

655
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:49,970
America our free institutions may be

656
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:52,309
thought too dear by those of whom even

657
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,710
empires are not worthy the men with

658
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:56,569
hearts hands and brains vainly looking

659
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,059
to our shores for life liberty and the

660
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:01,819
pursuit of happiness this is the grand

661
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:04,659
political rhetoric of course we expect

662
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:04,659
to hear

663
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:12,620
so what we begin to hear of course here

664
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:16,640
is a the argument for land grant

665
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:20,199
colleges why do we need them and what we

666
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,690
also here is what their work is

667
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,360
what their job is

668
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:28,009
what the consequences of their jobs with

669
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:32,329
the meaning and significance of their

670
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:34,900
work is and that is centered mostly

671
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:38,569
around economics

672
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:40,550
but it also has an ecological dimension

673
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:42,200
there's a historian from Yale named

674
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:44,119
Stephen stole he's written a really

675
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,890
beautiful book called the larding of the

676
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:47,209
wiener

677
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,040
gorgeously written history it's a bit

678
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,670
traces the evolution of the

679
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,980
sustainability ethic in the 19th century

680
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:56,960
beautiful book so there's a presence by

681
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,839
the time he's making the statement some

682
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,220
really strong ecological thinking about

683
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,109
and many of you know this I'm sure

684
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,298
better than me the history of soil

685
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:07,990
science the history of this kind of

686
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:07,990
thinking yeah

687
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:13,970
hundred years yeah yes it's not saying

688
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:16,669
exactly the same thing she was saying

689
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:19,009
but so so we start to see this in his

690
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:21,020
rhetoric but here's one other little

691
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:23,769
thing that he says I'll just give you a

692
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,769
little nugget of

693
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:31,120
so what I think what I think moral did

694
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:33,190
is he basically he painted a picture of

695
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,048
what was happening

696
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,669
which was really was almost all negative

697
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:39,710
was really pretty much all negative he

698
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:42,140
then made this prophecy of the doom that

699
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:44,840
would bethe which he used this really

700
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,059
apocalyptic phrases about skeletons and

701
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:50,119
starvation mass starvation everything

702
00:30:47,058 --> 00:30:51,639
and then he said but he was the way we

703
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:55,759
can fix all that

704
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,470
and and his answer this is somewhat for

705
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,480
those of you this all this mythology

706
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,610
about people like moral and the land

707
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,069
grant act ppl makes frankly they just

708
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:06,048
make stuff up about it it sounds good

709
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:08,178
but when you go back and actually read

710
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:12,519
what because everybody thinks yes he was

711
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:14,538
for education no he was for science

712
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:17,859
everything everything he was talking

713
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:21,048
about was the answer is science not

714
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:22,759
not education he talked about education

715
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,558
that but frankly it was about science

716
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:26,929
but

717
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:28,788
he also said he liked everybody who's

718
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:31,059
complicated he said contradictory things

719
00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:33,259
and he said a lot of

720
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:34,940
things about different stuff and here's

721
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:37,369
one little glimpse into that so part of

722
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:39,620
what he said is that government should

723
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:41,808
aim not only to elevate and build up a

724
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:44,089
nation that is great in its resources of

725
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:46,369
wealth and power but greatest of all in

726
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:48,918
the aggregate of its intelligence and

727
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:51,469
virtue he said that effort should be

728
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:54,320
made to satisfy and elevate the manhood

729
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,538
and that word was an italic of the mass

730
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,889
of the people

731
00:31:55,538 --> 00:32:00,169
statesmen and legislators he wrote he

732
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,970
said should aid to elevate the class

733
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:03,950
upon whom they learn first lien for

734
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,259
support and upon whom they depend for

735
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:09,019
their audience

736
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:11,240
he also said that every nation should

737
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:13,579
not only be giving should be giving all

738
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,620
men must succeed not only in giving all

739
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:17,529
men quote an opportunity by their own

740
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:20,149
labor to obtain a substantial support

741
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:23,180
but also a higher and possibly more

742
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:26,840
difficult task which is to combine the

743
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:28,150
largest freedom with the largest rewards

744
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,379
of labor

745
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,540
free government and personal

746
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,460
independence

747
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:37,009
something that moral argued was key to

748
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,799
securing quote the immortality of our

749
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:42,759
Republic

750
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,869
so he's not just talking about

751
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,450
economics he's not just talking about

752
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:49,549
soil depletion and ecology he's talking

753
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,759
about something we would put have to put

754
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:56,019
under the category of culture

755
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:58,160
political culture political ideals

756
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:59,569
so part of making sense of these

757
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,769
anecdotes is going back and

758
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:05,950
understanding the ways in which the

759
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:09,019
people who build these institutions

760
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,940
worked at these institutions who were

761
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:12,650
political advocates for these

762
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,240
institutions understand what they were

763
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:16,840
supposed to be about what their work was

764
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,890
supposed to be and we find in moral

765
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:23,299
science as the centerpiece of

766
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,980
the positive thing that would have to

767
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:27,009
contribute to the world but we also find

768
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,319
all this stuff about in those days there

769
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:31,700
was a

770
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:34,759
gets into the weeds with political

771
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,529
theory but republicanism was the

772
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:38,329
political philosophy the public

773
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:41,000
philosophy that a lot of people worked

774
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:43,639
out of not democracy democracy was still

775
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,859
emerging as an idea that was seen

776
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,440
positively many of you may know that

777
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:50,000
Plato rejected democracy thought it was

778
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,490
a really terrible thing it was actually

779
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,558
asking the mob to rule which you know

780
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:57,279
was asking for mob rule so he rejected

781
00:33:54,558 --> 00:34:00,289
that and the founders of this country

782
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,200
also rejected democracy they wanted

783
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:05,089
instead a representative Republic and so

784
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,340
they were grounded in this philosophy

785
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:09,259
that scholars refer to as republicanism

786
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:11,418
civic republicanism is one of the

787
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,570
strains of that moral was in that

788
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:16,989
category and so he he paid attention to

789
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:20,450
what he referred to as virtue

790
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:23,449
and I will say to you that this is one

791
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:26,529
of the reasons why the moral act

792
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:29,348
has the sentence in it that talks about

793
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:32,510
liberal and practical education

794
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:36,200
for the industrial classes that word

795
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:39,700
liberal signified that the education was

796
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:43,668
not to be narrowly technical or

797
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:45,648
practical but liberal and practical for

798
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:46,908
reasons it had to do with the

799
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:49,969
understanding that we need to be

800
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:53,210
educating and helping to create citizens

801
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:57,309
in these days and a republic not just

802
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:59,750
technicians and here is where my next

803
00:34:57,309 --> 00:35:00,980
piece and the history comes in and I'm

804
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,909
going to be done with the history and

805
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:06,440
this comes from Liberty hi Bailey

806
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:07,659
because there's this it's situating

807
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,730
these artifacts

808
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:12,739
one historical trajectory is this whole

809
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:15,530
thing about the land-grant institution

810
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:18,379
and a lot sorry one of the whole thing

811
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:21,019
about soil exhaustion about all the

812
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:24,289
things that had to do with bad farming

813
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:27,349
and science was was was the key is the

814
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:29,358
key but the other historical brand

815
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:31,519
narrative that we need to situate those

816
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:35,230
artifacts in is a narrative about

817
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:37,969
oppression and

818
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:40,159
freedom and liberty and self-rule and

819
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:42,949
the word we use a lot today democracy

820
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:45,019
and nobody has spoken to this more

821
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:47,118
eloquently and concisely that i have

822
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:49,670
found in the period i'm looking at than

823
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,920
liberty high bailey and he did so in

824
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:53,690
many places but the most eloquently in

825
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,000
his book that was just republished last

826
00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:00,250
year for its hundredth anniversary the

827
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,909
holy earth his 1915 book

828
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:07,670
there's a passage in that book

829
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:09,409
section in the book i think it's called

830
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,030
the democratic agriculture and the

831
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:13,608
democratic basis or something like that

832
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:15,470
I've erased out the header of that

833
00:36:13,608 --> 00:36:18,170
here's what Bailey wrote in this passage

834
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:20,199
this again brings us some something into

835
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:22,789
view that is absolutely

836
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:24,649
essential for interpreting the median

837
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:26,300
significance of a farm bureau creed

838
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:28,730
artifact and the ruby green Smith

839
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,339
artifact here's a Bailey set for years

840
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,170
without number

841
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:36,980
four years that run into the centuries

842
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:38,869
when men have slaughtered men sorry when

843
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,639
men have slaughtered each other on many

844
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:43,190
fields thinking that they were on the

845
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:46,179
fields of Honor when many awful

846
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:48,530
despotisms have ground men into the dust

847
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:50,509
the despotisms thinking themselves

848
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:52,160
divine for all these years there have

849
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,530
been men on the land wishing to see the

850
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:56,259
light tried to make mankind here hoping

851
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:58,790
but never realizing

852
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,070
they have been the pawns on the great

853
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:02,989
battlefield

854
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:04,880
men taken out of the peasant trees to be

855
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:07,939
hurled against other men they did not

856
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,599
know and for no wards rewards except

857
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:13,460
further enslavement and

858
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:16,549
this next sentence goes right to Justin

859
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:19,429
moral in the land grant act they may

860
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:22,370
even have been developed to a high

861
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:25,279
degree of manual or technical skill that

862
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:27,909
they might better support governments to

863
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,910
make conquests

864
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,980
then he says they have been on the

865
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,780
bottom upholding the whole

866
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:38,240
superstructure structure and pressed

867
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,400
into the earth by the weight of it so

868
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:42,409
here's Bailey in 1915 giving us a

869
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,570
sweeping view of thousands of years of

870
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:47,539
human history and the farmer the person

871
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:51,140
on the bottom the peasant the oppression

872
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:54,590
of that person used by governments used

873
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:55,869
by kings maybe even trained technically

874
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:58,640
in

875
00:37:55,869 --> 00:38:00,789
laboratories in universities and

876
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:00,789
colleges

877
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,869
but then he he says and he's telling a

878
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:08,559
story or Bailey is doing a grand

879
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:11,989
prophetic narrative piece of work here

880
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:13,969
then he says the 19th century brought a

881
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:15,309
parting of the ways in the United States

882
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:17,809
that

883
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:20,299
force hold the end of this terrible

884
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:21,549
story of the pression narrative

885
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,500
impression

886
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:26,180
during this time Bailey wrote farmers

887
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,340
and others at the bottom began to

888
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:30,889
receive recognition not only for their

889
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,690
economic value of their work but also in

890
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:34,819
according to Bailey most important way

891
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:38,269
for their humanity and dignity and their

892
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:40,039
agency in standing as citizens in his

893
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:41,809
view this multi-dimensional recognition

894
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:43,460
was what inspired the creation of the

895
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:46,150
united states department of agriculture

896
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:49,440
in nineteen eighteen sixty two

897
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:52,019
land grant colleges in 1862 agricole

898
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,130
experiment stations in 1887 and finally

899
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:55,400
the National Cooperative Extension

900
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:59,700
system in 1914

901
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,200
quoting Bailey quote a new agency has

902
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:02,730
been created in the agricultural

903
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,289
extension act which was signed by

904
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,619
President Wilson on the eighth of May in

905
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:09,179
1914 a

906
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:10,559
new instrumentality in the world has now

907
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:13,409
received the sanction of a whole people

908
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:15,838
and it almost staggers one when one even

909
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:17,848
partly comprehends the tremendous

910
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,909
consequences that in all likelihood will

911
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:22,950
come of it

912
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:25,139
then he conceptualizing extension work

913
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:28,108
in political rather than narrowly

914
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:30,690
technical terms he pointed that the

915
00:39:28,108 --> 00:39:33,509
problem of relating quote in baileys

916
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:36,530
words all this public work to the

917
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:38,730
development of a democracy I

918
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:41,390
am not thinking so much of the

919
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:44,579
development of a form of government as

920
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:46,529
of a real democratic expression on the

921
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:48,960
part of the people agricultural is our

922
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:51,150
basic industry as we organize its

923
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,269
affairs so to a great degree shall we

924
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:55,289
secure the results in society in general

925
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:57,030
and then Bailey went on to talk about

926
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:58,650
higher education and he said hi Rick

927
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,170
average occations engagement with

928
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:03,210
farmers needed to take the form of a

929
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:06,420
democratic Association that is deeply

930
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:08,639
educated for him it was imperative that

931
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:12,000
quote education should result or

932
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:13,858
function politically this is the ex Dean

933
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,139
of a college of Agriculture this college

934
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:17,460
of agriculture perhaps has an ex Dean

935
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:19,318
he's saying he said these kinds of

936
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:22,159
things when he was still the Dean it was

937
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:22,159
1915

938
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:27,000
education to result our function

939
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:28,440
politically with respect to the kind of

940
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,969
education that should be provided by

941
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,130
land grant colleges of agriculture

942
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,750
Bailey wrote

943
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:36,240
and this goes right back to Justin moral

944
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:38,219
this is Bailey interpreting the meaning

945
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,799
and significance of the land grant act

946
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:44,358
of liberal and practical education of

947
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,650
his role as a scientist of the role of

948
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:48,598
others of his colleagues and this

949
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,849
institution this is what he's doing is

950
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,400
how I interpret what he's doing when he

951
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:55,079
wrote this

952
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,059
it is not sufficient to Train

953
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,400
technically in the trades and crafts and

954
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:01,460
arts to the end of securing greater

955
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,829
economic efficiency

956
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,139
this may be accomplished in a despotism

957
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:08,119
and

958
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:09,368
result in no self action on the part of

959
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:11,960
the people

960
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:13,579
every democracy must reach far beyond

961
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,380
what is commonly known as economic

962
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:17,929
efficiency and do everything it can to

963
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,970
enable those in the backgrounds to

964
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:22,429
maintain their standing and their pride

965
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:25,368
and to partake in the making of

966
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:27,618
political affairs now if you can't hear

967
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:29,240
the Farm Bureau Creed's words resonating

968
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:31,550
in that quote if you can't hear what

969
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:35,829
Ruby green Smith said resonating in that

970
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:38,869
quote I'll go back and read them again

971
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:42,259
so we're discovering something here

972
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:44,869
that's really interesting that speaks to

973
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:48,230
these normative questions of the role

974
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:51,170
none of this is anti science none of it

975
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:53,750
none of this is against scientists doing

976
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:55,838
work in laboratories and Bailey was a

977
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,449
fierce defender of

978
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:01,190
bass what we would call basic research

979
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:04,219
fierce defender of that he pushed back

980
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:06,730
very hard against what he were thought

981
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:09,709
of as the totally irresponsible

982
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:12,079
demand by politicians and by the public

983
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:13,338
that everything scientists did at these

984
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,429
institutions that have immediate

985
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:19,429
practical usability he pushed back very

986
00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:21,108
hard against that because he said every

987
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:23,139
creation of knowledge is a contribution

988
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:25,880
to our Commonwealth

989
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:27,129
and other reasons why he was against

990
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,809
that

991
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,670
so

992
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:34,150
I

993
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:36,108
got years of work I'm doing in

994
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:38,838
interpreting all this and tried to

995
00:42:36,108 --> 00:42:41,690
develop this idea out of this history

996
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:43,969
and heritage of thinking at work going

997
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,500
back to the 19th century but it comes

998
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:47,029
into the present what I'm talking about

999
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,480
and that's what I want to so I'm going

1000
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:53,000
to quote you for a second but the for

1001
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,940
quoting you so I I in students and I

1002
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,889
have done a lot of I

1003
00:42:54,940 --> 00:43:01,250
become fascinated with all of this not

1004
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:04,750
just as some thing to read in the

1005
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:07,760
archives people who are no longer living

1006
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:10,219
but wondering wow that all of this is in

1007
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,859
the DNA of these institutions I wonder

1008
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:15,329
if that's still happening today I wonder

1009
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:17,519
if do we have people saying some our

1010
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:21,079
things who are scientists like Bailey

1011
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:23,519
was or administrators what are people

1012
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:26,670
how do people today talk about their

1013
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:30,570
work what is the work that scientists at

1014
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:33,119
institutions like Cornell are doing when

1015
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:34,530
they're out beyond the campus so we've

1016
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,740
been I've been spending years doing

1017
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:40,950
these oral history interviews finding

1018
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:42,569
engaged scientists and inviting them to

1019
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:45,029
sell stories about their work and

1020
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:46,940
experience about their lives how they

1021
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:49,230
became an engaged scientist

1022
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:51,539
so I published several books of

1023
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:53,389
collections of these things with

1024
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:55,588
analysis and interpretation

1025
00:43:53,389 --> 00:43:58,289
one of my favorites which is unpublished

1026
00:43:55,588 --> 00:43:59,269
because the Don world when we publish it

1027
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:02,670
yet

1028
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:04,440
is a weed scientist one of your friends

1029
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,730
may be named Don Weiss from the

1030
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:10,108
University of Minnesota is anybody know

1031
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:11,338
down wife you know that way so I just

1032
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:14,369
want to read a couple of passages from

1033
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:16,829
his profile which I which begins to help

1034
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:18,809
us move beyond just kind of the idea of

1035
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:21,179
civic science and but what does it look

1036
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:22,858
like in practice what are the elements

1037
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:24,919
of practice and civic science what a

1038
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:27,000
civic scientists do

1039
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,769
what am i sup with that one of the heck

1040
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,199
am I talking about basically you know or

1041
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:34,349
would beyond some philosophical thing

1042
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:35,669
that has grandiose pneus to it so here's

1043
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:38,940
like two passages i want to read from

1044
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:40,559
Don's profile and he invited him to tell

1045
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,000
his life story how did you end up as a

1046
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,920
weed scientist at the University of

1047
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Minnesota where did you grow up so he

1048
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,970
grew up as a Mennonite on a farm in Ohio

1049
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,949
raised by Mennonite parents but he got

1050
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:55,319
all the way to the place in his story

1051
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:56,819
where he was talking about his getting

1052
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,160
the job at the University of Minnesota

1053
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,660
so I read you just a passage from from

1054
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:04,069
that when I arrived here at the

1055
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:06,108
University of Minnesota which was in

1056
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:08,190
1974

1057
00:45:06,108 --> 00:45:10,500
when I arrived here at the University of

1058
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:13,409
Minnesota the position i got had two

1059
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,119
obligations it was an 8020 split twenty

1060
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:17,639
percent teaching so that meant I would

1061
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,140
be teaching two courses my primary

1062
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:21,989
responsibility in teaching was to teach

1063
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:23,519
the undergrad weed management course at

1064
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:26,069
that time the student population was

1065
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:27,838
about 80 to 120 students the other

1066
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:31,740
obligation which I found very intriguing

1067
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:34,349
was the 80 % research I had no extension

1068
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:36,058
our outreach component officially result

1069
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:38,309
the research component was to work on

1070
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:40,460
perennial weed management and grass seed

1071
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:42,539
production in northern Minnesota

1072
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:44,068
although I did have the opportunity to

1073
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:46,020
work on perennial weed management and

1074
00:45:44,068 --> 00:45:48,088
other cropping systems statewide my

1075
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:50,400
primary responsibility was to work with

1076
00:45:48,088 --> 00:45:52,710
a group of farmers in Roseau and Lake of

1077
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,150
the Woods counties and a series of other

1078
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,159
border kept bordering counties on

1079
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,769
perennial weed management in legume and

1080
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:00,088
seed production

1081
00:45:57,769 --> 00:46:01,920
the University of Minnesota College of

1082
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:03,420
Agriculture specifically the Department

1083
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,250
of agronomy and plant genetics had

1084
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,869
developed a relationship with the area

1085
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,969
of the state that goes back a number of

1086
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:11,400
years probably back to the late 40s and

1087
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:13,048
early 50s there was a group of

1088
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,700
scientists from the st. Paul campus who

1089
00:46:13,048 --> 00:46:16,250
were breeding grasses and leg and

1090
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:18,689
legumes

1091
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,429
it just so happened that at the time

1092
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,260
some students from northern Minnesota

1093
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:24,028
were attending the st. Paul campus and

1094
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,980
had been taking some courses and and

1095
00:46:24,028 --> 00:46:27,778
learned about these breeding programs

1096
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:29,278
and found that one of the faculty had

1097
00:46:27,778 --> 00:46:30,588
developed a series of varieties of

1098
00:46:29,278 --> 00:46:32,969
bluegrass

1099
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:35,278
I'm Way out of my depth here talking

1100
00:46:32,969 --> 00:46:37,108
about what he's talking about so I'm

1101
00:46:35,278 --> 00:46:39,449
just reading you what he said one of

1102
00:46:37,108 --> 00:46:41,338
them was called Park Park Kentucky

1103
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:42,989
bluegrass in the interaction that the

1104
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:44,730
faculty members had with the students

1105
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:45,929
from that area of the state they decided

1106
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:48,289
that they would try some of these

1107
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:51,028
grasses in northern Minnesota

1108
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:52,349
first the climate was ideal for growth

1109
00:46:51,028 --> 00:46:54,659
and development of Kentucky bluegrass

1110
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:56,130
plus the community and the students were

1111
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:58,108
interested in bringing that crop to the

1112
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:00,059
area of the state because of his risking

1113
00:46:58,108 --> 00:47:02,219
the riskiness in producing annual crops

1114
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:04,140
so in the late 40s relationships of

1115
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:06,088
developed and Kentucky bluegrass seed

1116
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:08,278
production started in that area my

1117
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:10,469
position was created as a result of

1118
00:47:08,278 --> 00:47:12,989
trying to expand grasp legumes seed

1119
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:15,598
production in to other species other

1120
00:47:12,989 --> 00:47:17,009
than Kentucky bluegrass now he talks

1121
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,230
about the problem with expanding that

1122
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:20,339
the reason they wanted that person to

1123
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,889
deal with that problem had do with

1124
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:24,900
reducing the risks then he says a group

1125
00:47:22,889 --> 00:47:27,058
of farmers had organized called the

1126
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,740
northern Minnesota bluegrass producers

1127
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:30,180
they developed around this initial

1128
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:32,788
opportunity created by the University to

1129
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:34,318
produce Kentucky bluegrass they then

1130
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:36,089
wanted to move forward to create new

1131
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,920
opportunities they had organized to ask

1132
00:47:36,088 --> 00:47:39,929
the experiment station and through the

1133
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,730
experiment stations of legislature to

1134
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:44,368
create this new position

1135
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,929
his faculty position so it was pretty

1136
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:47,460
well set up ahead of time that the core

1137
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:48,809
group that I would interact with and

1138
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,880
northern Minnesota was this loose-knit

1139
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:51,840
group of seed producers when I

1140
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,519
interviewed at the University of

1141
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,200
Minnesota I interviewed not only on this

1142
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,570
campus I interviewed him on the campus

1143
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:00,029
but also interviewed with those farmers

1144
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:02,880
and those farmers had direct input into

1145
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:05,369
my selection so I didn't develop this

1146
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,230
network I was brought in as part of this

1147
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:09,329
network that had developed years before

1148
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:12,000
my arrival I was brought in as one who

1149
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:13,739
could fit into that philosophy and be

1150
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,449
willing to work in that community and

1151
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:18,059
help them develop these new economic

1152
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:21,929
opportunities so here's a little glimpse

1153
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:25,579
of the historical reality it's a little

1154
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:28,529
moment in time one person's career

1155
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:31,769
as I've researched across institutions

1156
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:34,109
around the country this is in again in

1157
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:36,090
the DNA of these colleges this

1158
00:48:34,108 --> 00:48:38,608
relationship here's a scientist whose

1159
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:41,119
whole position is grounded and defined

1160
00:48:38,608 --> 00:48:43,909
in relationship to pacific place

1161
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:47,130
specific people

1162
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:49,829
so what becomes important is what is

1163
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:52,108
Don's work and donna is a good friend of

1164
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:53,279
mine he was a director of mesa the

1165
00:48:52,108 --> 00:48:55,230
minnesota institute for sustainable

1166
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,700
agricultural i was doing my PhD in

1167
00:48:55,230 --> 00:49:02,670
minnesota and he's a real smartass joker

1168
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:05,608
and he has the habit of always saying

1169
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:08,780
i'm just a weed scientist but he's not

1170
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:11,880
just a weed scientist he's he's fiercely

1171
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:15,060
engaged in the world and in his field

1172
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:18,000
and the institution and you know he's

1173
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:19,920
he's a philosopher he's a civic educator

1174
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,960
he's all kinds of stuff so I want to

1175
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,059
read one more passage brief passage that

1176
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,480
begins to give us a glimpse into his

1177
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:29,279
practice and it and I would I'm naming

1178
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,900
this as Civic science you could name it

1179
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,570
anything you want but I'm naming it a

1180
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,519
civic science in with respect to this

1181
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:39,300
whole set of discoveries that I'm making

1182
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,650
and the tools i'm using to analyze it so

1183
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,800
he's just giving us now a little glimpse

1184
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:46,050
into what he does know each spring we

1185
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,810
not just my project but Nancy elke was

1186
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:50,700
reported one of his other colleagues fly

1187
00:49:48,809 --> 00:49:52,349
to northern Minnesota and spend two days

1188
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:54,478
with the farmers and other members of

1189
00:49:52,349 --> 00:49:55,950
community I need to emphasize that the

1190
00:49:54,478 --> 00:49:57,538
network of people that supports the

1191
00:49:55,949 --> 00:49:59,699
grass seed industry or university

1192
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:02,609
personnel extension with in northern

1193
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:04,558
Minnesota as well as bankers processors

1194
00:50:02,608 --> 00:50:06,509
and community members so it's a very

1195
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,609
broad set of players who are active in

1196
00:50:06,509 --> 00:50:09,900
helping set the agenda and providing

1197
00:50:08,608 --> 00:50:12,028
leadership for the research and

1198
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,950
education program each spring we get to

1199
00:50:12,028 --> 00:50:16,108
each spring in March we get together we

1200
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:17,848
go through a two-day discussion which is

1201
00:50:16,108 --> 00:50:20,130
made up of presentations discussion and

1202
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:22,289
future planning so the research agenda

1203
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,509
that I carry out is not just my research

1204
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:25,859
agenda

1205
00:50:23,509 --> 00:50:29,068
it is a research agenda that has been

1206
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:32,009
developed I would say even approved by

1207
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:33,989
this network of people it becomes my

1208
00:50:32,009 --> 00:50:35,608
obligation to carry out that work in

1209
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,978
partnership with them as well as to

1210
00:50:35,608 --> 00:50:40,139
report back to them help facilitate the

1211
00:50:37,978 --> 00:50:41,939
conversation around results and help

1212
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:43,618
them provide the leadership for taking

1213
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,970
next steps and the next series of

1214
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:46,920
research questions which should then be

1215
00:50:44,969 --> 00:50:48,259
carried out to answer questions for that

1216
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,450
community

1217
00:50:48,259 --> 00:50:53,009
of course there's a wide range of

1218
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:55,710
interest in that setting we have

1219
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:57,150
individuals who want to sell inputs so

1220
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:58,619
they would like to see cropping systems

1221
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:01,410
develop that use of certain specific

1222
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:04,229
inputs why so they could make a profit

1223
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:06,659
selling those inputs such as herbicide

1224
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:07,978
fertilizers etc we have a set of

1225
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:09,239
processors and marketers who are

1226
00:51:07,978 --> 00:51:11,699
interested in getting seed from the

1227
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:13,349
farmer to process charging the farmer

1228
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:15,328
for processing and then taking the seed

1229
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:17,400
and marketing it we have the farmers who

1230
00:51:15,329 --> 00:51:18,839
want to control the processing and want

1231
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,479
to have a greater piece of the pie of

1232
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:23,130
marketing so you have a full array of

1233
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:24,868
interest it basically comes down to

1234
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:26,910
facilitating this group of people in a

1235
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:29,640
way that they continue to remember why

1236
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:31,259
they are doing this work this work is

1237
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:33,268
being done to add stability to that

1238
00:51:31,259 --> 00:51:34,489
community to really develop sustainable

1239
00:51:33,268 --> 00:51:36,689
systems

1240
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:38,400
so the conversations that we've had over

1241
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:40,139
the years really come back when these

1242
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,579
issues develop to remind them of what

1243
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:43,818
we're trying to accomplish together

1244
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:45,769
that's been part of my primary

1245
00:51:43,818 --> 00:51:48,538
responsibility I

1246
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:52,228
remind them why they created these

1247
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:54,420
positions dr. Ellen's position Nancy L

1248
00:51:52,228 --> 00:51:57,960
Keys position and my position in the

1249
00:51:54,420 --> 00:52:00,059
first place I have told them that and

1250
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,829
had that open up the conversation it is

1251
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:04,619
a group that allows that to happen I

1252
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:05,829
remind them that many of them are are in

1253
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:07,660
that community because of this

1254
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:09,369
relationship that has developed between

1255
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:11,399
that community community and the

1256
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:14,470
University of Minnesota

1257
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:17,410
all of that came out when i did when i

1258
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:19,618
said to don because i knew him you're

1259
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:22,389
just a technician oh

1260
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:23,769
you your weed scientist technician all

1261
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:26,318
you do is you go out to the community

1262
00:52:23,768 --> 00:52:27,548
with a clipboard and you say what are

1263
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:28,659
your problems what do you what do you

1264
00:52:27,548 --> 00:52:30,608
need what do you want and then you go

1265
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:31,778
back to your lab and you just cook up

1266
00:52:30,608 --> 00:52:33,900
the answers and then you give them

1267
00:52:31,778 --> 00:52:37,900
through that's all you do I

1268
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:40,539
sometimes use this strategy and doing

1269
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,650
interviews but only if I build some

1270
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:43,950
level of trust because it's

1271
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:46,960
disrespectful if you don't do that

1272
00:52:43,949 --> 00:52:49,719
but I knew I knew because I knew him

1273
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,278
that that was not all he was doing that

1274
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:54,189
he is not just a technician with a

1275
00:52:51,278 --> 00:52:57,159
clipboard and you hear it in what he and

1276
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:59,380
his response he reminds them of why are

1277
00:52:57,159 --> 00:53:02,969
we here what are we doing he's conscious

1278
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:05,140
of the differences in interests and

1279
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:07,899
for God's sake this is the first time i

1280
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:10,199
discovered that weed scientists were

1281
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:13,289
civic educators

1282
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:16,449
that they knew that

1283
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:18,278
they it's ingrained in him and it comes

1284
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:20,199
this goes all the way through the

1285
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:22,420
history of these institution and by the

1286
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:24,939
way none of this is perfect it's deeply

1287
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:28,180
flawed Don Weiss is not some perfection

1288
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:30,219
her heroic figure up on a pedestal all

1289
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:32,679
of this is imperfect it's in completely

1290
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:33,298
done it's messy and all that kind of

1291
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:36,518
stuff

1292
00:53:33,298 --> 00:53:38,588
but what we see here is a practice of

1293
00:53:36,518 --> 00:53:40,088
civic science in which scientists and by

1294
00:53:38,588 --> 00:53:41,978
the way Donna's produce hundreds and

1295
00:53:40,088 --> 00:53:44,078
hundreds of published articles in the

1296
00:53:41,978 --> 00:53:45,248
top journals in his field and gotten

1297
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,859
hundreds of millions of dollars of

1298
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:50,108
funding so it's not a either you do this

1299
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:53,108
stuff or you do the science not an

1300
00:53:50,108 --> 00:53:56,048
either/or it doesn't mean that Don does

1301
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:57,298
everything you have partners who do

1302
00:53:56,048 --> 00:53:58,869
that's why you have the extension

1303
00:53:57,298 --> 00:54:02,619
facilitators in the local community

1304
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:04,420
there's an ecology that's required to do

1305
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:08,700
this Civic science work so now I want to

1306
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:08,700
get into my closing here to just say

1307
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:15,248
out of what I've I'm just in the middle

1308
00:54:13,298 --> 00:54:16,748
of this work so I'm sort of dumping out

1309
00:54:15,248 --> 00:54:18,159
all the stuff that I'm discovery and

1310
00:54:16,748 --> 00:54:20,739
trying to make sense of it in real time

1311
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:22,088
here but certainly what emerges and this

1312
00:54:20,739 --> 00:54:25,288
are a set of challenges and questions

1313
00:54:22,088 --> 00:54:27,308
that I want a name very briefly the

1314
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:28,930
first one of course that a lot of people

1315
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:31,000
named when thinking about this this

1316
00:54:28,929 --> 00:54:34,139
tradition of work in land grant colleges

1317
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:38,159
is money right

1318
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:40,929
capacity I've been at Cornell since 1999

1319
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:43,389
people like Heidi in the back and and

1320
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:45,159
and others in this room can tell you who

1321
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:47,920
have been here longer than me we have

1322
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:49,929
lost faculty we have lost capacity in

1323
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,298
this institution to work with people in

1324
00:54:49,929 --> 00:54:54,308
the state of New York they've lost it in

1325
00:54:52,298 --> 00:54:56,920
Minnesota they've lost it in a lot of

1326
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:58,829
other states public disinvestment in

1327
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:02,769
higher education has

1328
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:05,410
eroded the the tradition of civic

1329
00:55:02,768 --> 00:55:08,679
science of science scientific work

1330
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:10,149
engaged with like Don's work and Don

1331
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:11,889
tells a story about when he started his

1332
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:13,599
job all the money he got from the

1333
00:55:11,889 --> 00:55:15,298
experiment station and it was enough as

1334
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,619
he put it to run a show

1335
00:55:15,298 --> 00:55:19,239
he could run a lab he could open a lab

1336
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:22,990
up on what I gotten any talks about how

1337
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:23,848
today you don't get that so you got to

1338
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:26,768
go to

1339
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:28,450
industry and that opens up a whole set

1340
00:55:26,768 --> 00:55:30,189
of challenges so money is an issue it's

1341
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:32,288
a challenge public disinvestment loss of

1342
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:34,900
capacity but this isn't just about

1343
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:37,200
capacity and now I'm just going to give

1344
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:42,568
you the tip of a very big complex and

1345
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:44,710
deeply contest a deeply I

1346
00:55:42,568 --> 00:55:47,788
want to say controversial that its

1347
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:50,849
controversial for a lot of people in

1348
00:55:47,789 --> 00:55:54,759
different ways so

1349
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:57,869
divisive well I don't know it's not just

1350
00:55:54,759 --> 00:55:57,869
about capacity it's about

1351
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,639
the way that scientists are trained the

1352
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,699
political influences on science and

1353
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:10,440
scientific institutions there's a woman

1354
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:13,118
named Stephanie Lee who is a development

1355
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:15,789
scholar she's an anthropologist and a

1356
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,640
lot of work in Southeast Asia she wrote

1357
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:20,019
a book called the will to improvement

1358
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:21,900
will to improve sorry I think it's

1359
00:56:20,018 --> 00:56:26,409
called a world home brew

1360
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:30,369
and she talked about two practices that

1361
00:56:26,409 --> 00:56:32,980
are central to the realm of development

1362
00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:34,289
work and by the way land aunt work his

1363
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:36,760
development work

1364
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:38,079
in the 19th century what they were doing

1365
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,180
is they're trying to change the way

1366
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,500
farming is being done and trying to

1367
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:43,108
change the way people are eating change

1368
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,940
the way people raising their kids

1369
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:47,980
its development work right so there's

1370
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:50,409
two practices she is identified in her

1371
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:52,530
work both of which are anti civic

1372
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:55,059
science and

1373
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:56,890
they're parallel there come their

1374
00:56:55,059 --> 00:56:59,608
companion practices one of them she

1375
00:56:56,889 --> 00:57:03,059
refers to as rendering technical and

1376
00:56:59,608 --> 00:57:05,940
the other one she refers to as

1377
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:08,920
rendering non-political

1378
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:11,079
so to summarize a very complex story

1379
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,300
what this means is you come into a

1380
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:15,279
situation that is multi-dimensional

1381
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,630
there's all kinds of stuff happening

1382
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,220
like just think about the two northern

1383
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:19,720
counties in northern Minnesota that we

1384
00:57:18,219 --> 00:57:21,429
got a glimpse of in Don's message

1385
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:22,709
there's all kinds of political and

1386
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:25,649
cultural and economic

1387
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:28,389
things happening and

1388
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:31,450
this process of rendering technical is

1389
00:57:28,389 --> 00:57:33,279
to strip all that out and say this is

1390
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:34,569
not a problem of politics up here

1391
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,500
there's just a problem of science of

1392
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:39,450
science technical science

1393
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:42,550
and

1394
00:57:39,449 --> 00:57:44,559
surprise when you do that it then the

1395
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:46,900
technician is able to provide the answer

1396
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,519
hey I got the answer for that if you

1397
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,730
leave the politics and stuff in they

1398
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:53,679
don't have the answer

1399
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:55,210
so when you rent when you do this when

1400
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,699
you render something technical when you

1401
00:57:55,210 --> 00:58:00,820
render it non-political you simplify it

1402
00:57:57,699 --> 00:58:04,598
and we all know this you simplify it too

1403
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:06,940
much you have suddenly produced a real

1404
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:08,920
problem and your intervention is going

1405
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:10,659
to be a real problem this is this is I

1406
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,970
said this is a divisive or controversial

1407
00:58:10,659 --> 00:58:14,409
whatever a lot of you know this is

1408
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:17,739
basically he's pointing the finger at

1409
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:19,449
institutions like our College and if you

1410
00:58:17,739 --> 00:58:21,699
loo do the history and stuff you can see

1411
00:58:19,449 --> 00:58:23,559
the ways in which the college if you

1412
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:26,889
know this big expanse of thinking of

1413
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:28,210
Bailey Ruby green Smith has flattened we

1414
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:31,088
don't hear this kind of stuff anymore

1415
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:32,800
and in all kinds of reasons why it's not

1416
00:58:31,088 --> 00:58:34,929
just about people being bad people this

1417
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,760
is a complicated thing this is what we

1418
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:39,730
do in my field is really trying to

1419
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:41,109
understand that use robust tools to be

1420
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:43,559
able to do that so that's another

1421
00:58:41,108 --> 00:58:43,559
problem

1422
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:47,550
there's another reality that's really

1423
00:58:46,409 --> 00:58:49,639
important is that we don't have very

1424
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:53,480
good public cultures in these colleges

1425
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:56,639
or in our fields for that matter a

1426
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:59,070
lot of our a lot of what we do is based

1427
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,569
on a theory of change bets we're making

1428
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:04,430
if we do these things that this will

1429
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:07,559
happen if we assembly in firm ation

1430
00:59:04,429 --> 00:59:11,509
parents will raise their kids better or

1431
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:13,949
eat better or whatever and

1432
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:16,830
those theories of change need to be

1433
00:59:13,949 --> 00:59:18,889
subject to critical evaluation how well

1434
00:59:16,829 --> 00:59:21,269
is that working out

1435
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:22,829
we don't have very good public cultures

1436
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:25,320
in these institutions where we create

1437
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:27,119
spaces to really engage around them or

1438
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:31,110
to hold each other accountable for more

1439
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:33,059
than just the technical piece and this

1440
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:34,559
it takes time this pushes against

1441
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:36,119
cultures in disciplines and fields

1442
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,789
there's all kinds of reasons why this is

1443
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:41,429
a challenge

1444
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:43,529
there's also a problem with with overly

1445
00:59:41,429 --> 00:59:45,750
ideological politics and morally

1446
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:49,200
righteous politics which tends to

1447
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:50,670
polarize these kinds of things here I

1448
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,189
come right back to the election where I

1449
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,750
started you know instead of instead of

1450
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:57,360
creating a space where we can hear

1451
00:59:54,750 --> 01:00:00,449
across lines a difference and speak to

1452
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:04,200
it respectfully but also critically we

1453
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:05,759
have a we have a sort of zero-sum these

1454
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:07,559
people are totally right and good and

1455
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,550
these people are totally bad and evil

1456
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:12,809
that is death to civic science

1457
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:14,490
because citic science is really grounded

1458
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:17,400
here's where my own bias comes in a more

1459
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:18,569
of democratic populist politics so I'm

1460
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,130
going to stop here that's a little

1461
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:23,730
glimpse and all as I went too long and

1462
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:23,730
I'm sorry about that well

1463
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:33,550
this has been a production of Cornell

1464
