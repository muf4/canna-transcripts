1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,850
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,710
University today I'm gonna talk about

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:09,599
you know like a joy since I've been

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,669
actually looking back genome editing

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,780
ever sings to someone lying at the post

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:17,189
or almost 10 years I just cannot imagine

7
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:19,198
but today I were really gonna share some

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,449
result after you don't have as P I you

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,880
know in past few years a lot of exciting

10
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,490
you know progress just share some

11
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:29,608
results with you so overall my lab is

12
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:31,678
really are working on sort of a genome

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,649
editing but we actually extend that more

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:37,019
than genome editing so we actually also

15
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:38,969
engineer sort of engineer Synthetica

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,190
transferring activator repressors to ten

17
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,629
oh and turn off genes which are have

18
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:46,439
their own advantage compared to existing

19
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,909
technologies so and we start a little

20
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,979
bit I don't want to talk anything about

21
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:52,140
this yet it's very preliminary we also

22
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,549
want to do epigenome editing to change

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,590
the you know the epigenetic mark of

24
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:58,890
histone modification DNA methylation and

25
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,600
but you have to keep in mind that the in

26
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,670
the end you know even these epigenome

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,769
attitudes here you wanna change the

28
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,239
expression so rather I think making

29
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,340
synthetic air you know just regulator

30
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,709
isn't is there a motorway so but again

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,810
giving today's topic kind of time I

32
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,099
actually gonna limit my talk on genome

33
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,390
editing we can talk more if you're

34
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,250
interested in later we can communicate

35
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,450
on this this topic

36
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,519
alright so for genome editing so to

37
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,079
achieve that it's rather easy to start

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,868
because you have to start thinking about

39
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,298
can you engineer a very specific or

40
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:31,920
tailor-made a scissor I quoted magicka

41
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,170
molecular scissor to my daughter for

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,030
example explain that why it's magic

43
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,040
because you can engineer that to

44
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,000
recognize any DNA sequence as you wish

45
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,740
in the genome

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,099
whether it's mo genome in out across a

47
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:46,078
huge genome like in wheat and so so that

48
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,629
has been a problem we call sequence

49
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,519
specific nucleus because you know that's

50
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:52,349
involved a lot of protein engineering

51
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,899
how can you engineer because DNA

52
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:57,809
sequence change letters right so that

53
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,820
has been a big big problem until lately

54
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,500
when I like stop ten years ago you know

55
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,419
or little more than that people have

56
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,590
making some progress but after you make

57
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,478
Tom's jump break with whatever scissor

58
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,459
you have really that literally just

59
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,840
introduced Thomas from break so DNA

60
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,840
double strand break is a very laser

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,620
damage of DNA so compare other breaks so

62
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,719
it has to be

63
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,769
hair immediately before the sale cycle

64
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:22,019
can be continuing and replicating DNA

65
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:23,189
can continue so so two pathways one is

66
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,750
only actually a pathway called a

67
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,489
non-homeless and adjoining pathway which

68
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,139
literally just sticking together stitch

69
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,060
together you know eventually using like

70
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:33,089
is like like it's flowing like is the

71
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,789
broken DNA together the the pathway in

72
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,189
fact I can argue is very precise okay so

73
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:40,289
you wouldn't make mutation but if you

74
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,639
make precise repair and it can be

75
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:43,408
recognized by the same scissor again

76
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,628
it's gonna cut again and making you know

77
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:47,878
repair many runs the runs of discount

78
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:49,798
singalong and eventually and you will

79
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:51,239
make error make mutations so that's how

80
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:52,829
you introducing their insertions

81
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,390
modulations that's how you're not

82
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:56,129
coaching many of you I think in audience

83
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,259
can use a technology no coaching

84
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:00,389
nowadays and for reverse genetics or

85
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,669
other purpose so but another pathway

86
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,108
which kind of used mine early sort of

87
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:06,149
whirring humans as well as in higher

88
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:09,030
prices for the homologous recombination

89
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,430
or homology directed repair HDR this

90
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,739
pathway typically is used in homeless

91
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,109
chromosome or histo chromatin stiff

92
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,500
series replicating and to repair

93
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:21,359
precisely the broken DNA and but we can

94
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,789
sort of were taken about into this

95
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,769
repair pathway by providing a door no

96
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:27,388
more ocular which share sort of homology

97
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,250
on the left and right then what's

98
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,079
worrying between the green stuff

99
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,000
highlighted DNA sequence can be inserted

100
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:34,799
copied into the information which really

101
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,180
representing the precise genome editing

102
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,700
so when we talk about precise genome

103
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,980
editing we more rest we're referring to

104
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,659
this kind of pathway unfortunately this

105
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,548
is really the pathway has been hard to

106
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:48,090
achieve because it has been utilized

107
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:49,439
there minor in the serve so when I first

108
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,848
started of course this is a question we

109
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,340
kind of want to kind of try to overcome

110
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:55,138
and if you think about genetically you

111
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,609
know if you can block this pathway and

112
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:59,250
let you pass by making some mutation of

113
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:01,230
the gene in this pathway probably gonna

114
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,818
shift the pathway to a yes so there's a

115
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:05,488
kind of one-way when I even as poster I

116
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:06,899
did it knowing at the time we are not

117
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,819
really lucky as you guys have Swiss per

118
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,849
we only have linking a nucleus so we

119
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:14,098
engineer zinc finger nucleus Tutera gene

120
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:16,199
in the background of Koscielny cous

121
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:18,538
Emily and equate aging are just really a

122
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,579
the Jing are involving this an HD

123
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:22,108
pathway and now in the coup 70

124
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,418
background which means an HD pathways

125
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,639
abolished and we indeed we found

126
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:27,180
actually and we use the same finger to

127
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,000
stimulate

128
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,500
the repair of HDR and in DD we found HDR

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,779
frequency has jumped at tenfold higher

130
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,100
but even that is the single digit

131
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:38,109
and this is a story being done in

132
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,670
protoplasts which means o matic sir not

133
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,500
really German lying whether we can

134
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,199
achieve that you know like a genome

135
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,019
edited HDR plant you still open question

136
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,899
I was saved at to the very late in this

137
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:52,299
talk to mention this again how can we

138
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:55,359
achieve HDR plant which are germline

139
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,210
transmittable all right so so start from

140
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,730
zinc finger nucleus and then later on we

141
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:02,349
have tannin which is again the the lab I

142
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,330
worked with John Waters group along with

143
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,010
other the invented Talent Technology and

144
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:07,719
but that really still stays very long

145
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:10,149
and later on being replaced by Chris

146
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,610
podcast a cast nigh and more recently we

147
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:14,679
have CRISPR CTF one so for the sake of

148
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,449
today's time I really gonna skip all my

149
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,160
earlier work with zinc finger talent

150
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:21,639
rather give you some taste of Chris

151
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,130
podcast and Christmas EPF so when I

152
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,729
start my own group in North Korea I see

153
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:27,550
you first

154
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,470
whistling searching either my first or

155
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,478
Levi's joined the lab so at the time

156
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,220
just happened to be Chris podcast 9 has

157
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:36,849
to be already become a proven technology

158
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,830
I even pass with some 13 so that's so

159
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,810
but from there we look at as amoeba I

160
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:42,269
look at what can be done we found a lot

161
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,439
of nothing can be further improved

162
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:46,418
researchers ask you need a better tool

163
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:48,728
so that's kind of a motivate us to do a

164
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:50,829
one topic you this which is here we

165
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:53,860
develop system called a PCR free

166
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:56,079
assembly of market expertise system the

167
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,600
system rather simple and basically what

168
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,699
you end up having a sort of different

169
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,860
step you have a module of guide RNA

170
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:05,259
which you can basically start with a

171
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,538
pair illegal which you can order you

172
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:11,019
know and then you can be you insert that

173
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:12,699
into a vector each vector is modular we

174
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:14,769
can you know depending how many sites

175
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:16,269
you want to target and if you have three

176
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:18,219
sites you have three guide on a

177
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:19,589
different free module and using one

178
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,700
single step of building it groaning

179
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:23,829
together a quarter guide on expression

180
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:26,560
vector this guide on expression vector

181
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:28,300
is now is also gateway compatible vector

182
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,550
so now we can utilize all the resources

183
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,530
at hand research community have occurred

184
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,509
over the years of the gateway vector you

185
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,859
all have in the lab and then because

186
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,599
gateway vector allow you to have

187
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,699
different promoter which is pro to

188
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,680
promoter which can be inducible you know

189
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:45,158
also consider t'v or tissue specific

190
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,019
right so this promoter can now hook to

191
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:48,579
drive different caste nine for example

192
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:50,348
we have entry and chrome which have

193
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:52,810
Oh countess 9 which are codon optimize

194
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:55,269
the form on foot I caught human or

195
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,620
anything or a custom Iong derivative or

196
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:58,810
you know gene repression or activation

197
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,030
now you can really have them Oh in this

198
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,918
sector now just three way k2 in reaction

199
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:05,378
right you can put them together this

200
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:07,389
this is entering chrome this is to enter

201
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:09,158
guide a guide on ancient Cologne cast na

202
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,870
engine chrome the destination vector

203
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:12,788
always different promoter now you're

204
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,009
making a single T DNA you know deliver

205
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:17,228
using typical agro transformation this

206
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:18,490
is how you work with this I'm quickly we

207
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,680
we have to demonstrate that when we

208
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,038
publish papers how it works and we for

209
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,439
example

210
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,598
asama free guide RNA and to targeting

211
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,038
one gene to make a deletion and one just

212
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,769
making a single knock out this crouching

213
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,120
in a post case we can show cheese yellow

214
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:33,549
crack you can have phenotype which means

215
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,459
by alan ik knockouts very efficient and

216
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,168
then we also this is mike robbery to

217
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:41,500
cruz cavite humans and group in china so

218
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:44,079
we also wanna you know use that for

219
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,879
other things for example what i showed

220
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,378
you here is coding gene protein coding

221
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,990
gene what about non coding gene like

222
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:51,580
small RNA or micro managing or or long

223
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,500
non-coding RNA gene because that would

224
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:55,389
renewed a recent interest in this kind

225
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,649
of area right so so we actually have

226
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,168
evidence in this paper if you are

227
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:00,698
interested so we we show that even by

228
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:03,278
introducing a small one base pair

229
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:05,080
insertion deletion in micron EG actually

230
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:07,240
likely you're not gonna abort the

231
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:09,068
function micron is still gonna work so

232
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,288
the one safe way to actually knock out

233
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:13,300
micron a gene is actually a conduct

234
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:15,399
deletion by using double strand break at

235
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,139
this big five and three prime end of

236
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:19,179
this gene and making her chunk of

237
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:22,750
deletion now you can really make sure to

238
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:31,329
leave the micro energy and we did the

239
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:33,129
time up alright so deletion now you have

240
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:35,110
a six day you know you have sixty

241
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:36,668
percent right people 20 lying it can see

242
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,408
any of you have 12 deletion happen right

243
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:40,208
it's very efficient and this one is 20

244
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:42,490
percent but still it's very achievable

245
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,899
writing rice this is rice making

246
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,579
deletion now you can knock out my

247
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,679
chronic and two studies function and

248
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:49,689
then you ask me you know what about

249
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,578
other advices people have have been you

250
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:54,010
know cannibal use that a lot what about

251
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:55,929
the plan I worked on I'm just no even

252
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:57,458
paper published about genome editing how

253
00:08:55,929 --> 00:09:00,068
can I do that well don't worry because

254
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:02,500
we have the tool have a lot of cash line

255
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:04,990
we have like six seven cast nine

256
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,309
what my customer you could test and then

257
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,549
for example this is group my

258
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:12,250
collaborating : either Rafa so he used

259
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,719
our system basically a billion

260
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,820
scientists come to my lab at the old

261
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,740
assembly and also other things learn and

262
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,300
we make all the vectors and for example

263
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,639
here just showing you three well this

264
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:24,039
Arab have scrutinized may is good ohmic

265
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,679
mice and a pant couldn't cast nine and

266
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:30,099
then you apply two carats and knock out

267
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:33,339
again the gene f3h gene is involving you

268
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,649
know this as a sounding accumulation in

269
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,780
carrot so if you look we start with the

270
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:40,120
high accumulation lying if you look at

271
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,769
this gene out they become white okay so

272
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,810
this actually this quantitative looking

273
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:45,429
at color cannot tell you how efficient

274
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:47,679
different cast on you assemble because

275
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:49,419
literally you do much work only on the

276
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,919
last step of gateway crooning you're

277
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:52,629
just using different cast nine you make

278
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:54,849
it just already had a much work at all I

279
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:56,950
mean in the ending but now even test a

280
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,779
lot of reagent then he concluded this

281
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,540
cast knowing optimize and applause has

282
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:03,429
worked very well carrots this is how you

283
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:05,409
can do and another example is a

284
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:08,769
collaborator Cameron group I was State

285
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:11,949
University and so we again here just

286
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:15,610
design just you know to guide RNA to

287
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:18,370
target to sites in the year to GE maze

288
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,710
and so should test that two different

289
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,560
construct and then we found that

290
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,930
efficiency is very high in just guide on

291
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:27,789
a mediating one hundred percent every

292
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:29,199
single plant is knockout and many of

293
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:30,610
them if you look carefully or by an

294
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,470
enigma codes okay

295
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,990
and then another guide RNA is ninety

296
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,570
ninety percent no code also very high so

297
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,340
he basically after she saw the result

298
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,410
she told me that if you know you know we

299
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,389
published people in crack Jonah last

300
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:45,969
year reporting a cast nine system you

301
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:48,639
know for for maze researchers but your

302
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,990
system seems better so she said well you

303
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,819
know so that's actually good because the

304
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,889
tool allow you to optimize the system

305
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,379
but we never really stopped you know

306
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:59,019
making better system so when this casts

307
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:01,779
nice a crisper cpf from our system has

308
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:04,389
been reported at 2015 I become very

309
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:05,679
interested for a lot of reasons and just

310
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:08,590
highlight a few of here focus for

311
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,599
example this CPF on protein is unlike

312
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,700
has nine kustanai making brunt and

313
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,649
cleavage three base pair away from the

314
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,600
ngg Pam sequels you all know that maybe

315
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:18,250
and then but sepia phones differ

316
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,930
just like zinc finger nucleases talent

317
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,870
that I have been working on it's

318
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:25,089
actually making a staggered end with a 5

319
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,440
gram and over hand if it's ripe if we're

320
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,470
making three primer behind which is

321
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,790
better for Jeff or HDR pathway Bastyr

322
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,250
you know the stick end there may be

323
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:35,949
really useful for example maybe you we

324
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,049
can use nhej a pass weight really sort

325
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,910
of inserting a donor DNA sequence so

326
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:42,429
making precise gene replacement and

327
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:44,049
Lewis well things like that and this has

328
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:46,299
to be has to be done you know in class

329
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:49,809
not many people yet published but also

330
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:51,370
CP CP f1 unlike Cassadine system it

331
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:54,489
actually only utilized a crispr RNA

332
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:56,470
which is like 43 nucleotide along for

333
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,700
CRISPR cast 9 we typically using single

334
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,590
guide on it which is fusing of Chris

335
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,129
Pawnee and the tree Solana together

336
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,750
right

337
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:05,679
it's a much longer like 100 base pair

338
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:08,500
100 this is much shorter and also CPF

339
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:11,620
one recognize the polity which is tea

340
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:15,100
tea tea tea Pam and which is a nicely

341
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,980
complement to the mgg pan of seek cast 9

342
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,649
so CPF one base we can recognize more 18

343
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,810
which genome or a bit recites and also

344
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:25,209
it cut away from the Pam

345
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,769
which means if small mutation induced

346
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,900
there maybe the guy Ronnie can still

347
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:31,240
recognize site and cut again which can

348
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:33,639
stimulate the further you know if we

349
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,980
pursue HDR maybe can stimulate the many

350
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,379
runs of cunning so this is really a very

351
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,259
unique so that become very interested as

352
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:43,389
so again my poster without being really

353
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:44,919
developing CPF one the first thing we

354
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:46,569
tested we just apply the same thing how

355
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:49,329
we express forecast lying with the same

356
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:51,670
thing with caste CPF won and we in

357
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,700
particularly we express gate on a with

358
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:56,169
you three u6 promoter not enough working

359
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,000
well we just don't know why we spend

360
00:12:56,169 --> 00:13:00,309
time troubleshooting and in the end that

361
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,919
we compared many systems and the system

362
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:04,869
come out very nicely so the system we

363
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,539
eventually worked out very well is

364
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,460
though I call that do report to promoter

365
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:11,289
system because we are using the same

366
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,269
promoter of poor to promoter you'll be

367
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:15,519
cooking promoter for maze and to drive

368
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:18,370
the CPF on protein and what we test it

369
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,740
is a s and ARB because these two protein

370
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,299
just happen to be the one show activity

371
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,370
in human cells we just follow those

372
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:26,979
things and then we also use same

373
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,320
promoter to drive the guy as a crisp RNA

374
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,860
or here's a problem because for pasta

375
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,320
promoters

376
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:35,320
unlike hopefully promoter like you three

377
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,060
start with a new six Thomas G it's very

378
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,089
hard to define the first nucleotide of

379
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:42,009
transcription and also we already based

380
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:43,990
on our failure I will see Pierre from

381
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:47,620
earlier we have kind of well already I

382
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:50,620
think that this crisp money has to be

383
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,500
precisely processed in order to retain

384
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,240
very high activity to do that we use the

385
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,578
two ribozyme which is hammerhead

386
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,079
ribozyme HD visor and for students here

387
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:01,419
representing you know it's self cleavage

388
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:03,969
on a right so just like enzyme so now

389
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:05,708
with that so you can imagine this

390
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,778
transfer will be processed by self

391
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:10,389
cleavage after making RNA and then this

392
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:11,799
precisely processed at they find the

393
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:14,139
lens of guide on and we now we're

394
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,389
compressed with you know CPF own protein

395
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:18,039
and then act to recognize DNA

396
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:20,110
genomically and making double strand

397
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:22,110
break and indeed this is case really

398
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,419
working nicely and here I just show you

399
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:29,050
six sites here and where you can see

400
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:31,240
every worked very nicely but a s half of

401
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:34,149
them working half even working so seem

402
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,250
to be some but ARB is robustly working

403
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:39,100
and then we look at what kind of

404
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:42,220
deletion mutation make and overall those

405
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,560
a s and ere be making over 95% are

406
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,778
making deletions instead of insertions

407
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,518
okay they're mostly elysion and in fact

408
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:52,448
deletion are actually sized are larger

409
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:54,190
sizes about marriages ranged from six to

410
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:56,049
certain based population which is

411
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,180
interesting because forecast nine we

412
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:59,319
typically in rice this is typically find

413
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:01,448
they're like one two three base part

414
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,100
addition ok this deletion from CPF form

415
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:04,990
is much larger and which can be

416
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,730
explained by a staggered end that's more

417
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:11,709
and processing after double shrimp break

418
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:13,420
so so what's really exciting for us is

419
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,458
really you know we have to show whether

420
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:17,588
we can make editor the paths right so

421
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:19,899
you make it we making a grow mediator

422
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:22,600
transformation of making cheesy low-rise

423
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:26,049
pants and excitingly for the plant we

424
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,329
have surveyed and 100% not cut every

425
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:31,328
single plant is not hot and what's rare

426
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:33,429
astonishing is really that almost every

427
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:35,049
single plant is by an enigma code which

428
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:36,129
which means already none aloo okay

429
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:37,659
because those copy of chromosome

430
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:40,159
question has been knocked out because

431
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:43,309
rice is deployed

432
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:45,919
and so this is really exciting so and

433
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:48,319
then you know this is air BCP f1 and

434
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,669
then of course then you know other

435
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,560
research including Cameron are

436
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:53,779
interested in so we collaboratively we

437
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,639
show it's also working knockout gene in

438
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:57,980
mace so you can imagine you have now

439
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,799
another tool Christmas EP f1 for genome

440
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:04,670
editing and but you know the thing is

441
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:07,370
the CPF one not only to prefer eighty

442
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:10,849
which region but the pam that the one

443
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:13,490
working with a s and ARB nucleus in

444
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,500
human cells are really prefering TTT Pam

445
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,940
you know you know if you're such a

446
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,919
genome or gene of interest it rather

447
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,550
hard to find the triple-t right so you

448
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:26,360
know it's really limiting you and so

449
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:28,399
then when I have a new post or join the

450
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,190
lab ensure so she's actually asked

451
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,889
question can we really making the CPF

452
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,540
one system more accessible we can find

453
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:37,009
more tal sites in the genome in the Jing

454
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:38,539
of interest then it will be become more

455
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:40,759
use right that's kind of obvious

456
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:42,349
question but then if you look at many of

457
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,569
this indeed it there's actually quite a

458
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:48,019
few CPF on protein so the broken has

459
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,940
only TT d Pam instead of TTT V the V

460
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:54,590
just Stan in any nucleotide and opti

461
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:56,420
like a CG okay T TV so but the only fnc

462
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:59,600
p phone has been shown some activity

463
00:16:56,419 --> 00:17:01,789
hume implants and we look at literature

464
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,699
that's only one single site which is

465
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:07,459
actually edited by f and c PF Onias t TV

466
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:09,920
so all the site is actually GT TV so

467
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,049
although other research acclaim fnc p1

468
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,300
recognized you know t TV there's no data

469
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:16,578
backing that so then we want to

470
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:20,078
systematically look in this problem so

471
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:23,119
so first we look at as we just look at

472
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,188
many sites ten sites here which are t TV

473
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,078
p.m. and then we design another

474
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:29,690
different difference of guide RNA which

475
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:32,269
are utilizing TT TV Pam so for F and C

476
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,130
if your phone clearly as you can see you

477
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:37,220
know the TT TV Pam the sites are really

478
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,710
more show more activity you know editing

479
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,049
activity so it's compare the T TV but

480
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,670
the inner some T TV works some not

481
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:45,079
really working which kind of puzzling

482
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,690
but on the other hand it's kind of

483
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:50,299
suggesting that maybe hidden lore which

484
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,009
are dictating the activity of CPF form

485
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:53,629
recognizing T TV p.m. this is kind of

486
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:56,180
make us to chase

487
00:17:53,630 --> 00:18:00,110
you know make robustly working at ttv

488
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:02,539
site but before that we look at how CPR

489
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:04,819
from editing at a titty titty TV and TV

490
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:07,339
side compare so this is the two ttv

491
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:09,679
sites and this is TT TV sites overall

492
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:10,879
they making very similar profile is the

493
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,830
deletion this is kind of where the

494
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,930
condition occur and this edition size

495
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:16,639
and if you look deeper most of deletion

496
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:20,600
actually are kind of repaired by micro

497
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,340
homology of DNA so then we also look at

498
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,559
the specificity because one big problem

499
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:26,000
is a specific would that be any of

500
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,649
tightening problem any of us you know

501
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,500
you know using CRISPR cash we asked this

502
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,970
question so one thing - one way to look

503
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,859
at instead of looking at hormonal

504
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,450
homeowner sequence in the genome is just

505
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:38,389
you can we can make mismatch and guide

506
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:40,759
RNA and to targeted the the same time

507
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,230
effect and then we just make these every

508
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,089
two mutating every two nucleotide of

509
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,710
making mismatch occur on a as you can

510
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:48,470
tell most of the guy tonic or burst

511
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:51,380
function completely only at the very end

512
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,029
like the nucleotide at 2122 nucleotide

513
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,250
and you actually see very similar

514
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:58,779
activity which kind of suggests you know

515
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:01,819
when we design crispr RNA for CPF one

516
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:03,619
especially for f1 CPF one maybe we don't

517
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:06,649
have to design like 23 nucleotide alone

518
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:09,079
okay because 22 seems 21 seem to twenty

519
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,310
actually maybe already working but

520
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:12,139
overall I think it's they're very

521
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:15,200
specific they could earlier mismatch or

522
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,090
abhorrest function this is at t TV said

523
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,720
this is actually TVs at same similar

524
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:24,169
conclusion so but then we haven't really

525
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,440
answer why f1 GP f1 worked at some T TV

526
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:31,370
side some are not so it's kind of steer

527
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,350
puzzling so to do that we are look at we

528
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:35,659
basically you need this approach we

529
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:37,339
search rice genome to find the exact

530
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,840
same proto space the proto space are

531
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:40,759
basically just target sequence of 23

532
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,889
nucleotide we just looking at rice

533
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:44,119
genome to find exact same site okay to

534
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,520
perk eater here and they are different

535
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:48,529
chromosome same sequence and also both

536
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:52,430
also have the CRISPR Pam

537
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:53,779
except one is T V T TV the reason is we

538
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,000
are hypothesizing at adjacent the

539
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:58,279
nucleotide may also play a role of

540
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,049
impact in the function of CPF one that's

541
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:03,019
why we call it in bttv because only

542
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:05,240
difference is one is having extra t1 is

543
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:07,190
lacking extra 1t

544
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,210
otherwise the whole sequence is same but

545
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,590
they are just located in different

546
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,798
chromosome different sites in the genome

547
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:14,329
so then we let same a guide on a guided

548
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,788
to recognize both sides look at

549
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:17,928
efficiency so we look at that I don't

550
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:19,490
have to show you data because actually

551
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:22,220
published us last month's paper I just

552
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,769
don't have to go through but overall we

553
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,929
found it s in factor f and c PF

554
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:30,048
unrecognized most of VT TV although

555
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:32,659
about different activity here but they

556
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:35,028
mostly fail to act on GT ta and a city

557
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:37,039
pc sites so if you want to design if you

558
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:38,630
want how in f1 with there you know you

559
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,509
try to avoid these two sites that's kind

560
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:43,460
of a conclusion but how can you find

561
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:45,648
another way to make sure you can tackle

562
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,230
more sites in the genome besides just

563
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:49,879
truncated you know TT TV to t TV so

564
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,759
actually a fun dance group and last year

565
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:57,409
I have shown the engineer that some

566
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:59,269
variant of ASC pf1 as well as ABC and to

567
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:01,309
recognize the for example making the are

568
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:03,168
variants just different amino acid a

569
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:06,769
change in the protein now the protein

570
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:09,020
can recognize cccc or T ycv Pam just

571
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:10,908
changed so we kind of want to apply the

572
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,769
same variant test in our system or

573
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:13,940
they're gonna work and here's a result

574
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:16,009
and over oi

575
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,080
yes it's working we actually also

576
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:20,419
introduced a mutation based on protein

577
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,879
structure to effing but we enjoy the

578
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:25,610
less success but overall the red one

579
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,590
showing is air be our variant over all

580
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:29,778
work very well recognizing the cccc

581
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:32,928
three sites or working but then many

582
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:35,119
many sites of T ycv and then different

583
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:37,820
varying a quite decent activity input

584
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:40,069
process but but the FN variant and not

585
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:41,898
really you know that active but nobody

586
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:45,619
has ever published anyway we figured

587
00:21:41,898 --> 00:21:47,509
maybe that's other Runet and then in

588
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:50,750
that study that also should RvR variants

589
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:53,269
and then you know which recognized the t

590
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:56,569
ITB and as they claimed also recognized

591
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:58,490
ta well yeah TI TC and th EG we tested

592
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:00,889
both but we didn't really find it

593
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:03,319
working in th TC probably found it

594
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:06,649
shoulda you know three a two out of

595
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:09,950
three sites and both FN and air be this

596
00:22:06,648 --> 00:22:11,500
avi are variant can recognize th e g so

597
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:14,389
this is kind of the data from rice again

598
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,159
but but you what I wonder ask you know

599
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:17,599
what about making can you make edits you

600
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,720
know stable a transgenic mass or you

601
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,819
know even without Shastri

602
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,919
we of course did it just this is summary

603
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:24,358
but I just want to don't have time to

604
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,769
run through but over I just want to give

605
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:27,778
you the information is like you know

606
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:30,089
whatever we see something working in the

607
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:32,278
proto past somatic sir and then we can

608
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:33,959
almost deduce what is gonna work in a

609
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:35,339
stable shattering past or not I even

610
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,409
have base our system is very reliable

611
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:39,298
very much correlated for sings not

612
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:41,159
working you know it's gonna be zero

613
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:43,679
percent but you know I just want to

614
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:48,059
pilot here for example this ABC the are

615
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,798
variants recognized GTCC you know we we

616
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:51,028
got almost nearly 100 percent knock out

617
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:54,148
it's very efficient if you know

618
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:56,608
targeting those sites but overall after

619
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:59,699
this work and originally we start with

620
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:02,489
the air be an F and CPF one we know they

621
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,840
reliable and recognized tttd which is

622
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:06,538
like it just many sizing the rice genome

623
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,999
and now with you know FN c PF one we

624
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:10,950
defined where which kind of work VTT

625
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:13,019
deep ham they can target and now we

626
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,090
quickly expanded it to success many

627
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:17,548
sites and now we further engineered

628
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:19,499
those air be the are variant you have

629
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:21,569
this many of blue sites and then you

630
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:24,479
have the you know air B's avi are

631
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:26,158
variants recognize th eg the overall we

632
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:28,979
kind of concluded with our newer agents

633
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,379
you Co job for the sites you can target

634
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:32,519
it compact originally you have and we

635
00:23:31,378 --> 00:23:35,848
did a similar and asking our abductors

636
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,589
more or less the same now I want to

637
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:39,689
shift gear to Australia because you know

638
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:42,269
many of you are really interesting of

639
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:44,489
targeting especially not only for this

640
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:46,409
plant research but also for biomedical

641
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:48,960
research like human gene therapy right

642
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:50,129
application of Christmas so but one

643
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,690
thing I want to brought to you in here

644
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:54,228
for the nature same journal nature pant

645
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:57,269
actually published controversial papers

646
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:59,759
2015 is published correspondence saying

647
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,919
you know it's very safe because well so

648
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,899
not virus if not much of targeting found

649
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,019
by whole genome sequencing and it could

650
00:24:03,898 --> 00:24:08,939
have mice mouse and then last year

651
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:11,239
published another paper you know like

652
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,979
okay no we found a lot of kind of

653
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:16,139
collateral damage due to maybe Cassadine

654
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:18,450
protein seems a lot of targeting lot of

655
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:20,668
OS and these it's covered in the genome

656
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:23,879
of editor Mouse the beauty of the system

657
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:26,340
is the only sequence to one animal which

658
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:27,748
is being genome editor I I think the

659
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,939
statistic as the sample size too

660
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:31,319
smoothly or agree right so although they

661
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,650
included a few parents are you know

662
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,700
control but even

663
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,710
or this thought it kind of control

664
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,630
become the control animal become a

665
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,420
questionable so that's why you know if

666
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:42,820
you are meeting the news last week it

667
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:45,910
retracted which is no surprise you know

668
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:47,799
and nature nature mr. pubb's editorial

669
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,710
actually specifically addressing

670
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:53,470
retraction of this paper and they also

671
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,220
publish like five a challenge paper to

672
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:59,019
show why just paper has to be retracted

673
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,730
analysis how Express being design I'm

674
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:02,920
not very good so this paper being

675
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,269
retracted and and what's it really

676
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,370
interesting for me is when you read the

677
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:09,220
editorial that the editor concluded are

678
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:11,319
you know still to this day that's your

679
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,750
very little work a prior genome

680
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:15,700
sequencing to look at whatever animal

681
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,980
organ it has been genome modified to

682
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,170
look at whether cast nine or CPS on have

683
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,610
Clara damaged in a unit not much work

684
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,590
has been done it's kind of like they

685
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:28,179
conclude that so well that's actually

686
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:30,189
that's true or have to but in fact you

687
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,870
know we actually was Clarita we about

688
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,220
three years ago we already sort of

689
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:36,309
thinking about this problem potentially

690
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,390
you know and about less than three years

691
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:39,369
but almost three years ago we started

692
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,660
thinking how can we answer especially

693
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:43,209
because this question has to be answered

694
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,590
in a good way then we can progress sort

695
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,269
of data to the research community or

696
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:49,679
even to regulator like FDA or US

697
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:52,210
agencies so what we did is actually we

698
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,370
we design a bunch of like twelve guide

699
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,410
RNA forecasts nine and we collect them

700
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:58,389
we test those casts nine protein for

701
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,940
different activity in rice ranked hill

702
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:03,280
from very relatively low that 25% of

703
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,019
activity based on how many cheese

704
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,119
illa-llah you scored how many are being

705
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:10,000
edited we score that efficiency okay if

706
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,519
you have ten a 100 a 925 being edited at

707
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,019
25 percent but we also have cast nine in

708
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:15,609
some Thai sites one a person every

709
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:17,950
single lines being modified edited and

710
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:19,240
then we have CPF own protein which being

711
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,330
modified that one represents because our

712
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,289
system very efficient so and then total

713
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:26,349
we have twelve

714
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:29,230
guide on a forecast nine and three guide

715
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:30,519
on e4 c PF one so then what we do is we

716
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,069
making comes will be making a lot of

717
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:35,619
transgenic modify the plant which is a

718
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:37,569
rope ramp and then we based on the edits

719
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:40,719
we choose editor plant we followed them

720
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:42,399
a to TL C 0 because some edit plants

721
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,480
still contain the transgene still

722
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,280
expressing the nucleus

723
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,390
whether constitutively expressed nucleus

724
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,819
were little

725
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,140
another question mother but the forest

726
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:52,299
experience most important seeing is not

727
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,130
like getting these lines it's really

728
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:56,710
about getting the contours right this is

729
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,480
the mouth study contact so for us we

730
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,940
really include a lot of control for

731
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,319
example we know slowly just having see

732
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,970
the from cedar you know from one

733
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,829
generation to generation by nature you

734
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,680
have mutation so that's why we actually

735
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:11,470
prepares regeneration of rice seeds from

736
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:14,140
2015 to a 16 to 17 so regeneration of

737
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,180
rice seeds from Sita - Sita and we also

738
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,650
look at tissue culture because the way

739
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,330
we the genome editing is tissue cultures

740
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:22,120
are about your transformation in this

741
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:24,369
case and then we have craft which is

742
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:26,319
have a grow bacteria infection no a grow

743
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:28,059
and we also have you know planting

744
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,669
infected with a block contained cast 9

745
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:33,159
gene without together on a and also

746
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:36,100
contain CPF own gene which I'll get on

747
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,960
it and cast 1900 kind of control and we

748
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:39,789
sequence independent a two-line each for

749
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,039
these control and these four lines for

750
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:43,799
these control 12 line here so then many

751
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:46,899
many lines here to de we sequence about

752
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:49,089
17 lines total and you know just give

753
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,560
you some idea this is actually the

754
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:52,179
another self control plan they don't

755
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,279
have to pay much attention the point is

756
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,019
we we try to use all different three

757
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:58,210
different software looking at to court

758
00:27:56,019 --> 00:28:01,720
in there's insertion deletion as well

759
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:03,549
snips and just to be sure so so this is

760
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,430
just look at only your overlap to

761
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:07,779
further tool for further analysis and we

762
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,370
have we did it for you this is just

763
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:12,309
welcome show but we did for all the

764
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:13,779
lines and here's some data so the data

765
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:16,029
first of all we are interesting whether

766
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:17,769
we have mutation from city to city of

767
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:19,990
course you know if you cry seeds from

768
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:23,440
seeding rice in our case we found about

769
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:28,150
20 mutation you know over India s only

770
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:30,039
snips SMB and also about 20 insertion

771
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,050
deletion half half basically marriage

772
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:33,730
for a mutation just hot from cedar to

773
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:34,990
seed which is happen randomly if you

774
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,940
want to look at where they located or

775
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:38,259
just random in the genome and then we

776
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,299
know character with a tissue culture in

777
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:43,420
tissue culture in fact introduced about

778
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:46,480
here is a 100-ton e s and these snips

779
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,430
and about here is like a little bit

780
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,110
lower than 100 like India's it's a

781
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,880
barrier because we have tissue culture

782
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:54,429
only almost every bacterial infection

783
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,650
only and a backbone only as it seems

784
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,900
Avila bacteria resulting little bit more

785
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,160
in insertion deletions but we don't want

786
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,509
to claim that we want to be careful

787
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,550
but we still sing awesome one size may

788
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:06,009
be still limited but overall you can

789
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:08,859
tell on average you know the doesn't

790
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:11,170
really seem to be you know on average we

791
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:12,669
show you a lot of mutation just English

792
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:15,009
control panel you have to treat this

793
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,570
country a mutation as background in any

794
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:18,640
plant being modified by genome you can

795
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:20,980
express this it's never message about -

796
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,790
hungry mutation in the plant you editing

797
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,470
rice okay

798
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:25,899
and the question is what about all

799
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,490
really editor pants so this is stacking

800
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,340
the editor crammed together this very is

801
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:32,259
just cast nine the the green is CPF Wong

802
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:33,939
you compared to those backbone only as

803
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:37,420
you can see a ver äj--

804
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:39,130
here so this is SMB this is in there on

805
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:42,400
average they're more a similar ok it's a

806
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:44,530
similar level and so if you look at

807
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,390
whether you have one inky Dean search in

808
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:47,920
two or three because we haven't have

809
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,480
some line even have three TD insertion

810
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,550
but I have overall eighty percent of

811
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,870
charge in fact only have one single TD

812
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:54,460
insertion so that's the beauty of all

813
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:56,229
about your transformation system very

814
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,120
limited a number of copy number of T DNA

815
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,009
but nevertheless we can finally you know

816
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:01,449
T DNA you know not copy numbers nothing

817
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:04,059
really contributing how many mutation

818
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,380
you have okay and then we also we happen

819
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:06,879
to have a few construct which

820
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,160
simultaneous express more than one guide

821
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,020
RNA we do perks that we'll talk the two

822
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,730
sites in the genome and we also found

823
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,180
that those even expressing duper guide

824
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,529
RNA

825
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,029
doesn't really seem to be you know

826
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:18,039
having more mutation compact a single

827
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:19,720
guy tonic and so really there's no

828
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:23,349
correlation we did a more correlational

829
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,450
but I want to skip those things and so

830
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:27,369
but but the conclusion is very clear

831
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:30,160
then we look at now we are limiting to

832
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:32,529
about 200 mutation every single plant we

833
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,509
have right now it's very easy you know

834
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:35,710
we almost know this mutation mostly due

835
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:37,990
to tissue culture because we already

836
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:40,630
found in the control austere we can look

837
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,339
at individually each each mutation

838
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,800
whether really they are off targeting

839
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:47,230
you to cast an eye or sepia or not and I

840
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,269
have to tell you only one site from cast

841
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,950
nine we find evidence we found a

842
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:53,369
mutation you need a tingle of perfect

843
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:56,410
this is because we purposely designed

844
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:58,359
130 guide RNA because we designed that

845
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:00,100
way and because we figured out if we

846
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:02,500
don't find anything it's rather

847
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:04,539
disappointing right so we designed a

848
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,009
guide RNA which has kind of off taliking

849
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:08,349
potential like PCR primer not really

850
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:09,970
perfectly doesn't a few other sites in

851
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:12,429
the genome will be in the only one or

852
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,980
two mismatch we know that and indeed

853
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,960
suicides infinitely

854
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,910
those guys can be luckily predicted by

855
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,410
any computer software right you can

856
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,029
produce that but for you it's good

857
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,250
because now if you can avoid the also

858
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:25,470
conclusion we have used if you can make

859
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,179
your guide RNA your second occluded

860
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,519
skate on it compared to your own target

861
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:31,860
again RNA if the if the off starting

862
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,929
Kidani contain at least two mismatched

863
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:35,759
compared to your guide RNA you are very

864
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:37,110
safe it's very unlikely to be edited

865
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,329
this is base RT the whole genome

866
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:41,129
sequence data and then we find another

867
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:42,808
new mutation another line have mutation

868
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,730
but easily we figured out just from

869
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:46,918
parent align because there's no no

870
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,839
evidence of any you know similarity to

871
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,610
the guide RNA and all the mutation we

872
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:52,048
discovered is like s and we rather than

873
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:54,209
searching conditions for the inserting

874
00:31:52,048 --> 00:31:56,160
deletion is the trademark of Cassadine

875
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,019
or CPF own technology mostly insertion

876
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,269
creation rather than s and these but

877
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:01,889
these are mostly snv's we know it's most

878
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:03,569
like a pogrom mutation and we just

879
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,650
happen to be overlooked from parent and

880
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:06,149
lying even though we see with so many

881
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,798
parents austere you know that's

882
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,750
variation among parents you miss you

883
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:12,779
overlook some mutations but this is only

884
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:15,390
one side over all although 15 guide

885
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:17,548
honest we only find a 130 guide on

886
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,929
resulting of poverty it's I think the

887
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:21,660
conclusion is very clear like we think

888
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:24,720
it's very safe I don't say say but off

889
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,169
timing is very you know negligible

890
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,720
almost

891
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:29,730
so we then look at the t-one plants we

892
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,950
don't really find any just having cast

893
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:34,470
nine constitutive expressing in the pan

894
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,298
if the cation is specific we loan really

895
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:38,519
have evidence of any accumulated

896
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:39,298
mutation so it's even safe to express

897
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,589
them in the plant

898
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:46,168
constitutively so here now i've already

899
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:47,789
covered a CRISPR cas9 system my lab

900
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:50,309
developed and applies I mean different

901
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:52,710
plant species at high efficiency level I

902
00:32:50,308 --> 00:32:54,509
also introduced you a crisper CPF form

903
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:57,150
and more importantly I share the most

904
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:59,220
recent data about of targeting and so

905
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:01,259
far good so it's very premised it's

906
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,150
really promising as really a promise in

907
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:04,950
my title really we can use an opening

908
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,960
rice tomato many many other plants if

909
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,850
you imagine you know luckily you know

910
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,289
you know recently the US do you have

911
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:12,119
regulation they say we are not we are

912
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:13,379
not gonna regulate these genome but in

913
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,418
France likes more insertion deletion

914
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,980
anything you can achieve by commercial

915
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:18,840
breeding so USD also make the

916
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,720
announcement recently all data are

917
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:23,069
really packing announcement but I at the

918
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,850
beginning I also introduced you know

919
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:26,319
this this hot

920
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:29,139
to make this is another challenge right

921
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:31,569
so how can you achieve HDR you know hire

922
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,880
highly efficiently and of course you

923
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:35,619
know I continue to do work many is good

924
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,960
I started because I want to achieve this

925
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:39,339
high efficiency but everybody you know

926
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,039
in the audience may also agree Arab love

927
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:44,079
Sally Jana is really a racist for study

928
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:46,359
but I have to conclude it may not be a

929
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,609
great system for Ginny emeriti but but

930
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,869
the wheel it in hard way and I'm gonna

931
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,339
share I don't have time to share you

932
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:53,799
with data but this is what we did it

933
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:57,730
will very try different reagent in arab

934
00:33:53,799 --> 00:34:01,059
doses to really try to stimulating the

935
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:02,620
genome editing in out of doses so this

936
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:03,819
is work actually traveling with my

937
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:06,279
former mentor time for it was at

938
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:08,679
minnesota so so what we get are

939
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:11,559
basically we try the zinc finger nucleus

940
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:15,460
here on crispiness and we express these

941
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:17,860
reagents at inducible promoter and also

942
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,750
consider promoter and even mayo to the

943
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,700
promoter and we try to talk him because

944
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,650
gene certian by extra we tried knocking

945
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:26,049
a Jing with BA

946
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:27,400
Gus and GFP different marker gene a

947
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:30,700
different drink different loci in the

948
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,470
genome and so what we really and we even

949
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:36,159
using viral replicas replicated donor

950
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:38,379
DNA and we try the many many things but

951
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,029
we can but in the end what we found is

952
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,670
we find many lines some lines have very

953
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:44,830
high evidence of HDR in somatic so if

954
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:47,680
you take Harris positive if you evaluate

955
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:50,230
gene editing by HDR yes it's present

956
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,269
sometimes something I have 50% has based

957
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,460
on the viral replicant system but then

958
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:56,409
we have a seeds from the plant to score

959
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:59,470
them whether they have event German are

960
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:00,940
transmitted I'm sorry so it's rather

961
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:03,579
disappointing we only have very little

962
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,710
success so what what's really so that's

963
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:08,799
why we found a big disconnect between

964
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:10,389
somatic and germline HDR events you know

965
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,519
disappointing it's many years work we

966
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:13,960
further you know hope only for the money

967
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,489
we spend on that or full of people for

968
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,539
the work but also for the community a

969
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:19,119
lot of people take things for granted

970
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:20,889
it's easy to do in arab doses we sing we

971
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,259
better reporters even a lot of negative

972
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:24,730
data so only way we feel it may be to

973
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,920
report get it published maybe by the

974
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:28,990
letter to editor you know just because

975
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,480
you have a fully asleep supplement data

976
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:33,250
or negative you know maybe that's one

977
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,539
way to go but anyway we write a letter

978
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,480
we think maybe that's where you know

979
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:38,739
report i think i see i have some

980
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,199
hypotheses but i don't have

981
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:43,719
time to discuss I think that's about

982
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:45,759
dinner repair about how what cancer

983
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:48,579
you're editing but luckily what we

984
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,410
concluded here is that may be the better

985
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:52,900
way right now is achieving cheating in

986
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:54,519
America HDR is really to editor the

987
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,889
pants like from somatic cell like

988
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,360
catalyze Cal I and then regenerate

989
00:35:56,889 --> 00:36:00,519
depants out of that rather than harvest

990
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,410
seeds from like Anna blossoms a little

991
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:04,179
different because you throw at it so

992
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:05,829
luckily all the plant we are working

993
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:07,690
actually mostly goes through tissue

994
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:09,159
culture I think that wouldn't facing

995
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:12,970
this problem that's kind of good aside

996
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:14,829
Bastyr I believe or the plant when we

997
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:16,509
you know a pride genome editing more or

998
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:18,489
less we have to overcome their own

999
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:21,190
problem you know relative a species

1000
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:23,799
which has to be worked out individually

1001
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:25,240
and nevertheless I hope you can convince

1002
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,010
them we are at the end of the beginning

1003
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:28,750
of genome editing because we're at the

1004
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,310
end because we have for most of you you

1005
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,039
have enough to knock out a gene of

1006
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:34,420
interest if you only want to knock out

1007
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:36,039
but you know we are at the beginning of

1008
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,980
applying them to many many plants which

1009
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:40,300
are kind of exciting I think but another

1010
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,610
thing is about how can you make better

1011
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,920
crop a product right so so I think

1012
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:47,320
another limitation is that can you get a

1013
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,030
you know access to the elite cut you

1014
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,950
need to nine like among Santo other

1015
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:53,350
Apple a big company they have right now

1016
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:55,000
then if you have that maybe literary

1017
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:57,699
academic laboratory can do genome

1018
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,019
editing you know you know people can

1019
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:00,339
grow them you know especially now it's

1020
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:02,139
not regulated maybe you could say that

1021
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,670
means how much market who knows I mean

1022
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:04,750
that's a lot of potential right that's

1023
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,880
why I say you know what he make a lot of

1024
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,440
people very excited but whether you can

1025
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,269
you know do that in jump as much as

1026
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:15,369
quickly to collaboration so if I end so

1027
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:17,559
so one work we I did with a collaborator

1028
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:19,510
tapping sounds broke he has to LeBlanc

1029
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:21,489
is in China was in Australia so with

1030
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,440
them I'm being signaling in his lab what

1031
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,750
we did is we are not coaching he has

1032
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,490
been worked on many years CSA G and this

1033
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:29,710
Ching if you knock out this gene we is

1034
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:32,319
Chris podcast now in this case and it

1035
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:34,659
actually the trait is actually in them a

1036
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,760
sensitivity so the mutant work them in

1037
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:40,179
this case if you grew that in the show

1038
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,250
day the the pollen basically is either

1039
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:43,719
unfertile in fact in photo not

1040
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,730
pollinating but if you're growing a

1041
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:47,319
short in in a long day and then it

1042
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,269
partly become photo now you can

1043
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,220
basically switch the Commission and

1044
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:52,269
making a pollen for tell what's a big

1045
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:54,609
deer but that actually

1046
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:56,849
knowledge behind a two-line hybridize

1047
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:58,720
system very nice because rice harvest is

1048
00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:00,549
conventionally rely on three lines you

1049
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,069
have to have a maintainer lying to give

1050
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,780
the one which are still up right that

1051
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:07,480
one can you know you know receiving

1052
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,170
other but now we actually can making the

1053
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,960
same line

1054
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,880
just switch condition becomes still out

1055
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,710
or in stellar so this is actually

1056
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,480
technology behind a two line so this is

1057
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,490
one way we can apply this we can the

1058
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,460
point I want to make here we can

1059
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:23,109
calculate making them edit in the unit

1060
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,760
lines they didn't really can I just show

1061
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,980
you one here this is a Wi-Fi abuser you

1062
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,420
later nine farmer Road you stop my area

1063
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,309
of Sean - Graham you know it's really

1064
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,800
lying the jump lands people are using

1065
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:35,170
right so this is part of reading you to

1066
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,730
really apply Chris podcasts and more

1067
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:39,309
recently collaborator humans and we

1068
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,590
worked on similarly instead of one gene

1069
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:43,269
we can target L you know mark or cutie

1070
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,220
urging right because see the trait see

1071
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:47,259
the size here the can be determined by

1072
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:49,239
many many genes but now we can you know

1073
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,060
multiple using all cost retargeting many

1074
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:53,649
genes at once and true cat not only

1075
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:55,179
tired of many genes but also technology

1076
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:59,019
in elite lines

1077
00:38:55,179 --> 00:39:01,359
okay so theory just like 3 to 1 J is to

1078
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:02,860
elite 9 anyway so and then you can look

1079
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,500
at the industry any time you can get

1080
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:07,990
single three single mutant double mutant

1081
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,550
s and then triple mutant and IA variates

1082
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:11,259
the gene worker because we I mean we

1083
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,180
what we's out of doses or the motor

1084
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,790
parenting program we think the Jing of

1085
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:17,139
function can be translated easily no not

1086
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:18,550
the case even in their eyes even if you

1087
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:20,170
go out drinking rice in some other

1088
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,460
species if you're putting definitely

1089
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,260
later 9 may be different we have to

1090
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,590
evaluate that from gridding point of

1091
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,450
view

1092
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,710
indeed it we finally in a variation for

1093
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:29,589
different rated trait you know we

1094
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:31,539
evaluated even same gene ok so this is

1095
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:33,610
again highlight the importance not only

1096
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:35,769
working we interact but you must almost

1097
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:37,480
have to test them in uni trying to see

1098
00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:40,059
whether really the performance of treaty

1099
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,099
introduced really good or not ok with

1100
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:43,809
before I end I because like I said I

1101
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:45,819
don't have time to do it

1102
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:46,750
introduce any other tool because but you

1103
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,970
know we already published three papers

1104
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,369
about you know making activate or

1105
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:53,109
repress of regulated genes and this is

1106
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:54,940
three years ago and last year were

1107
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:57,579
published another paper on you know

1108
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,110
repressor but see peso CPS found a

1109
00:39:57,579 --> 00:40:02,259
strong repressor to repress gene of

1110
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:03,519
interest of transmission ever and a year

1111
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,900
later earlier this year we published

1112
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,699
another work we repurposed act

1113
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,680
you know to make a stronger activated in

1114
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:11,960
first paper active aging we even

1115
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,679
repurpose the Tarot system to make our

1116
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,420
typist

1117
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:16,279
gene activation if you are interested I

1118
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,809
encourage you read this I can make the

1119
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,350
resource available in fact all the

1120
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:23,269
passes are available at antigen that's

1121
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:24,980
why I cook knowledge that we try to make

1122
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:26,449
food available to all the researcher

1123
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,969
even before publication that's kind of

1124
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:32,419
what do we do and with that I would

1125
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:34,250
really want to thank first of all

1126
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,190
startup from two universities and the

1127
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:39,849
company and the NCBI technology it's in

1128
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:42,530
Janka support my previous research and I

1129
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:44,509
sometimes forget to mention all the

1130
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:46,940
collaborators in my slides I go too fast

1131
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:49,880
I really want to approach all of them so

1132
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:51,829
every single you know project is

1133
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,660
collaboration without them not possible

1134
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:56,809
and a lot of people in the lab data's

1135
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:58,299
hard work I will stop here so take any

1136
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:05,748
question if you have thank you

1137
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:05,749
[Applause]

1138
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:09,860
okay yeah I think to answer your

1139
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,710
question I think first of all I think

1140
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,720
either way will work if you even design

1141
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,789
single guy on a it worked in your plant

1142
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,679
of Jing of interest making edits but you

1143
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:20,509
know of course it's the most likely it

1144
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:22,730
is different in there or whatever

1145
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:25,130
station right have different events if

1146
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,079
they all abortion function basically you

1147
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,670
know what they got and then they give

1148
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:31,549
you same phenotype I think that's fair

1149
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,079
to say it's strong enough compared to

1150
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,370
even the two independent Anoka because

1151
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:36,920
if you sometimes if you knock out gene

1152
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:38,989
cation energy maybe not fully abortion

1153
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,639
functional but gene protein right so so

1154
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:51,949
it's very very that depending what kind

1155
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:53,539
of situation are talking about yeah yeah

1156
00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:55,849
along that's lying it's really hard to

1157
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:58,009
address because the more is better in

1158
00:42:55,849 --> 00:43:00,500
that case more independent is better and

1159
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:02,450
the but if off timing you know it's due

1160
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,610
to very much same commerce string you

1161
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:06,710
are being being edited because katana is

1162
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:09,260
falling same sequence maybe still you

1163
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:11,960
cannot really know yeah overall trying

1164
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,730
more is better and

1165
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,289
III don't really think this is debating

1166
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:17,539
anything from conventional genetic even

1167
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:18,559
EMS honestly because you know

1168
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:20,269
Commissioner you have to do

1169
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,338
complementary you know you have to make

1170
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:23,719
it white up gene back to the mutant to

1171
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:25,759
show it's rescue the phenotype I think

1172
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:28,419
if you can show that you do better even

1173
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,420
with Chris podcasts

1174
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:39,530
yes equipped at all with any of the

1175
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:41,509
adenosine images crisper Sanders yes I

1176
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:46,330
do but I don't have data here so yeah I

1177
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:49,820
welcome that yes yeah of course

1178
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:54,650
if published I mean I yeah so yeah yeah

1179
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:57,140
so this c2t basic editing and recently a

1180
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:58,460
2g based editing yeah that reminds me I

1181
00:43:57,139 --> 00:43:59,599
have a couple mask of review on a 2g

1182
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,769
there's a lot of eight with people

1183
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,170
following a 2g people David a little

1184
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:05,119
published a few months ago about a 2g

1185
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:07,460
based editing and but I have to say

1186
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,859
overall this base editing system are

1187
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,869
lower efficiency compatible if you wanna

1188
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:14,059
know how G a compared to it just just

1189
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:17,359
using Chris Picasso at have nucleus okay

1190
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:19,789
second of thing is a based editing seems

1191
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,670
to be over promising from izing sings

1192
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:24,800
because it claimed c-to-t or a 2g

1193
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:27,170
changed but in the end in that window of

1194
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,780
a few new trader NEC can be changed to T

1195
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:31,250
any a you really are being limited that

1196
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,680
you have to spring a lot of round design

1197
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:36,619
catering carefully you to me you know

1198
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:38,329
it's not great yet so they still have to

1199
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:40,159
you know wait work out window narrow

1200
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:41,840
down or proto mean is that different

1201
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:50,299
application but my lab is actually

1202
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:51,920
looking I think based I think we have

1203
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,960
based anything we have a lot of

1204
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,940
application for promoter bashing for

1205
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,429
sure that a lot of other things or or

1206
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,110
you want to spring a naturally evolving

1207
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:02,269
disease resistant gene I stimulating

1208
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:04,490
change you know across coding sequence

1209
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:06,349
of our gene you can imagine but to me is

1210
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:08,449
the system has to be made better I'm

1211
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:10,089
working at with you know so yeah it's

1212
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:32,210
not that efficiently yet it's working

1213
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:33,769
yeah yes Lee the question sorry the

1214
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,329
question here is usually you will need

1215
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:37,159
to transformation you get like 10 to 20

1216
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:38,599
percent transmission efficiency how can

1217
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:40,219
you get to even like 100 percent the

1218
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:42,589
editing efficiency okay here's a

1219
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:44,480
misconception basically what we look

1220
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:45,980
tears we first look at the plants which

1221
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,590
are transgenic in this case sort of

1222
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:50,630
select already and among all the plants

1223
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:53,960
are edited as then we can say 100 edits

1224
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:56,450
yeah if the wrong even don't hire a

1225
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,309
transgene we don't count because not

1226
00:45:56,449 --> 00:46:15,369
raspbian not to even have a reagent so

1227
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:18,949
yeah yes that's ok there's a casting

1228
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:20,420
casting is RNA editing system you know I

1229
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:23,089
have less interest in that because I

1230
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,260
have my own thinking and because I have

1231
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:26,269
synthetic artificial transferring

1232
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,640
factors I think those are really better

1233
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:30,829
to me you know two years on in cleavage

1234
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:32,539
in cleaving you know reagent but then

1235
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:35,210
there's other system of the company are

1236
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:40,059
developing so I have heard about but but

1237
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:40,059
these are more or less like CPF one yeah

1238
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:47,019
yes you want your slides you show the

1239
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:53,719
picture of hair which is a woody plant

1240
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:57,050
so for many plants with highly rights

1241
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:59,809
and self incompatible right so you think

1242
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:02,150
of the way to get around this issue look

1243
00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:07,360
to get rid off their guide array and and

1244
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:10,400
some astronaut and Jenny yes as a

1245
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:13,220
there's a lot of ways one way is give us

1246
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,320
DNA and maybe you can find some edits

1247
00:47:13,219 --> 00:47:17,029
but just happened to be no stable a you

1248
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,519
know you can use okay you can you can

1249
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:21,860
edit without the T DNA integration right

1250
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:24,050
other deal ever DNA but the gene be

1251
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,640
they're expressing the reagent but the

1252
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,380
DNA wouldn't be really inserting

1253
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:29,539
chromosomes and we're become you know

1254
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:31,280
after you you're making a path out and

1255
00:47:29,539 --> 00:47:33,110
then you can deliver with RNA but Ani is

1256
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,090
unstable right that's right people are

1257
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:37,280
more using an T the ribonucleotides

1258
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:39,260
delivery the you purify Cassadine

1259
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,880
protein and envy to just you know

1260
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:43,010
incubating tests to be with guide RNA

1261
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,170
and you boom bow is jingle all the way

1262
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:47,450
you know on nanoparticle to achieve that

1263
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:49,030
but to my understanding those things are

1264
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:52,029
being worked out but not official yet

1265
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,030
yeah

1266
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:10,340
this has been a production of Cornell
