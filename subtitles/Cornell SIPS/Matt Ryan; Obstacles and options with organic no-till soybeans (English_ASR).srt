1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,669
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,199
University okay so I think it's a little

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:09,449
after 11:00 so we are going to get

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,059
started this is the organic no-till

5
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:14,638
session so I hope everyone's having a

6
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,948
good time and enjoying what you've seen

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,528
so far but we're going to be talking

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,060
about organic no-till I'm gonna tell you

9
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,059
about my experiences and then we also

10
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,608
have some farmers who have been

11
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:31,348
practicing organic no-till for several

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:34,410
years now so just to start off how many

13
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:38,820
people have have worked with organic

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:41,339
no-till before a couple people okay yeah

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,159
so maybe half of you or so so this is a

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,629
different type of cropping system okay

17
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,328
I'm going to start off talking about

18
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:52,198
some of the the benefits here and then I

19
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:54,270
wanted to talk to you about sort of my

20
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,179
understanding of the systems of the

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,980
system to the at this point you know

22
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,840
we've had some challenges over the past

23
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,718
several years and I think there's like

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,478
great potential with organic no-till but

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,180
it takes a little bit of additional

26
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,728
management and a little forethought with

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,220
this so in terms of the benefits as you

28
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:16,140
can imagine having residue like this

29
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,908
like we're talking about with the soil

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,519
health session that could be really

31
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,960
beneficial for a number of reasons

32
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:25,649
certainly to protect against soil

33
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:28,859
erosion alright in the past year we've

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,469
seen quite a bit of a increase in the

35
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,239
extreme rainfall events you know five

36
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:34,828
inches of rain and within an hour you

37
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,868
know a farmer just down the road

38
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:40,319
experienced that a couple years ago a

39
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:43,069
lot of soil erosion there so having this

40
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,169
mulch there can certainly help with that

41
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:49,258
we can improve soil health improve water

42
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,659
infiltration and another big thing here

43
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,200
is reducing labor and fuel requirements

44
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,790
okay so in the past I've always kind of

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,290
assumed that there are the soil health

46
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,000
benefits you know I figured an you know

47
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,159
we can measure this but you know there's

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,459
this assumption that they will be there

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,340
and I was more focused on this you know

50
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,500
thinking that organic farmers they do a

51
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,170
lot of cultivation and if they can get

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,580
away from that cultivation that interval

53
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:17,519
tuition that they typically do in

54
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:21,650
soybean and rely on mulch then that

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,650
would be really beneficial for them so

56
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,080
so this is a photograph from down at

57
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,550
Penn State and we're happy to have Bill

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,880
Kern and Mary Barbra check in the room

59
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,459
who have worked in this system down at

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,349
Penn State and with organic rotational

61
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,759
no-till and I think it's important to

62
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:42,629
just recognize what we're talking about

63
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,859
here so typical organic management

64
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,829
starts with you know some moldboard

65
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,560
plowing most of the time some blind

66
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,239
cultivation either time weeding or

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,519
rotary hoeing and then in multiple

68
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,930
passes within a row cultivation and what

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,420
we're trying to do with this organic

70
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,330
no-till system is to reduce this

71
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:02,129
basically eliminate this and substitute

72
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,380
it with this system where we're rolling

73
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:07,259
down this cover crop and then no-till

74
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,959
planting crops like corn and soybean

75
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,818
behind it I'll just tell you right right

76
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,250
now that most of the presentation will

77
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:15,689
focus on soybean organic no tell soybean

78
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,909
we have done some work in organic

79
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:21,780
no-till corn it has not been successful

80
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:23,549
as successful we've yea experienced it

81
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,289
quite a bit of problems certainly in New

82
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,750
York it's even more challenging but

83
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:30,179
where we do see consistent success is

84
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,969
with organic no-till soybean in two

85
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,090
rolled cereal rye or rolled triticale

86
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:38,759
okay so here are some numbers from a

87
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,950
modeling exercise that we did looking at

88
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,439
a corn soybean wheat rotation and

89
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,839
comparing traditional tilled organic to

90
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,900
this organic no-till system and in this

91
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,390
comparison both the corn and the soybean

92
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,829
were no-till planted okay that was the

93
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,708
assumption that we were making there in

94
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:57,930
the model and compared to this with the

95
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,700
traditional tillage and we when we

96
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,640
compared to traditional tillage basis

97
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:05,339
man and management we see 27 percent

98
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:09,208
reduction in diesel fuel 31 percent

99
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,159
reduction in in labor okay and also some

100
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,259
other environmental benefits in terms of

101
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,228
reduced energy use and reduce greenhouse

102
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:19,529
gas emissions okay

103
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:22,978
so I'm going to be providing some of a

104
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,649
broad overview okay and you know I think

105
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,379
it's really important to think about

106
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:29,310
your cover

107
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:32,409
and consider your cover crop to be a

108
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,050
critical part of the system here

109
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,060
unlike other cropping systems where you

110
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,560
know your main focus is your cash crop

111
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,639
and you know if you're lucky and you

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,860
have some time then you put it in the

113
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,500
cash your cover crop after your your

114
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,970
cash crop is harvested you know this is

115
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,920
a bit different you know you really need

116
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,700
to be treating your cover crop like a

117
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,830
cash crop okay so what that means is

118
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,810
seeding early in the fall using good

119
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:59,680
seed so you can get a higher rate than

120
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,449
what you might normally do okay and so

121
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,079
these are some photographs from Klaus

122
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:07,029
Martin's farm here this is a when Jeff

123
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:08,469
Lieber graduate student in my lab was

124
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:10,929
doing some on-farm research with Cloths

125
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:14,380
looking at at barley and triticale and

126
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:17,829
rye and so this is classes tractor here

127
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:19,779
with a front-mounted roller okay and you

128
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:22,180
can see the different cover crops here

129
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:24,969
that were rolled down and now what we've

130
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,490
seen both down in Pennsylvania and up

131
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:30,310
here is that if you don't have the

132
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,620
timing right if you are not managing at

133
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:36,069
the correct time there's potential for

134
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,319
receding okay and this can be this can

135
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:41,050
be a problem in some situations maybe

136
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,659
not too much of a problem in others okay

137
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,460
so this is what this looks like so over

138
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,220
here this is done at Rock Springs in

139
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:51,129
Pennsylvania so this was a cereal rye

140
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,780
that was rolled too early and so

141
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:54,430
typically what we say is when you're

142
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:57,309
rolling it down you want to see pollen

143
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,040
okay so that's when you can consistently

144
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,800
kill it with a roller crimper

145
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,780
okay this cereal rye and it's so for

146
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,400
people that are allergic to cereal rye

147
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:08,829
you know that's can be really dangerous

148
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,899
and you know quite problematic but in

149
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:12,969
general you want your tractor covered in

150
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:15,039
pollen if you want to be doing it at if

151
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,560
you're doing it at the right time and so

152
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,200
this is why that was rolled too early

153
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,470
and bounced back and that rise going to

154
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:26,050
seed here this rye over here this was

155
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,320
rolled a little bit later and you can

156
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,550
see the effect of termination there okay

157
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,899
Clare keen it was a graduate student

158
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,389
with Bill Kern done it and Penn State

159
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:37,870
she just published a paper looking at

160
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:40,120
the effect of this this this bounce back

161
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,209
and this incomplete kill

162
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,209
and what can happen is if if this goes

163
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:47,529
to seed now and you can imagine that

164
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:49,418
there would be volunteer crops in the

165
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:51,759
future and so if you are following this

166
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:54,430
rotation following soybean with wheat

167
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,349
you know having that we consider that

168
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,490
rye contaminate your wheat can be a big

169
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:02,949
problem however if you're planting

170
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,870
triticale after this and you're

171
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,449
harvesting it for forage it may not be

172
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,340
such a big deal all right so really your

173
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,470
crop rotation kind of dictates how

174
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:17,138
important the the timing of that rolling

175
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:18,880
really is and so this the system it

176
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,009
requires a different approach so I

177
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,589
really want to emphasize this greater

178
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:26,918
attention to detail here advanced

179
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:28,810
planning and adaptive management so what

180
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:30,579
I mean by advanced planning when you're

181
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,829
thinking about doing this this organic

182
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:34,839
no-till soybeans system you really got a

183
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:36,279
plan ahead you got to be thinking about

184
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:39,429
when you're going to plant your cover

185
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:41,679
crop and so typically you need to be

186
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,168
ordering seed in July the year before

187
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,478
you are going to be planting your

188
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:49,509
soybean all right get your seed to the

189
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:52,149
ground get your ride growing or your

190
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,829
triticale and then adaptive management

191
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:57,098
you know that's something I think we

192
00:07:53,829 --> 00:08:00,310
need to pay more attention to you know

193
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:02,409
it really requires everything to line up

194
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,839
in the system for it to work well I'm

195
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,189
totally convinced it can work well there

196
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,799
are a lot of benefits and you can get

197
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:11,079
high yields in the system but it takes

198
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,500
everything to line up properly alright

199
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:16,418
and if things don't line up ok so say

200
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,098
you're prevented from planting your

201
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:19,899
cereal rye and you don't get it in too

202
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:23,139
late or if there's a problem heavy

203
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:24,759
rainfall and you have or bad seed and

204
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,939
you don't have a good stand you need to

205
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:31,029
change your plans and not proceed with

206
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:34,979
this so it's good to know what these

207
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:37,149
thresholds are alright so know when to

208
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,719
you know do something different no one

209
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:43,028
to plow ok so that's really important

210
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,760
and then equipment you know for this

211
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:47,230
system it takes different equipment so

212
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,879
we're using no-till planters that are

213
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,009
heavy to have a culture up front to cut

214
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,730
through that residue and then get good

215
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:56,000
seed to soil contact

216
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,379
okay and then unlike you know

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,909
traditional tillage based management

218
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:01,820
there are some different pests that we

219
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:04,939
have to deal with okay perennial weeds

220
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,040
can be worse in the system okay

221
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,750
early emerging weeds such as common

222
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,319
ragweed that's our number one weed

223
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:15,889
problem in this cereal rye rolled cereal

224
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,840
ride no-till soybeans system and the the

225
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:20,840
common ragweed is a problem because it

226
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,389
actually emerges and before the cereal

227
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,370
rise rolled down the cereal rise at a

228
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:27,679
stage that like I said with the when

229
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,409
it's going into an thesis and you see

230
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,839
pollen where it's very easy to kill that

231
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:35,569
mechanically when you have a little rye

232
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,330
seedling or a little ragweed seedling in

233
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,150
that rye the roller crimper will go

234
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,550
right over top of it and it'll go right

235
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:45,199
through that mulch and so it's this

236
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,819
these early emerging weeds that are

237
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,000
emerging before the cereal rice rolled

238
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,590
down that are problematic we also have a

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,480
number of different insect pests that

240
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:56,149
can be problematic

241
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,850
before coming to Cornell five years ago

242
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,649
I was working in Pennsylvania and it saw

243
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,810
problems with armyworm and black cutworm

244
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:05,539
and then just this past year working

245
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:08,059
with Janis dengue and a local farm in

246
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:09,439
Groton we saw a seed corn maggot and

247
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:11,599
that was the first time that I ever saw

248
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,490
a seed corn maggot but it is attracted

249
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,830
to this residue and so it's another

250
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:18,200
thing to watch out for when you're

251
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:24,800
thinking about organic rotational

252
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:27,410
no-till soybean okay just to point out

253
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,599
you know we do uh you know consider this

254
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:31,579
to be a rotational system here it's a

255
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,490
rotational no-till because of those

256
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,629
perennial weeds that I was mentioning if

257
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,659
if you're going to try to do continuous

258
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:39,950
organic no-till eventually you would

259
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:43,610
have perennial weeds that would come in

260
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:45,200
and tank the system and so we really

261
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,419
think that you need some level of

262
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,210
tillage at some point in the rotation of

263
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:52,879
course we want to minimize it okay let

264
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,620
that little bit of tillage once every

265
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,240
three years or so can be really

266
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,419
beneficial for managing those perennial

267
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,419
weeds

268
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:10,920
so crop selection a really important

269
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:13,019
factor here coming up from Pennsylvania

270
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,389
into New York I talked to a number of

271
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:17,699
people about organic no-till my plans to

272
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:19,439
start working with the system and I

273
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,300
would come across a lot of farmers that

274
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,160
said oh yeah you know I went down to

275
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,620
Burdell before I I saw their roller

276
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,838
crimper I've tried that up here and it

277
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,060
didn't work and what they would tell me

278
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,089
was that they would roll down rye and

279
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:34,799
no-till plant corn into it and I think

280
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:37,260
it's really important to recognize that

281
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,539
that's that's a bad approach I don't

282
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:42,419
think anyone that's working on organic

283
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:45,959
no-till it would ever recommend it that

284
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:46,379
and it's really because of nitrogen all

285
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,509
right

286
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,730
with soybean all right what we're trying

287
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:53,009
to do because soybean is a Legum right

288
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,370
it can fix its own nitrogen we really

289
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:58,889
want to make it work and there are

290
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,620
benefits with the Rye of with depleting

291
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:03,419
the soil nitrogen and so that has weed

292
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,019
suppression benefits and so that's

293
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:08,789
really the goal with with Rye to suck up

294
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,460
all of the nitrogen that's in the soil

295
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:13,829
and make that soybean more competitive

296
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,660
against weeds because the soybean can

297
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,370
fix its own nitrogen and if that

298
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:19,199
nitrogen is not there for the weeds it's

299
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,399
tied up in the Rye then that gives that

300
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,500
soybean a competitive advantage okay

301
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,480
now some people have talked about you

302
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,299
know trying to maximize your ride

303
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:34,159
biomass and adding nitrogen to do that

304
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:37,620
okay and I've I've shied away from that

305
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,730
we've are thinking now that maybe some

306
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,529
of these thresholds that have been

307
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,870
developed in terms of how much biomass

308
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,269
you need you know are not necessarily

309
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,889
appropriate for New York all right and

310
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:49,679
we'll talk a little bit about that later

311
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:51,419
but you know adding nitrogen to your

312
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,338
cover crops so then you can go plant a

313
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:56,729
soy bean to me it just doesn't make a

314
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:58,529
whole lot of sense and you you can run

315
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,870
into problems where your CEO or I can

316
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:02,970
lodge and you can also give those weeds

317
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:07,019
more of an advantage than they would

318
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:09,810
normally have okay but soybean in tirol

319
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,759
dry and if you are going to use corn

320
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:12,809
it's really important to go into a

321
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,600
legging cover crop

322
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:20,429
okay corn into R I typically fails maybe

323
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,139
non-organic farmers all right they can

324
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:23,609
put down starter fertilizer there's

325
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,649
certainly a lot of good planting green

326
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,860
farmers down in Pennsylvania that are

327
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:32,699
doing this corn into Rye but for organic

328
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:35,129
it's just really tough okay and so what

329
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,800
we say is that you know even with vetch

330
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:40,080
hairy vetch I I really like hairy vetch

331
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,349
I think it's a great cover crop there

332
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,900
are some problems with it in terms of it

333
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:48,210
becoming a weed certainly cost say that

334
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,949
he won't touch the stuff because he

335
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,290
grows a lot of small greens however if

336
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:54,660
you really want to do this system you

337
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:56,579
know with organic no-till corn you

338
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:00,719
should really be thinking about veg

339
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:02,670
okay and and not rye some mixtures of

340
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,379
hairy vetch and rye or hairy vetch and

341
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:06,959
triticale they might be beneficial in

342
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,639
terms of suppressing more weeds but

343
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,379
really you need to watch out that you

344
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,000
don't have too much of that small grain

345
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:14,490
in there or else you can have nitrogen

346
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,879
immobilization or nitrogen tie-up and it

347
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:22,710
really make your your corn crop suffer

348
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:23,850
okay so some of the other benefits with

349
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,009
the system as I was talking about

350
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,879
earlier with the extreme rain events in

351
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:32,639
the soil erosion we had a situation in

352
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:36,210
2015 or 2015 and and also this past year

353
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,779
where we had a very wet season in 2015

354
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:41,220
our June was particularly wet typically

355
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,549
we have four inches of rain at our

356
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:47,670
research farm we had double that in June

357
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:49,620
of 2015 and what was really amazing was

358
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:51,599
I was working with a graduate student

359
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,759
who was doing Jeff Lieber he was doing a

360
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,860
timing study of planting timing study

361
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,990
and he had four different termination

362
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,519
and planting dates and he was able to

363
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,190
nail every single one of those

364
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,720
termination and planting dates

365
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,480
throughout you know May and June even

366
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,279
with this wet weather because the Rye in

367
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,190
this system helped suck up that moisture

368
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,720
and allow us to access the field where

369
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,760
farmers that were working in tilled

370
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,060
brown or it did not have a cover crop

371
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,860
they were excluded from their field

372
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:21,509
field to just would bury their tractor

373
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,100
if they tried to go out there however we

374
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:26,870
were able to get out there and do it and

375
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:29,909
it worked really well so

376
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:32,129
here's some photographs comparing

377
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:34,919
tillage base management you know to the

378
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:38,909
organic no-till system here so you can

379
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:44,490
see the roll dry bare ground okay you

380
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:46,110
know this this erosion you this is this

381
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,519
area here this wasn't throughout the

382
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,350
whole entire field but we did see

383
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,970
patches of this certainly problematic

384
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,950
certainly don't want to see that didn't

385
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,759
see any of that in the organic no-till

386
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:58,440
roll dry system okay

387
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,689
here you can see that same area where

388
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,240
there's just a very poor drainage but no

389
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:07,620
problems with the organic no-till

390
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,810
soybean so in the past really thinking

391
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,620
about seeing these these observations

392
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:16,169
these effects with the cereal rye being

393
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,720
beneficial to deal with excessive rain

394
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:20,819
and so we always assumed that there was

395
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,740
um the these benefits and like I was

396
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,840
saying before I was more focused on the

397
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,580
labor and the energy use and just

398
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,470
recently started to get into looking at

399
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,720
the the soil health aspects of this and

400
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,300
trying to quantify the effects of soil

401
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,040
of this management system on soil health

402
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:38,099
and so I had another graduate student

403
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,649
Kiera Crowley and so she asked the

404
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,320
question you know compared to a no cover

405
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:45,750
crop control will integrating a cereal

406
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,060
rye cover crop prior to soybean improve

407
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,679
soil health weed suppression soybean

408
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:51,899
yield and profitability so those are the

409
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,879
metrics that she was looking at okay and

410
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,759
this was a research study that was done

411
00:16:53,879 --> 00:17:00,769
just north of here about a half hour or

412
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:03,330
hour at the musgrave research farm and

413
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:06,180
and so I'll show you some of her results

414
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,529
first the treatments so there are four

415
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,810
different treatments that were compared

416
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:11,639
and so we were very interested in this

417
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:14,099
roll down system the organic no-till

418
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,740
soybeans system here but she wanted to

419
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,269
compare that to standard management you

420
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,430
know a lot of organic farmers they would

421
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:23,190
put out a rye cover crop but then plow

422
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,720
that down and incorporate it incorporate

423
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,338
that right cover crop that jointing so

424
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,870
that's you know one control

425
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:30,089
there are certainly there are other

426
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,159
farmers may be non organic farmers that

427
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:34,019
are not using any cover crop so we

428
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,990
wanted to also include a no cover crop

429
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,619
control and then more recently there

430
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,789
have been

431
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:41,669
there's been a lot of interest in

432
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:45,149
harvesting cover crops for forage so she

433
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:46,740
included a violent treatment here to

434
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,660
compare so there is four different

435
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,058
treatments with the Rye ledge harvested

436
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,040
at a boot stage you know just like you

437
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:56,359
can see in the photograph here so these

438
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,889
are the four different systems and so

439
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,629
let's just take a look at this which

440
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,759
system do you think had the best soil

441
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:06,530
health here and we'll try to make this a

442
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:12,150
little bit more interactive any any

443
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:13,740
ideas about that roll down system right

444
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,640
okay what about what system you think

445
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,109
had the greatest profitability eyelids

446
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,509
okay yeah good you're following along

447
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:24,899
okay so let me just show you the numbers

448
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:26,940
here you know we had two years that were

449
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:30,360
very different from one another all

450
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,730
right and 2015 it was very wet like you

451
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,819
know was saying 2016 it was a drought

452
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,980
year alright so this is the the average

453
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:41,039
line here alright that's the normal

454
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,950
accumulation of precipitation all right

455
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:47,519
and throughout the spring and in the

456
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:51,058
growing season again 2015 being very wet

457
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,889
alright and 2016 being very dry so this

458
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:54,450
is a really good comparison here looking

459
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,190
at these two years to see how these

460
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,940
different systems to perform in these

461
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:02,160
contrasting environments okay so we're

462
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,880
seeing right over crop biomass and I

463
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,250
apologize for the metric units but I

464
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,470
think you can just assume that this says

465
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:13,069
pounds per acre okay they're very

466
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,808
similar those units and so you can see

467
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:19,079
there was a difference in years we had a

468
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:22,139
greater cereal rye biomass in the spring

469
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:24,599
of 2016 and that was really related to

470
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,850
the seeding date here okay the first

471
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,879
year we didn't get our rock cover crop

472
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:33,000
in early as we as early as we would have

473
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,580
liked and so we were suffering a bit

474
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,740
with that lower biomass in these three

475
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:39,509
different systems but the difference

476
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,579
between these treatments you know that's

477
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:44,250
all related to the different timings of

478
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:46,589
the management so higher biomass in the

479
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,799
roll-down system because we were waiting

480
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:50,879
to an thesis until that until we would

481
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:53,579
terminate that cover crop

482
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,680
this was terminated a bit earlier the

483
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:59,669
rila and the plow down was terminated

484
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:02,100
just prior to jointing okay so that's

485
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,259
the rye biomass and biomass increase

486
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:07,319
with termination date right and so

487
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,779
here's a soil respiration data okay so

488
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:11,759
what we do see is that there's it looks

489
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:13,680
like there's a trend okay but when we

490
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,720
look at the statistics we see that there

491
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,060
is a difference all right between the

492
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,559
roll-down system and then no cover okay

493
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,369
these other treatments here where

494
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,099
intermediate

495
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:25,109
okay but this microbial respiration this

496
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:26,309
is one of the soil health indicators and

497
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:29,819
we were talking about earlier in the

498
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:31,950
soil health session and this just goes

499
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,960
to show you that there is some activity

500
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,330
some more microbial activity that's

501
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,299
happening in the soil and that that this

502
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:41,689
ride especially in the roll down system

503
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:44,450
having that mulch there is helping

504
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:48,960
promote those and maintain those

505
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:52,319
beneficial microorganisms okay

506
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,090
sorptivity this is a metric of water

507
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,269
infiltration so higher sorptivity

508
00:20:54,089 --> 00:21:00,269
greater water infiltration okay and what

509
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:02,579
we're seeing here is compared to the the

510
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:04,319
no cover okay we see greater water

511
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:06,000
infiltration in the roll-down system

512
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,149
compared to the no cover where these

513
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,759
other two are intermediate okay and when

514
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,930
we do have these extreme rain events we

515
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,329
think that this is going to be really

516
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:18,600
important okay people that have the

517
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:21,419
rolled roll dry system and that have

518
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,639
that mulch there and protecting their

519
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,529
soil more water is going to go into the

520
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,690
soil less if it's going to go off and

521
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:33,359
take your soil with it okay

522
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:38,850
we'd buy a mess okay so these other

523
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:41,490
systems all right all using all using

524
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:44,159
mechanical cultivation so no cover plow

525
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,440
down mileage so we went through use

526
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,850
moldboard plow tillage did some blind

527
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,259
cultivation and then inter-row

528
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:51,779
cultivation standard management

529
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:54,150
practices for organic farmers and then

530
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,849
the no-till was obviously that mulch

531
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:59,310
that we were relying on for the weeds

532
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:01,069
but here you know you can see a lot more

533
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:04,250
weed biomass

534
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:08,240
in the roll down for anybody who knows

535
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:11,869
anything about weed biomass in these

536
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,210
units and has experience on organic

537
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:16,518
farms you would know that these levels

538
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:20,419
are extremely low okay

539
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:23,480
so 300 or 500 kilograms per hectare of

540
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,740
weed biomass that's that's really not a

541
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,620
whole lot of biomass at all

542
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,450
so we were quite happy even though the

543
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:31,250
spar is so much higher than these you're

544
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:35,509
still getting very good weed suppression

545
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:37,808
for an organic situation okay does that

546
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:37,808
make sense

547
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:42,649
right right exactly I mean this yeah

548
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:45,019
this is the type of weed suppression

549
00:22:42,648 --> 00:22:49,158
that you might expect you know yeah a

550
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:51,109
herbicide based system right yeah yeah

551
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,179
and please as we go on and you'll feel

552
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:55,178
free to ask a question or shout out to

553
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:57,679
comment okay

554
00:22:55,179 --> 00:23:01,879
so these are the treatments just prior

555
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,409
to harvest and this is 2015 we did one

556
00:23:01,878 --> 00:23:05,719
other thing that I didn't tell you about

557
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:09,139
we actually interceded some hairy vetch

558
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,850
into these plots okay and that's just I

559
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:13,308
just want to explain what that green is

560
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:14,538
those aren't weeds that's interceded

561
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,460
hairy vetch I'm not going to spend too

562
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:17,829
much time talking about that but I think

563
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,819
there's a lot of potential with

564
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:22,220
interceding and actually using hairy

565
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:25,099
vetch in this particularly in this

566
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:28,669
organic no-till system to get a cover

567
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:31,788
crop established alright so this is the

568
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:35,210
the rough year here the drought year

569
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:36,798
okay so very good production you know

570
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,079
with the no cover with the plow down and

571
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:43,278
the Rye llege nice soybeans and then we

572
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:45,769
just had a mess over here the the

573
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,378
soybeans all right we planted them

574
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:51,649
no-till planted them into very very dry

575
00:23:48,378 --> 00:23:53,778
conditions that seed sat there we didn't

576
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:55,548
get any rain afterwards you know for you

577
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:58,878
know no kind of measurable amount of

578
00:23:55,548 --> 00:24:00,888
rain for a month or so and and those

579
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:02,269
soybeans just took they were stunted

580
00:24:00,888 --> 00:24:06,048
they weren't growing as fast so the

581
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:10,269
growth rate was much slower and and our

582
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:10,269
yields were we're lower as you'll see

583
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:18,259
that is that is interceded hairy vetch

584
00:24:14,058 --> 00:24:18,889
here yeah okay also some some weeds in

585
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:20,808
there as well

586
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,220
the vets wasn't counted in the weed

587
00:24:20,808 --> 00:24:29,240
biomass sides that I was just showing

588
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:35,000
you okay we use a high clearance drill

589
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:37,640
interceder so we will see one tomorrow

590
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,349
if you go on the tour you know see one

591
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,500
in action rod Porter brought one it down

592
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:48,369
yeah or or right yeah bill Kearns talk

593
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:48,369
you know in the interceding session yeah

594
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:13,788
so say that again so you're seeing yeah

595
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:22,589
in the note tells in the mulch system

596
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:25,798
yeah you know we do see that you know we

597
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:27,269
seek a side-by-side our soybeans you

598
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:29,220
know getting yellow we're reaching

599
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:31,919
yellow leaf drop about a week or two

600
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,868
earlier than in the the no-till system

601
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,788
you know and so I'm not quite sure

602
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:48,720
what's going on there but then that is

603
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:50,819
pretty consistent I'd say yeah exactly

604
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,129
so it's something that we try to avoid

605
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:55,470
you know with the having that mulch

606
00:25:53,128 --> 00:25:59,819
cover up all of the soil there okay so

607
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:04,048
let me just show you the yields so in 20

608
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:06,898
2015 again the I have this reference

609
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:09,989
line of 45 bushels per acre here but

610
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:11,998
soybean yields I'd say for for us you

611
00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:16,619
know I under any conditions you know we

612
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:18,419
were happy with this in 2015 in 2016 we

613
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:20,519
were really disappointed and again it's

614
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,710
just because those soybeans had such a

615
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:25,919
rough start in that dry conditions in

616
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:28,169
that that dry soil and and rye that was

617
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,619
there that they were stunted and they

618
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:33,659
just never caught up and so you know I

619
00:26:31,618 --> 00:26:36,138
think this is really important to

620
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:39,509
recognize here that there are challenges

621
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:41,278
before 2016 I was going around talking

622
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:43,798
about organic no-till soybean as a

623
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:45,329
solution to climate change you know all

624
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:47,999
the problems associated with climate

625
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:50,278
change and I thought okay well you know

626
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:52,858
in the Northeast our problems are too

627
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:56,128
much water in the spring and not enough

628
00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:57,989
water midseason all right and under you

629
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,248
know the roll-down system that's where

630
00:26:57,989 --> 00:27:00,659
it really shines you know we have too

631
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:02,970
much water in the spring the rice sucks

632
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:06,210
up that moisture okay and then having

633
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,679
that mulch there in midsummer that's

634
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,348
where it really conserves that soil

635
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,399
moisture and that's really beneficial

636
00:27:09,348 --> 00:27:13,378
however this year really caught me by

637
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:15,849
surprise with this drought drought

638
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:18,399
conditions in the spring in June

639
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:21,849
you know so basically no no water in

640
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,559
2016 in June and and that you know

641
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,659
people talk about the the dangers of

642
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:29,019
cover crops in the West you know under

643
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,919
dry rain-fed conditions and you know I'd

644
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:31,839
never really thought that we've

645
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,549
experienced that here but here it is and

646
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,939
it was certainly a problem and something

647
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:39,460
to avoid okay

648
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:43,058
so summary of our results from Cara's

649
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,679
work so profitability as you expected it

650
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:47,230
was greatest in the Riley treatment and

651
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,610
if you can make use of that Riley sir

652
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,169
and then get a soybean and crop in

653
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:51,219
afterwards you know I think that's

654
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,710
really nice

655
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,759
there were trends in soil health and and

656
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,288
some of those other indicators that

657
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:58,720
we're looking at where it might be

658
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,710
better might just need more data to to

659
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,409
look at that to see if there are

660
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:05,740
actually differences more weeds in the

661
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:06,429
roll-down system lowest costs in the the

662
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:11,099
no cover

663
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:11,100
but lowest labor in the roll down okay

664
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,109
so i was thinking about you know the

665
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,070
messages that i want to convey to you

666
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:22,569
and thinking about these indicators and

667
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:23,859
thresholds that we have and i think it's

668
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:26,319
really important like i was saying to

669
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:28,178
know when to pull the plug or you know

670
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,038
if you're in a kenny rogers fan and you

671
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:32,650
you know that song the gambler you know

672
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:34,329
you know when to fold them okay you know

673
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,190
when to hold them but you also need to

674
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:38,259
know when to fold them and i'd say if

675
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:41,169
you you know this will prevent a lot of

676
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:42,579
problems you know i think people come to

677
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:44,890
sessions like this and hear about

678
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:46,178
organic no-till to get excited and they

679
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,549
go out and they try to do it on all

680
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:50,620
their land or in areas where maybe they

681
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:52,538
shouldn't try it and so what we're

682
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:55,239
suggesting is that people really avoid

683
00:28:52,538 --> 00:28:58,298
weedy fields alright don't try to put

684
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:01,390
this in a field that you've consistently

685
00:28:58,298 --> 00:29:03,099
had problems with you certainly want to

686
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,919
avoid field to have a lot of perennial

687
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:10,000
weeds in them i was talking with a

688
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,750
farmer you know i guess um well further

689
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,690
west of here

690
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:17,919
and he took CRP land i'm not sure if tom

691
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:20,590
tom was in the room but you took CRP

692
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,770
land planted rye and then did a no-till

693
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:25,990
soybean into it and it's really exciting

694
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:28,000
he was a very enthusiastic about it he

695
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,750
was um this is some of his first

696
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,940
experience with farming and

697
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,950
he wanted to do it this way but he had a

698
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,289
lot of perennial weeds and you could

699
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,910
imagine coming out of CRP land you know

700
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:39,829
this Conservation Reserve Program that

701
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:43,730
you just have a buildup of perennial

702
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:45,409
propagules and fortunately he was

703
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,059
successful I think he's getting a good

704
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:49,700
crop and he's got a nice price for his

705
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,899
beans but it could have been a lot

706
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,340
better if he would have went into a

707
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,950
field or tried to deal with those weeds

708
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:57,789
beforehand all right and then if you

709
00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:00,830
will realize for one reason or another

710
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:02,569
that your cover crop is just not going

711
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:05,000
to do it you know it's not going to cut

712
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:07,279
it because it's too sparse or too thin

713
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,130
all right as you can see in this cover

714
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,529
crop okay these are weeds that's black

715
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,510
medic that's not not clover there that's

716
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:16,730
uh those are weeds and so if you're in a

717
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:18,140
situation like this you know I think

718
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,200
it's just really good to recognize and

719
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,490
to change plans adapt okay you know you

720
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,559
might have had the best intention to

721
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,609
doing some organic no-till but at this

722
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,740
point you should really be thinking

723
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:29,119
about either harvesting the Rye or

724
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,339
plowing it down or doing something

725
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,019
different mowing it all right because if

726
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:34,819
you try to roll it down and you try to

727
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:41,000
no-till plants hoping into it you're

728
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:43,490
going to have weed problems so again

729
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,369
thinking about this year and and the

730
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:48,319
these messages that I want to get across

731
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:53,119
if you're in a really dry situation like

732
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:55,939
we were in in 20 2016 all right so no no

733
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,369
rain for a couple weeks before before

734
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,380
termination but before when you would

735
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:03,559
normally plant and no rain in the

736
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:06,350
forecast and I say either wait for rain

737
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:08,210
or harvest for grain okay at that point

738
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:10,399
you know when you want to no-till plant

739
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,920
your your soybeans it may be too late to

740
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,840
harvest that that ri4 violets and for

741
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,370
forage all right at that point you might

742
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,319
just be better off harvesting it for

743
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:20,689
grain and then going in with a different

744
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:24,289
crop sorghum Sudan grass or something

745
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:27,350
else okay extra weight so this is um

746
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:28,849
from Penn State you know putting I think

747
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:30,799
bags of seed or fertilizer on the

748
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:33,349
planter to get some extra weight because

749
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,569
the the soil was so dry here and to get

750
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:37,789
that that Coulter into the ground and to

751
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:41,109
get better seed to soil contact and seed

752
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:41,109
placement okay

753
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:47,149
so fitting into a crop rotation this is

754
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:49,759
another issue that often comes up they

755
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:52,190
say okay well this sounds really good so

756
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,619
how do I fit this into my corn soybean

757
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,630
wheat rotation and in New York it's

758
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:58,159
really challenging to do that so we've

759
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:59,900
been thinking trying to put our heads

760
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,610
together working with our organic farmer

761
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,309
advisory board and trying to really

762
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:06,500
think about how how can you sneak in

763
00:32:04,308 --> 00:32:08,450
some organic no-till into your crop

764
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,490
rotation or how can you redesign your

765
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:13,429
your rotation so that you can

766
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,720
accommodate this and so the problem is

767
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:17,030
that you really need to establish your

768
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,490
cereal rye early that's critical so

769
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:20,839
early September is ideal all right and

770
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,519
after corn green and it just doesn't

771
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,869
work you're not going to get the stand

772
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:26,869
that you need for that weed suppression

773
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:28,279
after corn green so you need to think

774
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:30,169
about doing something different you know

775
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,428
you can't have soybean after corn if you

776
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,230
want to do this and you're harvesting

777
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:37,370
your corn for grain and you're in the

778
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:39,079
north ok what people are thinking about

779
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:41,928
it what we're looking at is you know

780
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:43,990
following you know or some of the issues

781
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:46,429
with following organic no-till soybean

782
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:48,500
you know if you are going in with wheat

783
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:52,240
that's something that some people try to

784
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:55,009
do it's challenging even in a even in a

785
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,140
tilled organic system you know let alone

786
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:59,269
a system where the maturity is delayed

787
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,190
and you may be pushed back and your

788
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:03,109
harvest in a little bit later but just

789
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,940
in general it's challenging around here

790
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:08,119
to get your wheat in on time after

791
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:10,970
soybeans the other issue with that

792
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,799
cereal rye that residue there there can

793
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,779
be a bit of a green bridge and what

794
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,759
we've seen in some cases is if you go in

795
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:19,399
with wheat afterwards and you have a lot

796
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:22,009
of residue you can get you know diseases

797
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,050
like take all that can go in and be a

798
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:25,940
problem for your wheat crop so this

799
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:27,980
rotation of corn soybean wheat really

800
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,690
challenging there could be volunteer

801
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,730
rice seedlings like I was talking about

802
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,110
earlier you know if you have rye in your

803
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:36,410
wheat you know that can be problematic

804
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:37,428
especially if you're hoping to do

805
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,830
something if you're growing for a

806
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:42,110
food-grade market or something like that

807
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:43,460
and triticale you know might be a better

808
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:46,279
option ok

809
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:48,740
following soybean so you harvest your

810
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:50,389
soybean you have some time to put in

811
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,450
something you know but it might be too

812
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,040
late for for wheat

813
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,670
by triticale you can plan a little bit

814
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:59,829
later and the volunteer I see links in a

815
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:03,130
triticale forage crop are not going to

816
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:04,689
be as problematic okay so no big deal if

817
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:06,280
you have five volunteers in with your

818
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:11,019
triticale if you're harvesting it for

819
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:12,369
forage right okay so this is a rotation

820
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:14,679
that we're looking at in the organic

821
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:17,019
cropping systems experiment at the

822
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,949
Musgrave research farm and so we have

823
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:23,170
corn if you will up here at one o'clock

824
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:26,739
so I call this a rotation clock but it's

825
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:30,639
four years and one two three four start

826
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:32,919
with corn over here and intercede or not

827
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,929
but the next crop after that would be

828
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,240
sorghum Sudan grass again to give you

829
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:39,219
some time separate the corn and soybean

830
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:42,579
so you have some time to plant your

831
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:44,379
cereal rye on time okay around here

832
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:46,360
there are markets for circumcision grass

833
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,430
you know for forage a lot of people are

834
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,650
getting into double cropping a lot a lot

835
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:53,799
of dairies around here so there is a way

836
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:56,769
to utilize this and and then your cereal

837
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,470
rye going into soybean here you roll it

838
00:34:56,769 --> 00:35:01,360
down and then triticale after triticale

839
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:03,669
harvested for forage you know if you fra

840
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,640
seed and seed some red clover into that

841
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,950
you go back to corn grain that way okay

842
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,929
so this is something that we're actively

843
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:12,339
looking at we don't have a lot of data

844
00:35:10,929 --> 00:35:13,659
on this yet but we think that this is

845
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,730
going to be a lot better than trying to

846
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:17,799
cram things in with a corn soybean wheat

847
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:20,139
rotation and even though we're taking an

848
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,460
extra year growing forage crops we think

849
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:22,960
we're going to be better off in terms of

850
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,420
weed suppression and overall

851
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,829
profitability you know of course you

852
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,599
need to have a market for those crops

853
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:32,429
for that forage and a way to utilize

854
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:36,339
them but around here it's seems feasible

855
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:40,359
okay so how much time do I have and what

856
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:43,960
it where I'm really over okay okay so

857
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,970
I'm going to slow down here and I do

858
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,400
have some more more slides for the rest

859
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:50,739
of the time here it's going to be a bit

860
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,470
of a discussion we have a cost margin

861
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:55,269
she's going to talk for a bit about his

862
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:58,029
experiences and his thoughts on this

863
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:59,619
system we can always come back to some

864
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:02,740
of the slides I'm happy to talk about

865
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:04,000
this and if I'm thinking if cost brings

866
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:05,559
up something or if bill brings up

867
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,829
something and I have a slide that may be

868
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,739
how

869
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:11,579
fool to explain it I'll just throw it up

870
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:15,150
but close I'll turn it over to you and

871
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:15,150
yeah we'll take it from here

872
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:27,730
this has been a production of Cornell
