1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,439
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,439
university

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
really delighted today to introduce

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,479
three of

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,679
our really excellent scholars here at

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,278
cornell

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,839
that we'll be talking on the topic of

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,079
cobit 19 and the resilience of

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,640
global agricultural systems so we all

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,399
know that lots of things have changed

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,000
lots of things have been jeopardized a

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,038
lot of things have held up and we've

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,518
learned a lot of lessons

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,280
since since march about the the

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,320
resilience of our ag systems and how

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
covet 19

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,600
has played out in different parts of the

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,120
globe so

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,120
the what the panel will do today is

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,038
step through three geographic case

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,078
studies um

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,520
asia africa and upstate new york and

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,280
then we're going to pivot into some

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,239
pre-planned questions and then have some

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,439
time at the end

26
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,320
for for open uh q a so if you do have

27
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,359
questions

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,679
please if you think you're going to

29
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,119
forget them pop them into the chat

30
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,920
and we'll make sure that we've returned

31
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:07,118
to them at the end but i'm delighted to

have the the three excellent scholars

33
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,560
on the panel today rachel besner kerr is

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,478
a professor

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,799
in the department of global development

36
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,079
ed mabaya is a senior research associate

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,880
also in the department of global

38
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,118
development

39
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,879

the dyson school but also with a joint

41
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,158
appointment in global development

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,200
so rachel will be speaking about uh

43
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,400
upstate new york

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,960
ed focusing on africa and probably on

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
india the asian context and then they

46
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,759
will be fielding questions from more of

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,159
a global perspective

48
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,079
after they uh do some some case study

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,920
review for those geographies

50
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,078

so probably the floor is yours

56
00:01:53,599 --> 00:02:00,158
all right great to be here

57
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:03,280
um excited to talk to the

58
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,159
soil and crop science seminars series

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,318
here

60
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,760
um as andrew said i'd like to talk about

61
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,560
asia and specifically about what's

62
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,639
happened with

63
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,280
the covet crisis and how it's affected

64
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,519
food systems in india let me give you a

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,400
bottom line here

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,439
my bottom line is i have been

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,840
enormously surprised by

68
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,159
how resilient the food systems in india

69
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,439
have been to the crisis

70
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:40,878
and i'll show you some data on that but

71
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,840
i've been been extremely concerned about

72
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:47,840
the humanitarian impact of the crisis

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,200
which has been primarily the result of

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,400
a reverse migration

75
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,878
of millions of poor people from

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
urban areas back to their rural

77
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:02,158
households

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,599
in a totally unplanned manner

79
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,840
and the government did not program this

80
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,759
and did not really think through the

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,319
implications of this

82
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,158
and the long-term impact of this reverse

83
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,119
migration is something that

84
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:19,598
we'll have to keep watching and seeing

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,200
what happens over time

86
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:26,318
the third impact i

87
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:29,679
see is long-term

88
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:32,958
chronic impacts on nutrition

89
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,560
especially child nutrition and that's

90
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,000
coming about

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,158
because of disruptions and

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,039
some of the safety net programs

93
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:46,079
especially focused on children

94
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,239
in india today so i'll be coming to all

95
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,519
of those issues as we go through this

96
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,759
talk

97
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,719
which i hope to do very quickly but just

98
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,079
to give you

99
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,598
a timeline here um as you know the

100
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,519
crisis started

101
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:03,039
in december in china india got its first

102
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,200
case by the end of

103
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:09,120
january by mid-march there were about 50

104
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,919
cases in india

105
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,599
and then india went into an absolute

106
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,039
total lockdown

107
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,478
with less than 24 hours notice by march

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,840
25th

109
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,319
and it went through those lockdowns

110
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,560
tried to come out went back in and all

111
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,439
the way up till

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,079
mid august they were in the lockdown

113
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,560
mode and

114
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,560
finally just came out because there was

115
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,759
no way you can keep a billion people

116
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,959
locked down for

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:42,000
forever and um

118
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,719
and you know during that period of

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,918
lockdown

120
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,680
the indian coveted numbers were actually

121
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:52,879
not too bad but once the lockdown

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,000
stopped those numbers of skyrockets

123
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:58,639
skyrocketed and today india is i think

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
number three or number two depending on

125
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,800
who's counting

126
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,199
in terms of total number of cases around

127
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,360
the world so it's it's a massive problem

128
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,800
it's an ongoing problem

129
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,400
um that we're observing and and my group

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,600
the data cornell institute

131
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,959
is keeping a track of this as we go

132
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,759
along

133
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:25,599
um just to start with an advertisement

134
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,080
um we put out a fairly detailed report

135
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,360
on

136
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:32,079
pandemic prices and their implications

137
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,720
for nutrition security in india

138
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,519
a fairly data intensive document that's

139
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,440
available on our website

140
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:45,839
that document went up till

141
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:47,680
end of may and we haven't updated it but

142
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,038
we've been keeping track of the data

143
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,759
since then

144
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,399
so we hope we'll be able to do an

145
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,479
updated

146
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,839
version of this document which basically

147
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,758
looks at

148
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,279
what's happened to food supply food

149
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,560
prices

150
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,399
um the urban food supply chain

151
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,560
and then looked at the safety net

152
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,638
programs in india the

153
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,680
the subsidized food grain distribution

154
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,879
system the

155
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,519
public distribution system the pds and

156
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,918
also

157
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:20,959
the the child development program

158
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:23,279
uh in india which is a very large

159
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,478
integrated child development program

160
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,000
that runs across

161
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:31,038
rural areas in india and and how that's

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,240
been fairing and the midday meal scheme

163
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,279
in schools in india which is a really

164
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,720
important part of

165
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:41,439
nutrition and how they've been the big

166
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,840
story of course is the reverse migration

167
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,038
and the loss of income and remittances

168
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,918
which we talked through

169
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,000
also and so those of you are interested

170
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,439
it's available on the

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,879
the tata cornell institute website and

172
00:06:53,439 --> 00:07:00,478
you can download it for free

173
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:03,279
so one of the the the issues that we've

174
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:07,038
looked at in great detail

175
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:09,439
is what's happening to urban food prices

176
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:13,439
so we tracked

177
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:16,478
major urban food markets

178
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,478
across the country and we've tracked

179
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,279
them on a weekly basis

180
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,918
from march all the way through we're

181
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,559
still

182
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,879
doing the tracking now and we've tracked

183
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,918
them for all the major commodities and

184
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,319
i'm just giving you some examples here

185
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,038
we track them for stable grains

186
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,879
for pulses which is a really important

187
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:40,399
part of the protein

188
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:43,120
diet in india vegetables meat milk

189
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,239
etc and what we've done is we've

190
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,038
compared

191
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
the weekly data against the same week

192
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,360
last year

193
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,519
to see what the differences have been

194
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,639
and interestingly enough if you look at

195
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:01,198
staples there's been

196
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,720
very marginal change that took place in

197
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,960
staple grains

198
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:12,960
and also fairly small change in pulses

199
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:15,198
the bigger change has been in um sorry

200
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,079
the bigger change has been in vegetables

201
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,360
vegetables

202
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:22,878
saw a fairly dramatic shift

203
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,160
upwards in prices uh during the

204
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,360
early part of the the

205
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,879
lockdown period but then after that

206
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,399
um by mid-may

207
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,278
prices started to come down quite

208
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,599
significantly and today vegetable prices

209
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,000
are fairly close to

210
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,200
what they were at the same time last

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,320
year

212
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,720
and and that's because

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,120
the government very quickly made a

214
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,278
decision that

215
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,480
if we want to keep urban populations

216
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:01,120
food secure and happy

217
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,000
we better open up the food markets and

218
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,039
so they made

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,480
food mark food traders

220
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,958
essential service providers and so

221
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,399
the supply chains that were broken in

222
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,679
the early part of the

223
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,519
lockdown opened up and so you began to

224
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:21,120
see supplies coming in

225
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,399
and markets functioning fairly regularly

226
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,879
um with with or without masks for

227
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,919
people who are going to them and so

228
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,120
prices came down

229
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:34,639
quite significantly after that

230
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,159
now the real challenge has been

231
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:42,319
with employment and and you see

232
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:45,120
here oops sorry now you see that um

233
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,720
there was a sharp rise in unemployment

234
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,639
rates that took place

235
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,120
just as the lockdown happened and

236
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,480
and the primary reason for that is a

237
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,679
large part of

238
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:02,000
the labor force

239
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:05,359
is this casual labor daily labor

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,159
semi-skilled labor that's migrated from

241
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,480
rural areas into urban areas

242
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:13,759
and and even in rural areas in the

243
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,440
smaller towns etc much of the labor

244
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:19,039
that's employed is in this

245
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,160
non-contractual or semi-contractual

246
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,399
arrangements

247
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,360
so when the lockdown happened all of

248
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,200
those jobs

249
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,480
disappeared overnight and and then

250
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,440
that started this massive movement of

251
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,560
populations

252
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,560
back into rural areas and there was no

253
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,679
transport systems

254
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,479
no railways no buses nothing so a lot of

255
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,838
people actually

256
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,800
walked several days to get back it was

257
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,800
fairly sad and major

258
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,639
humanitarian disaster

259
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,319
when you think about it and think about

260
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,879
how that had happened

261
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,000
but the longer term implications of that

262
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,958
was it had

263
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,759
a significant in effect on the income

264
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,799
that goes to rural households

265
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:10,159
because with the loss in employment

266
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,078
much of the the remittance income that

267
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,600
rural households depend on for their

268
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,559
food consumption

269
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,480
and other consumption dropped overnight

270
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,399
and you saw a big drop

271
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:26,079
in overall consumption that happened

272
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,600
they we've been using monthly data that

273
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,559
comes out of

274
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,839
the survey that cuts across the whole

275
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,679
country

276
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:39,279
uh it's a consumer monitoring survey

277
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:41,519
and we're waiting the last round that we

278
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,120
have access to is from june and so we're

279
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,360
looking for we'll be waiting for the

280
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,078
next round to come in

281
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,278
and what we saw initially was this

282
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,799
dramatic drop

283
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:56,078
in in overall food expenditures

284
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:59,679
for all the different food groups and

285
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,559
what's interesting is that the drop for

286
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,278
staples

287
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,759
was much smaller than the drop for some

288
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:09,360
of the other major food groups

289
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:12,399
and also interesting is the drop in

290
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,440
food consumption was much higher in

291
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,879
urban areas

292
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,079
than in rural areas but i suspect we're

293
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,480
going to see a change

294
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,159
now we're going to as we see the next

295
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,240
round coming in

296
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,480
i think the bigger change we'll see is

297
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,320
in some of the more

298
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,278
nutritious food groups such as

299
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,120
vegetables pulses etc and rural areas

300
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,278
relative to urban areas and that's

301
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,320
primarily because of this

302
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,799
income change that's happened this

303
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,959
remittance income once we get the next

304
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,559
round of data we'll be able to separate

305
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,518
out the effect of the

306
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,078
supply chain disruption and the price

307
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,278
rise

308
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,159
relative to the income drop and my

309
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,320
hypothesis

310
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,600
is that that income drop is going to be

311
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,800
a much bigger

312
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,639
driver of the consumption change that

313
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,599
we're going to see

314
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,560
um what happened to the safety net

315
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,519
programs

316
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,838
now so as i mentioned earlier the the

317
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,959
public distribution system of subsidized

318
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,959
food grains

319
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,638
is one of the largest safety net

320
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,399
programs in the world

321
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:22,560
that india provides around 15 kg

322
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,799
of free or almost free rice or wheat to

323
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,799
to every household in rural areas in

324
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:30,078
india per month

325
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:32,319
now with the when the crisis happened

326
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,719
because of this movement of populations

327
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,720
back into rural areas they actually

328
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,639
added another

329
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,440
15 kg additional amounts to this

330
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,440
subsidized grain that was provided we've

331
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,360
done a telephone survey across

332
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,199
a sample of households that we've been

333
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,560
working with in india

334
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:55,759
and we've asked specifically about their

335
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,559
access to this subsidized grain and all

336
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,879
of them

337
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,599
i mean generally the majority reported

338
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,519
that they had

339
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,519
no problem in getting access to this

340
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,639
grain and so

341
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,879
from a purely hunger point of view

342
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,919
calorie hunger point of view

343
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,078
we've not seen a dramatic

344
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,120
increase in hunger in india despite the

345
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,159
crisis

346
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,159
so that's actually good news but on the

347
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,278
bad news side

348
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:27,439
the drop in the icds program

349
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:30,958
which runs the child welfare schemes and

350
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,079
child nutrition schemes those programs

351
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,719
were closed down

352
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,159
and the midday meal program in schools

353
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,440
was closed down

354
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:43,278
and so access to food and nutrition for

355
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,040
children became a major issue and

356
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:48,399
continues to be a major issue

357
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:51,599
so my concern is not

358
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,639
so much about hunger my concern is

359
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,839
long-term nutritional implications for

360
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,399
children especially children under five

361
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,600
and

362
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:05,278
then the effects on stunting etc

363
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,278
that can come in from that

364
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,759
and and of course the migration issue

365
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,519
continues to be

366
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:15,519
a major concern as we look ahead

367
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,720
many of these people are still in rural

368
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,720
areas they haven't

369
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,000
gone back into the cities the cities

370
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,278
haven't

371
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,639
generated that employment opportunities

372
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,399
as they used to in the past and so you

373
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,278
still have a whole

374
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,320
set of family members who are stuck

375
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,838
stuck in

376
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,600
at home and they need to be fed

377
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,240
but they're also going to start

378
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,360
competing in the rural labor market

379
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,639
and this can have a fairly depressing

380
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,159
effect on

381
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,039
wages and rural areas it can also

382
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,759
affect marginal working population

383
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,480
especially

384
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,480
rural women who depend on

385
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,198
employment for weeding and harvesting

386
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,480
and transplanting

387
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:06,399
etc for their incomes and now that

388
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,240
there's additional family labor

389
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,720
available at home much of the

390
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,440
direct employment for these rural women

391
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,800
may be

392
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,480
affected so i'm really concerned about

393
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,359
what are some of the

394
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,159
the longer term implications of this

395
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,440
reverse migration that's happened

396
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:30,240
and whether we can create new

397
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,480
and uh and better employment

398
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,079
opportunities for these populations

399
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,079
in the villages or in the

400
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,480
neighborhood towns etc rather than

401
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,599
having them go all the way back into

402
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,480
mumbai and

403
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,199
delhi etc that's a challenge i think the

404
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,259
government needs to be thinking through

405
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,399
so basically from

406
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:54,879
[Music]

407
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,799
to conclude on the implications for food

408
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,519
security

409
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,319
i think the staple grain prices have

410
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,400
remained

411
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,640
fairly stable and the vegetables and

412
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,000
other nutritional crops are coming

413
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,799
back towards uh normal trends so it

414
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,759
seeks it speaks to fairly significant

415
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:19,759
resilience for the food system itself

416
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:22,240
uh whether the supply disruptions

417
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,599
will continue into the future in urban

418
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,400
areas

419
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,198
if this crisis continues is a question

420
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,000
mark but my

421
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,600
in my view i think we're not going to

422
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,319
see that disruptions in food supplies

423
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,000
what we're going to see is the

424
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,119
implications for

425
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,880
unemployment continuing to be high the

426
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,439
loss of remittance income

427
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,400
continuing to be high and that affects

428
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,759
food access

429
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,960
and diets and diet diversity

430
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,160
and the impact of the shock on diet

431
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,160
quality

432
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,720
is something that we should be worried

433
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,000
about especially when you think about

434
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,640
children and child nutrition

435
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,279
so those of you who are interested in a

436
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,400
deeper dive into the india situation

437
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:13,440
there's a lot of material on our website

438
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,840
we have a whole dedicated section on

439
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,240
covet 19 so i'd invite you to

440
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:22,798
check us out there thank you andrew

441
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,160
great thank you so much prabhu and so

442
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,400
we'll be returning to

443
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,519
questions for prabhu's presentation at

444
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,559
the end

445
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,960
and i'll invite ed mobile to to upload

446
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,000
his

447
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,640
presentation yeah so

448
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,319
uh while that is uh being done i just

449
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,960
wanted to start with the qualify

450
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,759
and say that um a large part of what uh

451
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,400
problem

452
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,079
presented for india uh based on

453
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,160
similarity with what's happening

454
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,918
in africa as well so there will be some

455
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,519
a little bit of an overlap

456
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,520
the second qualifier being that

457
00:18:53,599 --> 00:19:00,879
the africa is a large continent

458
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,798
so i'm painting with very broad brush

459
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,080
you know what is 54 countries and i'll

460
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,879
speak much more to

461
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,558
sub-saharan africa so there won't be as

462
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,960
many numbers because you know this is

463
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:13,038
very generalized stylized effect of

464
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,480
new evidence that we were getting from

465
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,720
africa so

466
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,720
i want to make five key points in this

467
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,079
uh opening segment

468
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,880
and this is as follows the first point i

469
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,519
want to make is

470
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,520
we have kind of the africa situation in

471
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,400
terms of the pandemic itself

472
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,319
is still very much a mystery or at least

473
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,840
to me i've not had any

474
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,839
really convincing one narrative on why

475
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,319
africa has somewhat been spread to date

476
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,839
in terms of the epidemiology itself

477
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,759
there are many theories out there but

478
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,240
what i'm showing you right now

479
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,000
is the cumulative cases uh from john

480
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,558
hopkins uh

481
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,319
coronavares resource center so you can

482
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,519
see from this map

483
00:19:54,319 --> 00:20:00,000
the map of africa is very much lower

484
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,158
numbers in terms of cumulative cases

485
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,599
compared to look at the the u.s for

486
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,720
example in europe

487
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,678
so this is quite an anomaly uh you know

488
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,000
usually

489
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,280
on most maps africa is a red one and the

490
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,159
rest of the world is you know

491
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,440
usually the green the green side when

492
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,679
you look at the

493
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,880
incidence rate so this is divided by

494
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,360
population

495
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,080
you see that it's even even less the

496
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,879
case

497
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,720
so we still have this big anomaly that

498
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,200
many theories have been proposed

499
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,200
on why africa has not been affected this

500
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,798
much i'll mention a few of them here one

501
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,080
of them was

502
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,918
the bcg vaccine another one is the warm

503
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,319
climate in africa

504
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,080
uh another one is uh relatively youthful

505
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,759
population with africa having

506
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,798
more than three quarters of the

507
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,440
continent under the age of 35.

508
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,200
uh i would say collectively they might

509
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,240
start to explain something but

510
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,400
i don't think they are anywhere close to

511
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,359
explaining the anomalies even within

512
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,798
africa itself

513
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,199
so for example you have progress in

514
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,119
south africa in kenya

515
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,319
and some people have said justice lack

516
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,558
of measurement you know

517
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,319
like uh you know there's very little

518
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,839
testing in some of this but you'd also

519
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,319
think that hospitals would be starting

520
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:15,279
to fill up by now

521
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,279
another group that i've had you know in

522
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,879
starting to gain momentum now is

523
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,359
maybe people have not given enough

524
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,960
credit to key decisions that were made

525
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,240
by african leaders

526
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,519
uh that uh africa closed down borders in

527
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,960
much of this year and they already was

528
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,359
very little movement

529
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,319
so the diseased lord there was law from

530
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,079
the beginning

531
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,720
and maybe that's a lesson that we need

532
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:41,359
to be sharing with the rest of the world

533
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,079
i will not try to speculate on to which

534
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,000
of us

535
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,960
is correct but it suffices you to say

536
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,200
that in terms of disease lord itself

537
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,159
africa right now is a very very low

538
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
incidence

539
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,760
i hope that it continues this way but

540
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,240
this is what we know

541
00:21:53,759 --> 00:22:00,879
we know as of now so that said

542
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,319
the impact of the uh pandemic itself has

543
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,200
been much more indirect

544
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,519
through the uh agricultural sector so

545
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,919
i'll show two more slides and i'll speak

546
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,599
more freely on some of my talking points

547
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,080
that i have

548
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,918
one key uh you know you know a lot of

549
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,839
evidence is coming in now from different

550
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,559
sources but this is just very recent

551
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,759
this came out

552
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:23,759
last month in nature he's talking about

553
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,759
you know with this last point that i

554
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,879
made the closure of national boundaries

555
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,960
in africa came with a lot of disruption

556
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,799
in movement of people

557
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,558
and it looks like this is having a lot

558
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,558
of effects on the planting season for

559
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,678
most crops now in africa

560
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:42,558
so by every estimate the disruption in

561
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,240
step of food supply especially for maize

562
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,319
and rice

563
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,759
inputs usually come from urban areas go

564
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,399
to rural areas and

565
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,440
products move from rural areas quarter

566
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,600
urban areas

567
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,519
all that has been disrupted at local

568
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,079
level domestic level and the regional

569
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,918
level

570
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,599
and this is likely to have significant

571
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,679
effects if not now

572
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,599
in the next season on amount of food

573
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,679
that is available out there

574
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,599
this report goes on the show i mean this

575
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,720
just shows you the two main step-up

576
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,839
crops

577
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,159
of rice and maize and you can see there

578
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,599
the

579
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,919
uh the impact on the growing season

580
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,359
you know when covered heat in early

581
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,440
march and april

582
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,439
it was really a key part of the planting

583
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,000
season and that was disrupted

584
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,320
and this we're likely to see this effect

585
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,839
uh in a few months from now so this is

586
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,480
something that

587
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:35,279
you know i disrupted the production

588
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,440
system for most of the stepper crops

589
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,918
i happened to be the african development

590
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,759
bank when coveted 19 was declared a

591
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,080
global pandemic

592
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,200
and one of my last tasks at the african

593
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,199
development bank

594
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,000
i actually delivered this to the board

595
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,400
in june was to develop a strategy for

596
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,079
the feed africa response to covet 19

597
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,480
that was going to be implemented

598
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,278
across the continent the key

599
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,319
measurements

600
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,119
that we came up with to minimize

601
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,558
disruption of

602
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,519
our food food flow in africa were eight

603
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:07,038
key areas

604
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,639
i'll just go through them here because

605
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,240
they kind of capture the

606
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,679
the thinking around that time some of

607
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,679
which has changed

608
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,519
so we decided we were going to invest in

609
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,679
about eight key priority areas

610
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,558
the bank was putting up about 10 billion

611
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,480
dollars

612
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,759
to help african countries cope with this

613
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,599
pandemic

614
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,000
so we did uh supporting for food

615
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:28,480
delivery especially targeting the poor

616
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,079
and vulnerable populations

617
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,640
we also supported governments in

618
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,798
creating uh stabilization of food prices

619
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,640
either by releasing food from strategic

620
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,558
grain reserves

621
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,880
we supported efforts to increase

622
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,440
localized food production system we knew

623
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,960
that

624
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,200
and i'll get it into this in a little

625
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,200
bit that localized food product you know

626
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,720
it's more likely to be stable

627
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,038
and impact resilient compared to food

628
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,640
that was coming from abroad

629
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,519
we encouraged governments to invest a

630
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,278
lot in extension and advisory services

631
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,599
so that there was minimal disruption in

632
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,119
production tried as much as we could you

633
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,558
know there was still some significant

634
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,639
disruptions

635
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,399
post-harvesting agro-processing of

636
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,840
highly nutritious foods

637
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,840
so when you talk about fruits and

638
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,399
vegetables and meat highly perishable

639
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,399
goods

640
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,759
we realized we needed to invest a lot of

641
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,440
resources into

642
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:22,079
preserving the flow of those also policy

643
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,759
support for free flow of food and other

644
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,359
inputs we had to declare for most

645
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,839
countries that food was

646
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,439
essential service so we created green

647
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,599
channels through which

648
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,200
food could flow uh from country to

649
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,278
country in within countries

650
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,278
and spread from the many of the

651
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,200
quarantine measures that were in place

652
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,038
we established some food security task

653
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,558
forces that were regional level

654
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,798
and also supported several other

655
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,798
regional initiatives

656
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,918
i will stop sharing my screen now so i

657
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:52,079
can actually see and talk to the people

658
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,320
and i will make three more points about

659
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,158
what this pandemic did for food security

660
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,038
in africa

661
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,159
so important to note that the pandemic

662
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,440
came on top of

663
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,320
already existing uh food insecurity on

664
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,720
the continent

665
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,839
africa was already battling with upwards

666
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,519
of 74 million people who were food

667
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,079
insecure there was already a climate

668
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,519
shock you know a lot of climate change

669
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,199
there was conflict

670
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,798
we were dealing with the locust invasion

671
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,798
that had taken all all the horn of

672
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,119
africa we were dealing with foreign

673
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,960
so when this shock came it came on

674
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,918
pre-existing conditions that just made

675
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,200
things worse

676
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,520
and it may be hard to actually

677
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,720
disentangle these different effects from

678
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,038
covet 19

679
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,759
compared to what was already existing so

680
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,759
so that's something important to note

681
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,960
another point is that these actually

682
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,119
turns out to be

683
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,720
a zero-sum game when it comes to public

684
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,558
resources

685
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,159
uh this is something that hit us very

686
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:47,839
very quickly that you know

687
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,919
when you're talking about governments

688
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,079
even development community

689
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,400
they have a limited budget so what you

690
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,359
take from

691
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,400
what you put money into health into

692
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:59,678
education

693
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,640
you have to take that money from

694
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,759
somewhere uh

695
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,600
governments we're faced with this

696
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,278
critical decision we love agriculture

697
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,000
but this is a health crisis

698
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:11,038
so ministers of health had the biggest

699
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,960
you know voice

700
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,960
and most of the resources went to health

701
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,480
first and we really had to campaign hard

702
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,399
to say that

703
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,880
look this is more of a food crisis

704
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,398
pandemic for africa then it is a you

705
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,840
know a health crisis

706
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,000
and you really have to fight for those

707
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,519
resources across the different other

708
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,519
sectors as well so

709
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,759
there was a lot of this back and forth

710
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,158
depend on where governments were going

711
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,960
to allocate their money

712
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,880
lastly i want to speak more to which

713
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,720
groups have been most affected by this

714
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,159
in terms of africa the evidence is still

715
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,480
coming and you know i

716
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,000
want to underscore this point that we're

717
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,079
not just at the beginning of this

718
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,640
pandemic so any conclusions that we make

719
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,519
now are

720
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,720
likely to be premature but the evidence

721
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,278
that we're seeing so far

722
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,600
in the usa you know is that low income

723
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:00,640
households have been affected the most

724
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,000
almost by definition low income muscles

725
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,520
have been the most vulnerable

726
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,119
at the beginning of the pandemic there

727
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,158
was a rush to buy food

728
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,879
the most households to stock up and hold

729
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,440
up you know

730
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,960
much like what you did toilet paper it

731
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,558
was happening in africa shelves were

732
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,880
getting cleared up

733
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,879
but poor people who live from you know

734
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,480
and tend to mouth do not have that kind

735
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,840
of money so when the shelves were

736
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,839
initially emptied

737
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,240
prices went up and poor people did not

738
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,278
have money to buy and stock up in there

739
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,558
you know they don't even have

740
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:30,720
refrigerators

741
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,079
to keep their food in so you are seeing

742
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,200
a large part of the

743
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,038
affected population being the most poor

744
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,038
and vulnerable populations

745
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:43,119
within that subgroup you also have

746
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,720
women and children you know all the

747
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,359
evidence that we're seeing here is

748
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,038
being the most affected and i'll say

749
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,199
when you compare rural to urban

750
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,720
households

751
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,399
rural households at least at the

752
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,839
advantage that they'd localize food

753
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:56,959
production system so they're a little

754
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,038
bit more resilient

755
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,480
but the large part of africa's urban

756
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,879
population was

757
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,798
employed in the informal sector and once

758
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,120
they lost their flow of income

759
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,558
they did not have any requests to you

760
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,519
know income that they could use to

761
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:11,278
purchase food

762
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:12,960
and they did not have the capabilities

763
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,200
to grow their own food

764
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,960
so most of them either if they still had

765
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,278
connections to rural areas

766
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,640
they migrated back to their parents home

767
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,079
in the rural areas

768
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,159
increasing the pressure they are much

769
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,158
like prabhu mentioned for india as well

770
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,640
so you're seeing a large part of this

771
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,640
human movement from rural urban areas

772
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,480
and you're seeing the most vulnerable

773
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,000
groups bearing the brand of this

774
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,240
pandemic in terms of

775
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,240
food insecurity i'll leave it there for

776
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,278
now and we'll get back to other points

777
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,278
related to this thanks

778
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,359
excellent thank you so much ed and i'm

779
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:48,960
over to you rachel

780
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:52,319
um so uh thank you very much and it's

781
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,640
an honor to be presenting here and today

782
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:54,319
i'm

783
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,759
presenting on something that's quite

784
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:59,359
different from my usual

785
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:02,398
focus um uh because most of my

786
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:06,158
work is in is in malawi and

787
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:09,199
in southern africa but i have

788
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:12,720
had the the privilege of working

789
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,360
in new york as a volunteer around covet

790
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,038
19

791
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,199
and the food systems that's why i was

792
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:20,480
asked to present on new york

793
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,759
um and uh it we go from

794
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,240
a continent to a country and now to a

795
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:30,079
region of uh a state so

796
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,480
and and one that you all uh have uh

797
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,240
or many of you i don't want to make

798
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,480
assumptions about where you are now but

799
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,359
one all of many of you have experienced

800
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,960
directly so

801
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:44,000
it it's a real sweep today um

802
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,440
but i'm going to do a move from

803
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,440
food producer over to consumer and

804
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,640
looking at the food system

805
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,440
and uh just to say that my role in

806
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,880
in looking at new york um has been on

807
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,120
the tompkins county

808
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,360
uh covet 19 food task force which i uh

809
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:07,278
co-organized with rafa ponte

810
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:10,639
and uh the late uh kirby edmunds and um

811
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:13,359
and um uh cce

812
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,200
and and others um at the start of the

813
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:18,319
pandemic as a response to

814
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,759
trying to uh deal with the impacts on

815
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,798
the food system

816
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:25,599
so in in terms of food producers um

817
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,839
we know early on there was really

818
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:30,558
challenges in new york around

819
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,918
changes in markets as you had schools

820
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,398
closing as uh

821
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,960
restaurants uh shut down in the lockdown

822
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,239
that meant

823
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,278
a lot of uh markets that were normally

824
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,519
available

825
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:43,599
for producers were gone and we saw this

826
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,880
particularly with the dairy industry

827
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,319
with losing their

828
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,799
market in in schools and restaurants

829
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,720
they actually had to dump a significant

830
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,720
amount of their milk at the beginning of

831
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,640
the pandemic and that got a lot of

832
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,240
attention nationally and even

833
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,480
internationally

834
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,240
but there were other significant impacts

835
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,278
on producers and it really varied by

836
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,240
sector but

837
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,798
a recent survey that the new york state

838
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,200
government

839
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,480
um did found 65 percent of new york

840
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,200
farms were affected

841
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,759
negatively by the pandemic everything

842
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,278
from

843
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,879
labor shortages and this was

844
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,519
particularly an issue

845
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,640
for the fruit and vegetable industry

846
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,399
when you had

847
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,759
restrictions on migration and

848
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,719
movement into the country and within

849
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:30,798
states it

850
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,960
led to both shortages and uncertainty

851
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:36,558
about labor uh supply

852
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,919
and then this real shift in uh demand

853
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:42,240
and market opportunities so both

854
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,399
soaring demand in some areas for example

855
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,759
in local meat there was a really

856
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:51,278
a steep increase in in local demand for

857
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:54,480
or demand for local meat and um

858
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,880
reduced uh demand in for example uh

859
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,399
restaurants and other other institutions

860
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,919
that used to be

861
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:04,000
available so some local

862
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,120
fruit and vegetable producers who had a

863
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
range of

864
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,639
options who had a range of markets

865
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,679
normally

866
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,679
they were able to adjust but others who

867
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,640
depended on some of these institutional

868
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,640
sources really

869
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,399
struggled and and so there's a lot of

870
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,440
variation in the impact and how it was

871
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:22,719
felt

872
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,519
but often a need to pivot in the way

873
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,000
that

874
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,079
uh their product was sold and and

875
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,919
sometimes that meant learning new skills

876
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:31,359
learning how to market things online

877
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,559
learning how to work through new

878
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,439
distributors

879
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,000
and and so real steep learning curve and

880
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,120
for

881
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
those who are planting uh crop

882
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,359
based producers often at a time when

883
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,519
they were having to plan

884
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,558
at the beginning of the season what to

885
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,200
plant so real

886
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,158
really high stress circumstance for

887
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,519
farmers

888
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,080
for producers across the state and

889
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,038
um this wasn't only felt for producers

890
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:00,319
it was really

891
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,720
felt for farm workers and farm workers

892
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,720
were

893
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,240
particularly vulnerable to the impacts

894
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,480
of coven 19

895
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,440
in part because of their own often

896
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,878
precarious

897
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,440
uh employment conditions they initially

898
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:14,960
lacked

899
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,358
information about ppe and cova 19

900
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,000
and the cornell farm worker program

901
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,559
which is

902
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,159
here at cornell has has been really

903
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,519
essential in providing some

904
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,358
critical information to farm workers um

905
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,199
and really trying to to connect with

906
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,078
them as there was a lot of

907
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,279
confusion and uncertainty but also their

908
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,720
own living conditions

909
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,720
made it difficult if there was a case

910
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,878
it often spread quickly and there was

911
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,480
some high-profile cases

912
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,559
at the beginning of the pandemic that

913
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,000
drew attention to this issue

914
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:51,279
hard to isolate and um

915
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,519
hard to prevent spread and then

916
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,440
because of their own employment

917
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,480
conditions sometimes a lack of access to

918
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,079
health care

919
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,480
and testing um which um a number of

920
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,320
organizations working with farm workers

921
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,199
like the farmworker program here

922
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,880
here in ithaca uh really tried to and in

923
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,919
the surrounding region really trying to

924
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,640
alleviate but an ongoing challenge uh

925
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,119
for for that particular uh sector within

926
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,279
our

927
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,800
within our uh community that is not

928
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,359
always visible to us even though they're

929
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,800
a crucial part of the food system

930
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,119
um thinking about food retail uh there

931
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,280
was

932
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:32,240
a real shift and we all felt it you know

933
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,640
ed talked about you know the the rush on

934
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,319
on

935
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:38,159
uh food and uh different uh supplies and

936
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,838
we certainly saw that in our own grocery

937
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:43,279
stores here in new york state

938
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:45,838
at the same time we saw a real loss of

939
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,519
jobs for many people working in the food

940
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:50,719
service industry

941
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:54,320
and a shift towards online delivery

942
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:57,919
and online orders

943
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,480
and a lot of small food retail

944
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,680
businesses restaurants and food

945
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:07,920
businesses closing um

946
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:11,279
so this all made for um

947
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,200
impacts on the consumer end but uh

948
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,480
inconsistent supplies in grocery

949
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:18,000
retailers and

950
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:21,280
supply chain disruptions and um

951
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,199
this so that was on the retail side but

952
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,560
then on the consumption side we have

953
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,919
sort of contrasting stories on the one

954
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,039
hand

955
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,680
there was this surge in interest in

956
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,880
joining community supported agriculture

957
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,199
in

958
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,680
buying local buying from local farmers

959
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:42,399
markets buying from local farms

960
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,519
in interest in home gardening and

961
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,599
canning there's been

962
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,480
shortages of canning supplies in the

963
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,760
grocery stores because of this interest

964
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,320
and a lot of kind of relearning home

965
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,160
food preparation so this is a happy

966
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,440
story for some

967
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:01,519
um but in contrast you have

968
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,200
rising disparities in access to healthy

969
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,280
food and a recent paper out of the

970
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,000
university of buffalo really highlighted

971
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,920
this

972
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,760
this uh disparity so uh

973
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,358
ordering food online is often more

974
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,280
expensive if you're

975
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,039
sick at home and you need to have food

976
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,640
delivered to your home that could

977
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:24,480
mean you can't access it easily snap

978
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,118
the um supplemental nutrition program

979
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,199
here in

980
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,039
the united states isn't always available

981
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,439
for online retail

982
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,199
and people had there was a rise in

983
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,039
unemployment so people had less money

984
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,679
available for purchasing food

985
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,279
there is shorter shopping hours that may

986
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,759
not be accessible for people who are

987
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,920
working several part-time jobs

988
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,960
and less food available when you get to

989
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,880
the grocery store

990
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,559
at times because of this supply chain

991
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,800
disruption and that was particularly in

992
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:54,559
the early period of the pandemic

993
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:58,079
as well as school food

994
00:37:54,559 --> 00:38:00,320
disruptions now some school

995
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,800
programs were able to do home delivery

996
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,599
and in tompkins county we were

997
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,400
lucky that the school system really

998
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,519
shifted

999
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,880
and delivered food to kids

1000
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:15,519
in at home throughout the early

1001
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,240
lockdown period but all of this put

1002
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,838
together

1003
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:23,118
led to dramatic surge in food insecurity

1004
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:24,719
in the united states and in new york uh

1005
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,920
in particular

1006
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:31,199
so this is

1007
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,760
from feeding america but

1008
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,239
there's a recent report um put together

1009
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,280
by

1010
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:40,319
um cornell cce and

1011
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,359
um which also documents this

1012
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,480
rise in food insecurity nationally um

1013
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:48,000
from 11

1014
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:51,119
to 23 and an estimated uh

1015
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,000
in tompkins county uh an increase from

1016
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:58,720
10.3 percent to 13 uh 13.6 percent

1017
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,559
um these are preliminary numbers and i

1018
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,799
know there's a lot of effort to try to

1019
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,599
document it

1020
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,240
at a national scale but nonetheless it's

1021
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,200
been

1022
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,679
well uh documented there is a dramatic

1023
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,439
surge

1024
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:13,598
in food insecurity and it's being felt

1025
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,119
more acutely by particular groups of

1026
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,400
households

1027
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,160
so 38 of black households in

1028
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,079
the united states are estimated to be

1029
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:25,440
food insecure for example

1030
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,240
um and and alongside this

1031
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,358
is real challenges with emergency food

1032
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:32,399
provision

1033
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:35,920
in new york and and at a national scale

1034
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,920
so we saw for the first few months of

1035
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,400
the pandemic this dramatic

1036
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,559
increase in the number of people looking

1037
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,519
for

1038
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:46,480
free food because they had lost their

1039
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:48,880
job and they

1040
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,000
they were facing you know serious

1041
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,280
shortages

1042
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,880
and they had many had never had to

1043
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,560
access emergency food

1044
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,640
prior to this pandemic and

1045
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:01,838
there was a dramatic increase in the

1046
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,639
amount of food

1047
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:06,159
distributed through food banks which and

1048
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:09,440
we saw this in some of the

1049
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:12,639
early headlines in

1050
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,400
the spring and the summer with long

1051
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:18,400
lineups and waiting for

1052
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:22,079
uh food distribution and combined with

1053
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:25,440
the impacts in the retail food industry

1054
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,359
there is a 70 decline in retail food

1055
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,760
donations an estimated 70

1056
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,719
decline and they are one of the major

1057
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,599
two food banks

1058
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,199
and and retail food groceries are some

1059
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,240
of the major suppliers

1060
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:40,399
of food to food banks and so this meant

1061
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,318
that some food banks had to reduce the

1062
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,880
amount provided to households so you

1063
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:45,358
have

1064
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,200
increase in demand and a decrease in

1065
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,318
supply at the same time

1066
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,559
and you also saw a reduction in

1067
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:55,838
volunteers and staff shortages

1068
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:59,119
in a number of food pantries

1069
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:00,400
because many uh sort of older seniors

1070
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,960
are those who staff

1071
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,119
and volunteer at food pantries the real

1072
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,159
challenge within the emergency

1073
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,720
uh food world um particularly

1074
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,078
rural food pantries uh preliminary

1075
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,759
reports suggest that they've had

1076
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,318
particular difficulties with

1077
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,800
lineups and following uh you know

1078
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:20,719
dealing

1079
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,160
dealing with increased demand and a

1080
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,399
addressing the kind of health

1081
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,239
requirements and health guidelines

1082
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,960
many of the places where food is

1083
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:30,399
distributed are small spaces so a lot of

1084
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,639
places had to

1085
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,519
readjust and and find new ways of

1086
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:39,118
delivering food in in this context

1087
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:41,759
and alongside this you know sort of deep

1088
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,400
challenges to the food system

1089
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,160
we saw in new york and and in tompkins

1090
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,240
county is no exception

1091
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:53,279
uh a proliferation of real um

1092
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:56,078
creative responses and a an

1093
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,200
effort to address these needs in in our

1094
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,039
communities

1095
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:00,879
and many of you may have seen for

1096
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:04,480
example these mutual

1097
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,920
aid food boxes that were developed

1098
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:11,280
and placed around the county

1099
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,720
where people would put food and

1100
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,200
other people who needed it would just

1101
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:18,399
come and get it it was an informal

1102
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:20,559
system that was developed and kind of a

1103
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,639
rose out of out of need and interest in

1104
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:26,078
helping each other

1105
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:27,039
as i mentioned uh i along with a lot of

1106
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,280
other players

1107
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:32,559
put together this coven 19 food task

1108
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,440
force

1109
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:36,799
which included county government city

1110
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,119
government

1111
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,119
the southern tier

1112
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,519
food bank the food bank of the southern

1113
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,960
tier uh the

1114
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:51,679
cce um cornell farm workers program

1115
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,960
a whole range of different players came

1116
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:54,879
together

1117
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,000
working across the food system to talk

1118
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,599
about what

1119
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,039
challenges were being faced and how to

1120
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,440
address them uh

1121
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,199
together one of the initiatives that

1122
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,240
came there was an initiative at the

1123
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,399
state level

1124
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,559
um called nourish new york but there was

1125
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,920
a local initiative nourished tompkins

1126
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,400
which was

1127
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,159
getting local food from local food

1128
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,720
producers and distributing it to a

1129
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,719
number of different programs

1130
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,559
to that were trying to make sure

1131
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,559
low-income households had

1132
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:23,838
access to healthy food during the

1133
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,000
pandemic

1134
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,599
the cornell farm workers program

1135
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,519
developed a list of

1136
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,800
i think it was over a thousand farm

1137
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,559
workers their

1138
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,400
cell phone numbers to be able to text

1139
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,159
them information and keep them up to

1140
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,160
date and there was a

1141
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,000
group of volunteers who made homemade

1142
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:40,799
masks and delivered it to them and there

1143
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,679
has been

1144
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,079
a real effort at delivering local food

1145
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:46,480
to

1146
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,640
and meals to farm workers who are in

1147
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,199
isolation because of copenhagen so these

1148
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:51,440
are

1149
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:54,239
some examples of some really creative

1150
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,800
strategies for addressing these uh

1151
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,959
challenges during the pandemic and it

1152
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,960
was really a combination of

1153
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,039
you know non-profits local food

1154
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,240
distributors some local companies

1155
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:09,279
um this is an example from

1156
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:12,318
a solidarity garden that was

1157
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,440
planted uh with local farmers

1158
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:17,838
and uh local non-profits uh

1159
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,480
to make sure that people had access to

1160
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:21,679
food

1161
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,159
and so some inspiring stories as well

1162
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:24,480
and

1163
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,759
i think i'm well under my time i'm

1164
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,800
looking at andy

1165
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,440
so uh just to some initial conclusions

1166
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,039
and as

1167
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,599
ed and probably noted this is uh kind of

1168
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,960
early days for having strong conclusions

1169
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,240
about what's been happening

1170
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,960
um in new york but these

1171
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,279
initial food supply chain disruptions

1172
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,440
and

1173
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,119
you know concerns about high high amount

1174
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,480
of waste because of the

1175
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,720
shifts in markets those were kind of the

1176
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,280
initial experiences of the pandemic but

1177
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,480
then

1178
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,160
there was a a successful

1179
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,079
transitioning to new markets and

1180
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:01,838
delivery systems i would say amongst

1181
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,160
many producers

1182
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:05,920
but serious challenges for small and

1183
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,759
mid-sized producers and small and

1184
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,519
mid-sized food retailers in this

1185
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,079
environment

1186
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,838
and i highlighted the kind of particular

1187
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,720
vulnerability of farm workers

1188
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:18,719
both in terms of health impacts and food

1189
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,719
security impacts

1190
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,078
during the pandemic and rising

1191
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:24,159
disparities

1192
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,640
rising rates of food insecurity and

1193
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,078
rising disparities in terms of access to

1194
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,960
healthy food

1195
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,760
and so all of this points to a need to

1196
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,760
coordinate

1197
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,000
and communicate better across local and

1198
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,480
regional food systems and strengthening

1199
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,079
local and regional food systems much as

1200
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,440
ed mentioned as a priority in the

1201
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,560
african context

1202
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,039
a need to ensure that we have a vibrant

1203
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:50,960
local and regional food system to be

1204
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,960
able to respond to these kinds of shocks

1205
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:58,159
the the um pandemic also highlighted the

1206
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,559
the really inspiring kind of

1207
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,078
willingness of people to step outside of

1208
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,519
their normal roles

1209
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,640
and take on new ones and collaborate and

1210
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:08,800
communicate across

1211
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,679
sectors in in ways that were really

1212
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,400
inspiring

1213
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:14,879
at the same time as highlighting the

1214
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,519
kind of fragility of

1215
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,400
low-income households to shocks and

1216
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:20,639
their

1217
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,480
their the sort of lack of social safety

1218
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:25,440
nets that really support

1219
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,000
households during these kinds of shocks

1220
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,318
to ensure that they are food secure and

1221
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,679
are getting access to nutritious food so

1222
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:34,480
this is a challenge

1223
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,679
not only in india and in africa but also

1224
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,800
here in new york state

1225
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:42,000
with people of color

1226
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,400
color and low income households really

1227
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,318
suffering dramatically from food

1228
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,160
insecurity and lack of access to

1229
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,960
nutritious food

1230
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:53,920
and even even though there is adequate

1231
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,519
supply still within the food system so

1232
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,440
i think those would be some of the key

1233
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:00,880
take-home messages that i would

1234
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,318
that i would um emphasize um i guess one

1235
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,760
other point in terms of

1236
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:09,119
small and mid-sized producers the um

1237
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,520
the nourish new york program initially

1238
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,640
really supported large-scale producers

1239
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:16,159
and and

1240
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,159
uh the coven 19 tompkins county kova 19

1241
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,318
food task force um

1242
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,920
really had a chance to discuss this with

1243
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:25,199
the new york state

1244
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,480
um organizers of that program and

1245
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:30,960
in the hopes that the future program

1246
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,920
if there's further efforts along these

1247
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,519
lines that there's an

1248
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,599
effort to try to support small and

1249
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:37,358
mid-skies producers in these kinds of

1250
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,318
programs and not just

1251
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,598
focus on the food supply angle of that

1252
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:44,000
program so

1253
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,599
um that's another kind of take-home

1254
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,280
message to keep an eye on small and

1255
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,720
mid-sized producers as well

1256
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:54,559
in in these kind of government programs

1257
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:56,879
for ensuring access to healthy food

1258
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,000
so with that i'm going to stop sharing

1259
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,920
my screen

1260
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,920
and um thanks thanks a lot rachel

1261
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,039
we're almost at the end of our time so

1262
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,480
i'm going to ask

1263
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:10,880
one simple question and then if people

1264
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,639
uh have the appetite to stay on for a

1265
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,318
bit we'll we'll keep the session open

1266
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:17,039
for 10 15 minutes so people

1267
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:17,519
from the floor can ask questions but

1268
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:19,519
this is

1269
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,679
this has been an enormous stress test of

1270
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:24,639
course for the agri-food systems

1271
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,759
globally and probably some systemic

1272
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:27,519
weaknesses have been

1273
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,200
identified as well as areas of

1274
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:31,599
unexpected strength

1275
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,480
but for us as a research for development

1276
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,280
community

1277
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,199
i'm curious if if you all have uh some

1278
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,960
insights on how we should be doing our

1279
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:40,719
jobs differently has anything come up

1280
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,880
that suggests that we need

1281
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,239
new areas of research new forms of

1282
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,920
research collaboration

1283
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:48,719
or any other effort that really is

1284
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,318
responsive

1285
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,799
towards the resilience challenge that's

1286
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:55,199
been illuminated by the covet 19

1287
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,200
challenge

1288
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:06,318
that's all three of you

1289
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,519
turn taking is welcome i mean one of the

1290
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:10,079
things we struggled with

1291
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:11,119
in the task force was being able to

1292
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,200
identify

1293
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,318
who is vulnerable who is struggling with

1294
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:17,519
food insecurity

1295
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:18,318
um and how how to go about identifying

1296
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,119
them um

1297
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,400
i i saw that norman portillo was on the

1298
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,400
call earlier and he was

1299
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,680
he's been involved in this uh trying to

1300
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,880
do a survey

1301
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:31,519
locally and and so that you know being

1302
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,559
able to quickly identify who's food

1303
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:34,639
insecure

1304
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,599
and and how to reach them is is a

1305
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:40,639
challenge um

1306
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:40,640
even even in a country like the united

1307
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:46,558
states

1308
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,480
i wasn't just talking um i'll make two

1309
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,119
uh three very quick points here

1310
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,400
the first one is that in africa

1311
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,800
especially

1312
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,960
the lack of real-time intelligence on

1313
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,000
how much food is available

1314
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,559
with was just shocking to me we

1315
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,480
rely on we in research all of us you

1316
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,920
know we're happy with fao starts from

1317
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,400
2018

1318
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,800
when this pandemic hits ministers of

1319
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,318
agriculture struggling to find out

1320
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:17,039
exactly how much price is in nigeria

1321
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,960
much that this information is in the

1322
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:21,358
hands of private companies

1323
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,480
most of them are very small so we just

1324
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:24,318
did not know

1325
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,679
how much food is out there so it's very

1326
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:27,440
hard to act

1327
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,519
and develop policy and measures when you

1328
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,000
have very little intelligence on what

1329
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:34,480
the actual situation looks like

1330
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
secondly you know i'll say for africa

1331
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,039
where the food systems are highly

1332
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,760
informal

1333
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,599
we underestimated how much movement of

1334
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,440
food is related to movement

1335
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:47,280
of people uh a lot of food in africa

1336
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,079
does not move on these 40-foot

1337
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,240
containers

1338
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:54,960
it caused by people making it to to

1339
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:57,039
see my cousin in town i'm gonna take

1340
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,838
this much food with me and if i'm going

1341
00:50:57,039 --> 00:50:59,759
from

1342
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,000
urban to raw areas i'm gonna move with

1343
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,559
food the moment you cut the movement of

1344
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,280
food

1345
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,640
of people inevitably you're gonna have a

1346
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,960
significant impact

1347
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,879
on the movement of food so as much as

1348
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,720
you try to disentangle the two

1349
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,559
they're very much intertwined especially

1350
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:16,799
in developing countries

1351
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,119
then the third lesson which requires a

1352
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,119
little bit more research is that really

1353
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,440
this look what this is the first would

1354
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,680
say global pandemic that has happened

1355
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,079
when the world was globalized

1356
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:29,039
so occasionally with sharks in one part

1357
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,280
of the world and more

1358
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,719
food could move from one part into

1359
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,880
another part

1360
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:35,919
this is really making us relook at this

1361
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,480
these

1362
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,800
resilience of localized food systems

1363
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,199
that people had started to ignore in a

1364
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,920
way

1365
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:46,480
we always knew our rice would somehow

1366
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,559
get grown in canada and end up with some

1367
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,400
people would have bred in zimbabwe and

1368
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,519
we didn't pay attention to what happens

1369
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,760
in between

1370
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:55,280
for the first time people who were just

1371
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,720
shocked that you know

1372
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,319
this everybody was looking after

1373
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:01,279
themselves in the first

1374
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,800
three months all these countries were

1375
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,359
panicking they said we're gonna take

1376
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,280
care for

1377
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:07,119
southwest before we start exporting

1378
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,240
russia you know all these

1379
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:12,079
big countries so it really made this uh

1380
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:14,000
local politics and local governments

1381
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,680
focus on local production and

1382
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,079
almost a movement back to

1383
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:20,239
self-sufficiency which has this downside

1384
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,920
as well but it really highlighted the

1385
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:26,318
importance of localized

1386
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,318
food system in a pandemic like this one

1387
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,559
so one thing that strikes me is um

1388
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,400
you know as people working in food and

1389
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:42,000
agriculture

1390
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:45,680
we don't really think too much about

1391
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,480
the rural urban integration not in terms

1392
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:48,318
of food

1393
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,679
supply chains which you think about a

1394
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:52,639
lot but

1395
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:53,358
thinking about how rural households

1396
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:55,920
depend on

1397
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:58,838
income coming from urban house urban

1398
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,680
housings back to rural households and

1399
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:04,960
remittances and and how

1400
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:07,358
crucial that income is for

1401
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,920
survival of rural households and food

1402
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:13,199
security of rural households

1403
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:16,079
i think that connection is often missed

1404
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,358
and this crisis showed very clearly that

1405
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,318
once you

1406
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:23,199
cut that connection off rural food

1407
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:25,558
insecurity goes through the roof

1408
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,118
and people think about rural areas as

1409
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:30,240
self-generating

1410
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:32,400
food self-sufficient areas but the rural

1411
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,479
markets depend a lot on remittances

1412
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,519
coming from urban areas

1413
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,519
and i think what one of the lessons

1414
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,639
that comes out clearly is we need to

1415
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:43,920
think about

1416
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:46,078
employment security in a much bigger way

1417
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,720
than we do right now

1418
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,760
so if if a third of the employment

1419
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:54,000
opportunities

1420
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:57,040
in india are casual employment

1421
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,318
without contracts and high risk

1422
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:02,880
of termination at any point then that's

1423
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:04,318
not a sustainable way to manage labor

1424
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,680
markets

1425
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:09,519
and we need to think about long-term

1426
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:11,118
solutions for labor markets and even

1427
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:13,318
think about

1428
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,720
more regional more local

1429
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:17,358
non-agricultural

1430
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:19,838
employment opportunities which can then

1431
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:20,880
substitute for these remittance flows

1432
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:24,960
that

1433
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:27,280
that have become so crucial for survival

1434
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,679
the other point i want to make is this

1435
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,359
crisis has shown quite clearly that

1436
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:35,598
hunger is no longer an issue of calories

1437
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:36,880
there's more than enough calories to go

1438
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:39,480
around

1439
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,838
and we don't we shouldn't stick to this

1440
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:45,838
1960s paradigm which i'm

1441
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:46,798
sorry agriculture scientists still stick

1442
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:48,960
to which is

1443
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:51,440
we don't have enough pile of grain well

1444
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,559
we have more than enough piles of grain

1445
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,119
what we don't have is a balanced food

1446
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,640
system

1447
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,519
that provides for an adequate diversity

1448
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,318
of diets

1449
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:05,039
and i think that's an area where we

1450
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:08,480
should be thinking about a lot more

1451
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:10,719
let me stop there excellent

1452
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,679
thank you prabhu rachel and ed let me

1453
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:16,639
open the floor

1454
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:16,639
um chime in anybody who has a question

1455
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:22,719
hi everyone you can oh i'm sorry oh good

1456
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:25,358
good can you hear me okay i'm gonna

1457
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,639
step away from here for a second so i

1458
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:29,679
can take my mask off

1459
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:31,199
and you all can hear me better um

1460
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:33,358
my phone's going to die soon so i'm

1461
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:36,798
going to ask this fairly quickly but

1462
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:37,440
as there's so much hubbub about vaccines

1463
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:41,039
coming out

1464
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:43,679
soon and as that becomes apparent

1465
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,639
and and it hits the market depending on

1466
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:46,798
price

1467
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:48,798
um if there are poor countries that need

1468
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:51,759
to get their hands on the vaccine

1469
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:53,679
do you foresee these people these

1470
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,680
decision makers

1471
00:55:53,679 --> 00:56:00,719
may be prioritizing the vaccine

1472
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:03,118
over food security or is there

1473
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:05,358
limitations with receiving the vaccine

1474
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:09,039
that may affect food security

1475
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:09,039
coming up here in the next year

1476
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,280
it's a very good question i don't know

1477
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,639
if i don't if i have a good answer to

1478
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,559
that i mean first of all

1479
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,480
yes like the question the point that i

1480
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,519
raised is that when you're talking from

1481
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,000
a public

1482
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:29,838
expenditure point of view there's a very

1483
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,039
much a zero-sum game that people don't

1484
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:33,838
like to admit

1485
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,239
so money that goes the finite resources

1486
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:36,639
so

1487
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:37,838
the more you put money into one area

1488
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:39,679
such as health

1489
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:41,119
that money has to come from somewhere in

1490
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,318
developing countries

1491
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,240
is usually education health

1492
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,880
and agriculture are some of the biggest

1493
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,879
areas of expenditure so inevitably

1494
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,400
there's likely to be implications that

1495
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,798
if you put more money in health

1496
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,680
you might be investing less in education

1497
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:57,599
in uh

1498
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:59,759
and in agriculture as well but i'm

1499
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,359
hoping that there's gonna be a public

1500
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,000
public effort to make sure that we

1501
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:05,679
minimize uh that risk which

1502
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,280
i'm glad you're pointing out but i'm not

1503
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:08,960
sure how this is gonna play out it

1504
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,280
depends what kind of vaccine they have

1505
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,318
and it depends uh what kind of country

1506
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,319
priorities look like

1507
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,160
i don't know if probably

1508
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,240
well my my response is quite simple the

1509
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,240
share of

1510
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:31,279
agriculture and the total budgets of

1511
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:34,318
most countries is so tiny now

1512
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,960
and compared to the share of the budget

1513
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:39,440
for health

1514
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:42,960
and other infrastructure so it can't get

1515
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,960
worse than it is already

1516
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,118
so we are already at the bottom in terms

1517
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:49,118
of prices

1518
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,838
other questions from the floor

1519
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:05,598
i have one more um

1520
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:06,558
probably you've talked a lot about

1521
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,119
remittances

1522
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,880
and labor markets and of course this is

1523
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,480
also relevant to

1524
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,480
all the other dimensions the global

1525
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,240
discussion um but

1526
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,318
maybe let me ask you how much of this do

1527
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:21,598
you think is

1528
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:24,639
permanent change or not permanent but uh

1529
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:28,079
a new normal a new stable state

1530
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:29,920
where where um urban jobs are

1531
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,119
are deprioritized and people are back in

1532
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,798
the countryside

1533
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,960
or is this just something that we limp

1534
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:36,880
through and there will be

1535
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,079
you know we will revert back to what

1536
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,640
things are like

1537
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,720
before the pandemic how much of this do

1538
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:45,118
we adapt to or how much of it do we just

1539
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:47,519
endure

1540
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,720
so i see some of the students from my

1541
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:51,759
food policy class

1542
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:53,759
here and what i talk about there is

1543
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,000
the whole structural transformation that

1544
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,160
we've seen historically with populations

1545
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,798
moving from rural to urban areas and

1546
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:02,719
that's the normal right that's how

1547
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:04,400
most developed countries have gone and

1548
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:05,919
that's where developing countries have

1549
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,639
been going

1550
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,240
um this crisis really raises the

1551
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:11,279
question of whether we can do that

1552
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:14,159
differently

1553
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,119
and there is potential this i was just

1554
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:18,480
having

1555
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:21,920
a chat conversation here with david

1556
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:24,880
and the idea of building

1557
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,240
agri processing industry rural

1558
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,280
enterprises

1559
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:33,439
etc as new opportunities

1560
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:36,559
for employing rural populations and

1561
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,318
reducing the migrant flow is a way to

1562
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,440
think about it and i think it can be

1563
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:43,440
done

1564
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:46,960
um in a more novel way with

1565
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:50,000
smartphone technologies with icts

1566
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:53,119
and social networks and

1567
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,519
and other systems coming in now that

1568
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,599
you can create much more exciting

1569
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:00,719
employment opportunities

1570
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:02,079
for rural youth today than you could in

1571
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:06,078
the past

1572
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:07,599
so i definitely think policy community

1573
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,519
should be thinking about this more

1574
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:12,559
seriously

1575
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:15,920
can i head to that point there

1576
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:18,640
i think if you're planning this world

1577
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,838
indeed you'll have a reshift to focus in

1578
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:21,679
rural areas and

1579
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:23,759
rural production more young people going

1580
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:24,399
out there but it's much more to it that

1581
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,520
is

1582
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,200
more maybe cultural and psychological

1583
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,759
because if you look at you know in

1584
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:34,960
africa how many of those people in urban

1585
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,960
areas had jobs even before covered right

1586
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,639
the easiest of course we've known that's

1587
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,400
the law of

1588
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:42,480
and happened they have gone to zimbabwe

1589
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,119
last month and a lot of my cousins have

1590
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,039
moved from

1591
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,480
rural urban areas they've gone back to

1592
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:49,039
rural areas now but

1593
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,119
they're still saying is the moment this

1594
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:52,960
is over we're all gonna kind of go back

1595
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,480
and we all have this you know even here

1596
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,400
in this part of the world that

1597
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,838
as soon as this is over we're gonna go

1598
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,838
back to the normal

1599
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:00,960
so there is a little bit of a stickiness

1600
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:03,119
to that

1601
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,000
lifestyle that would require some

1602
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,880
significant

1603
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,920
re-education and change for people to

1604
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,000
realign and

1605
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,960
realize that the new normal is not going

1606
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,358
back to

1607
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,400
where you were before but we really have

1608
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:16,798
this

1609
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,119
mindset that you know anchors us to

1610
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:21,920
opportunities whether they exist or not

1611
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,960
in urban areas there's a poor then a law

1612
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,639
that's gonna

1613
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,960
require quite some education of

1614
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:29,039
especially young people to realize

1615
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,119
opportunities could be located somewhere

1616
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:32,639
else but if you could fix it that way i

1617
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,760
think this will be a long for long-term

1618
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:35,679
benefit of

1619
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,359
both develop food security and

1620
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:39,039
development overall that

1621
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:41,759
we can create opportunities in rural

1622
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:41,759
areas as well

1623
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:52,400
thank you ed rachel do you want to add

1624
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:55,838
to that

1625
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:58,559
i think i i agree that i think

1626
01:01:55,838 --> 01:02:00,239
part of the solution is trying to trying

1627
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:03,359
to support

1628
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,000
rural areas um there's been a real issue

1629
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:05,679
here

1630
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,838
in new york state with slaughterhouses

1631
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:10,239
for example for local livestock

1632
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:12,480
producers having access to adequate

1633
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:13,279
uh places even though there's a rise in

1634
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,719
demand they

1635
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,880
there hasn't been adequate

1636
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:19,519
slaughterhouse facilities for

1637
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:21,920
local producers to to meet that demand

1638
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:25,038
and that's part of a bigger picture

1639
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,480
which is really policies and programs

1640
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:29,119
which have really supported

1641
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,000
large-scale producers and large

1642
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,559
companies

1643
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
at the expense of small-scale and

1644
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,599
mid-sized producers

1645
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,079
and you've really seen that in the

1646
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:40,318
united states and that has hollowed out

1647
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,760
uh rural economies um because fewer

1648
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:42,798
people are living in rural places

1649
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,960
there's fewer

1650
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:46,719
businesses to support fewer producers

1651
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,920
and and it's been devastating

1652
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:52,719
in general for rural america and

1653
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,119
and this uh pandemic has highlighted

1654
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,318
that

1655
01:02:53,119 --> 01:03:00,240
more so i i would agree that supporting

1656
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:02,400
um local and regional food producers and

1657
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:04,959
distributors and

1658
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,760
food-related businesses and making these

1659
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,798
connections

1660
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,760
between local consumers getting access

1661
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,798
to healthy

1662
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:15,359
diverse food sources um and and

1663
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:16,639
supporting a regional economy is is a

1664
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:19,679
very important

1665
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:22,879
um learning that we should push for

1666
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:24,078
um but it will require a shift in the

1667
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,480
direction of

1668
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:31,839
federal and state policy in general

1669
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:34,079
which has gone in the opposite direction

1670
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:35,519
thank you thank you rachel so we're 15

1671
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,839
minutes over now

1672
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,440
uh we can probably entertain one more

1673
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:40,078
burning question if there is one from

1674
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,838
the floor

1675
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:45,839
anyone like to ask a final closing

1676
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:48,480
question

1677
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:50,000
all right uh with with that uh are there

1678
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,559

on behalf of

1683

1691
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:22,240
this culvert pandemic is a new

1692
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,880
class of uh natural disasters that you

1693
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:24,318
know

1694
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,160
best similarities with things that we've

1695
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:27,519
had in the past but it's got some unique

1696
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:29,838
aspects to it

1697
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:31,679
the jury is still far from out so the

1698
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:33,199
stories that we're writing today will

1699
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:34,798
have to be rewritten

1700
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:37,358
three or four times before we can

1701
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,159
actually fully do a postmortem on this

1702
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:40,318
so

1703
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:42,558
i'm just aging that these are emerging

1704
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:43,038
lessons and they're far from long-term

1705
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:45,599
lessons

1706
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,680
even though we're very quick to want to

1707
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,240
make key conclusions out of this

1708
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:50,960
i think we more of the effects will be

1709
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:52,959
written

1710
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,880
five years from now more volumes will be

1711
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,960
written about this and what he did

1712
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,599
to shape the nature of food security

1713
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,599
around the world

1714
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:05,199
i think what strikes me is some of the

1715
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,880
food security and vulnerability

1716
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:08,879
challenges

1717
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,280
that we see in the developing world we

1718
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,240
also see right here in new york state

1719
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:16,079
and

1720
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:19,199
and you know our communities are so

1721
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:22,798
disattached that we work on

1722
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:25,358
india or africa or the us but

1723
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:26,960
cross learning is so limited between

1724
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:28,558
what's happening in the u.s and what's

1725
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,318
happening in the developing world then

1726
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:36,000
it will be really interesting to build

1727
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:38,318
those bridges

1728
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,679
yes i i would agree probably i think

1729
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:42,318
that we could learn a lot from

1730
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:42,879
listening to each other's experiences um

1731
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:44,639
but uh

1732
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,798
