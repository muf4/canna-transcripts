1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:33,159
University well we bought a a drone for

3
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:35,439
our field research program this year uh

4
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:38,878
it's it's been very helpful for us to be

5
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,640
able to see our studies uh from the air

6
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,920
a lot of times you you can see things

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,439
that you wouldn't notice so readily or

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,000
at all uh from the ground so it's been

9
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,198
very useful uh one of the other nice

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,119
things about it is for interested

11
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:56,439
parties who can't make it to the site we

12
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,198
can send them uh photos with plot plan

13
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:02,238
so they can see treatment differences

14
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:05,920
for themselves uh it's very simple to

15
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:11,039
operate you can set it for to take

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:14,000
photos at um any interval you like we we

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:19,200
have it set to take a photo every 5

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,200
seconds and you can also do video

19
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,440
I now can take take the uh memory card

20
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,599
back to the office plug it into my

21
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:19,598
computer and choose the photos that I

22
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,598
want to P but get rid of the

23
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:33,039
rest this has been a production of

24
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:36,039
Cornell University on the web at
