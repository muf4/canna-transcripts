00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
this is a production of cornell

00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,480
university

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,320
welcome to this floorcast episode on

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,080
comparing organic substrates in the last

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,079
few years i have noticed an increased

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,079
interest from growers in using organic

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,479
substrates for growing

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,399
flower and vegetable transplants this

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,000
begs the question what is an organic

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,479
substrate

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,399
that is a substrate or potting mix that

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,480
is derived from naturally occurring

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,320
substances and does not contain

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,238
synthetic materials

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,399
so many of the ingredients that we

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,718
already use in substrates are considered

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,960
organic these would include peats and

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,800
vermiculite perlite

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,640
compost that are prepared according to

20
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,959
nop guidelines

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,039
and then organic fertilizers for

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,280
certified organic production the

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,000
ingredients in an organic substrate must

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,120
meet national organic program or nop

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,119
guidelines

26
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,919
in all cases an operation should check

27
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,839
with their organic certification agent

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,920
so what is not organic about

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,240
conventional potting mixes

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,118
in this table we list the recipe for the

31
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,199
conventional cornell pete light mix

32
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,040
it calls for half a cubic yard of peat

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,680
moss and half a cubic yard of course

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
vermiculite with some various fertilizer

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,560
and wetting agent amendments

36
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:23,199
the peat moss vermiculite and limestone

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,118
are appropriate for organic use but the

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,439
synthetic fertilizers triple super

39
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,079
phosphate potassium nitrate and the

40
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,599
micronutrient charge cannot be used as

41
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,319
well the conventional wetting agent

42
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,919
would not be acceptable for organic use

43
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,679
the objective of the trial that i'm

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,478
going to talk about that was conducted

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,280
with my graduate student stephanie beaks

46
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,200
was to trial several organic substrates

47
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,599
for the growth effects on flour and

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,280
vegetable transplants without additional

49
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,719
fertilizers

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,560
in the trial we wanted to look at a

51
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,798
range of locally regionally and

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,320
nationally available mixes and compare

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,320
them to each other

54
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,319
we have noticed that in particular a lot

55
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,199
of the organic vegetable transplant

56
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:06,000
growers prefer mixes to be pre-loaded

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,600
with a lot of nutrients that may carry

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,719
the plant for four to six weeks of

59
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,799
growth

60
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,560
therefore in the trial we did not add

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,520
additional fertilizer as we wanted to

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,000
see how well growth would do using just

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,120
the fertility from the mixes themselves

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,840
in the trial we took plugs of tomato

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
pepper pansy petunia and snapdragon

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,878
seedlings and we transplanted these in

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,039
four inch pots with which had various

68
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,199
organic mixes

69
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,439
these pots were grown on for six weeks

70
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,679
at a fairly warm greenhouse temperature

71
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,598
of 70 degrees fahrenheit

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,840
and they were watered daily or as needed

73
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,238
with tap water in the trial we did not

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,560
use any additional fertility the

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,599
substrates that we used in the trial

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,640
included

77
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:53,280
a cornell organic mix this is one that

78
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,079
we have prepared using a peat perlite

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,318
and vermicompost recipe that you can see

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,319
here where the vermicompost

81
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,479
is supposed to supply the majority of

82
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,238
the nutrients as well we use dolomitic

83
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,878
limestone to add some calcium and

84
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,680
magnesium and to increase the ph of the

85
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,239
mix

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,920
as well as add green sand rock phosphate

87
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,519
and blood meal to add additional npnk

88
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,359
the other substrates that we used in the

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,519
trial include sunshine natural and

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,000
organic substrates number one and number

91
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,239
four both of these are peat perlite

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,680
based substrates with an organic starter

93
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,319
charge

94
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
two mixes from the vermont compost

95
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,919
company

96
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,319
one is their fort light which contains

97
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,439
peat their compost

98
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,238
perlite

99
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,799
and several different sources of organic

100
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,640
nutrients as well as their fort v which

101
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,120
is similar to fort light but it does not

102
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,919
contain perlite

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,879
we used a locally available

104
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,439
organic mix prepared in upstate new york

105
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,759
that contains peat compost and a poultry

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,239
litter fertilizer

107
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,199
then from the hudson valley we trialed

108
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,759
mcenroe organic farm premium light mix

109
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,919
this mix contains compost peat and

110
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,759
perlite as well as several sources of

111
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,919
organic nutrients

112
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,519
finally from sunshine we also trialled

113
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:16,719
their organic px2 mix which besides peat

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,439
and perlite contains quite a bit of bark

115
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,280
as well as composted peanut shells

116
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,759
we tested the ph and the electrical

117
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,359
conductivity of these mixes before

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,520
planting

119
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,759
for potting mixes the suggested ph

120
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:34,240
before planting would be 5.5 to 6.5

121
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,800
of the mixes that we trialed

122
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,360
the sunshine number one and number four

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,360
mixes as well as the locally formulated

124
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,319
mix had phs above the suggested range

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,639
the cornell and the fort light mixes

126
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,159
were slightly below the suggested range

127
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,040
and the rest of the mixes were within

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,240
that suggested range we also tested the

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,000
pre-plant electrical conductivity or ec

130
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
which is a total measure of the salts

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
which would include both fertilizer

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,400
salts as well as non-fertilizer salts

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,879
such as sodium and chloride

134
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,038
of the mixes that we looked at cornell

135
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,759
sunshine number one and sunshine number

136
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,079
four and the local mix

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,319
had relatively low saturated media

138
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:20,319
extract ec values

139
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:22,399
the px2 was roughly in the normal range

140
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,199
and the fort light the fort v and the

141
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:28,319
mackin row which were formulated with a

142
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,800
large dose of organic nutrients

143
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,918
came in at the high end of the normal

144
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,919
range

145
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,159
next i will show a series of photos

146
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:39,198
demonstrating the results of the plant

147
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,400
growth trials after six weeks

148
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,160
for pepper

149
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,159
we noticed that the largest plants were

150
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,479
found with the fort light

151
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,000
the locally prepared mix and macan row

152
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,240
mix

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,439
as well the cornell mix and the fort v

154
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,079
mix gave suitable plant growth

155
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:59,120
the sunshine mixes sunshine 1 and

156
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:01,519
sunshine 4 and px2 gave fairly small

157
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,840
plant growth and this was expected due

158
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:08,560
to the low starter nutrient charge that

159
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:10,399
was added to these mixes tomato gave

160
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,720
similar results and one of the things

161
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,918
that you can note here

162
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,039
low fertility shows as both small plants

163
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,639
such as the sunshine one and four mixes

164
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,800
so one of the take-home messages for

165
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,639
tomato which is a heavier feeder while

166
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,560
we can grow a large plant with some of

167
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,160
these mixes that have a lot of organic

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,399
fertilizer incorporated into the

169
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,160
substrate they will eventually run out

170
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,959
of that fertilizer

171
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,080
leading to nitrogen deficiency for pansy

172
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,198
we did not include the px2 mix in this

173
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,279
trial

174
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,960
we noted that the mcenroe the fort v the

175
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,119
fort light and the locally prepared

176
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,918
mixes gave the largest plants

177
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,879
cornell mix the second largest and

178
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,318
sunshine one and number four somewhat

179
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,360
smaller plants

180
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,439
for snapdragon we found that the locally

181
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,000
prepared mix was not at all suitable for

182
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,800
growing snapdragons this was potentially

183
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,918
due to a high ammonium charge

184
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,680
in the compost that was used in that mix

185
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,680
for petunia plants it was a similar

186
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,560
story with the largest plants coming

187
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,120
from

188
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,280
fort v mcenroe fort light as well the

189
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,720
local mix was suitable for petunia

190
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,959
production

191
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,319
medium-sized plants from the

192
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,959
cornell mix

193
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,960
and smaller plants from the sunshine 1

194
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,318
and 4 mixes

195
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,279
one of the things that's very evident

196
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,039
from this picture is that the

197
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,359
new growth of the plants

198
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,918
exhibits iron deficiency from many of

199
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,319
the substrates this shows up as

200
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,839
yellowing between the veins on these

201
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,080
upper leaves

202
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,839
therefore one thing to take into account

203
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,000
when using any potting mix whether it's

204
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,079
conventional or organic

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,478
is the starting ph and starting

206
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,680
limestone charge of the mix

207
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:58,240
depending on your water's alkalinity

208
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,160
you may need to use a mix that has a

209
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,160
lower limestone charge

210
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,120
in the previous trial we noticed that

211
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,039
the sunshine mixes were prepared with

212
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,879
only a starter nutrient charge that is

213
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,159
they were not intended to supply all of

214
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,120
the nutrients

215
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,199
for crop growth therefore we wanted to

216
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,160
test one of the mixes sunshine number

217
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,879
four

218
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,280
and

219
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,599
trial two different organic fertilizer

220
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,679
sources first we conducted a trial with

221
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,759
sustain 844

222
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,000
sustain is a poultry litter and

223
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,160
hydrolyzed feather meal based

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
certified organic product the other

225
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,639
organic fertility source that we tried

226
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,799
was worm power vermicompost which has a

227
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,439
lower nutrient charge than the sustain

228
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:43,359
so we used it at higher incorporation

229
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,839
rates we used it at 0 5 10 20 or 30

230
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,560
percent by volume incorporated into the

231
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,959
substrate before transplanting

232
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,439
for the sustained trial we noticed that

233
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:56,239
for pepper about five pounds per cubic

234
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,240
yard gave the best growth

235
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,720
and any additional

236
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,959
applied sustain did not increase the

237
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,680
amount of growth by the plant

238
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,439
for tomato which is a heavier feeder

239
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,278
we noticed that about 10 pounds per

240
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,360
cubic yard

241
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,519
gave good growth of the plant

242
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,680
in the verma compost trial for tomatoes

243
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,600
which are a heavier feeder

244
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,079
we notice that at least 10 percent of

245
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,639
the vermicompost by volume

246
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,360
and really up to 20 percent

247
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,958
uh gave very nice well-fertilized plants

248
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,240
with less symptoms of nutrient

249
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,919
deficiency

250
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,360
from the trial we came away with several

251
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,879
take-home lessons

252
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,560
one is to check with your supplier to

253
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,240
determine the amount of nutrient charge

254
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,159
in the substrate

255
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,320
is the substrate intended to carry the

256
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,120
plant for four to six weeks from the

257
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,040
fertility that's loaded up into it or is

258
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,200
the fertility that's added intended to

259
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,879
service only a starter charge to carry

260
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800
the plant for the first week or two

261
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,879
after transplanting

262
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,559
other lessons that we learned

263
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,120
are that we recommend getting a

264
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,399
laboratory media test done on your

265
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,560
materials

266
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,919
before you plant into them

267
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,759
another lesson

268
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,479
is to monitor the electrical

269
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,159
conductivity or the ec this can be done

270
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,360
both pre-planned with the laboratory

271
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:14,159
media tests or or at home tests

272
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,399
and can also be done throughout the

273
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,159
the growth cycle as well

274
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,320
mix is pre-loaded with heavy nutrients

275
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,120
will have a high ec and you will need to

276
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,720
be careful with salt sensitive seedlings

277
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,759
if you monitor ec throughout the

278
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,000
experiment

279
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,240
a low and decreasing ec is going to

280
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,799
suggest low nutrients and and the amount

281
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,839
of nutrients will be declining over time

282
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,838
finally if you monitor ph over time

283
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,680
this will also be useful we found that

284
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,160
compost and other organic fertilizer

285
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,519
sources such as poultry litter can raise

286
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,120
the p8

287
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,560
a couple final notes are that organic

288
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,560
producers should always consult their

289
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,319
certification agents before purchasing

290
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,078
and using products always conduct your

291
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,240
own in-house trials before using new

292
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,239
materials at full production scale

293
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:05,799
this has been a production of cornell

294
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,799
university on the web at cornell.edu
