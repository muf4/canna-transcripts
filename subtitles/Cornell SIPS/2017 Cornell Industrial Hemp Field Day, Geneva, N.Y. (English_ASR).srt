1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,710
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:15,549
University

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:18,429
I would love to welcome everyone to

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:21,560
Cornell University New York today

5
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:23,239
excellence devastation for the College

6
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,559
of Agriculture and life sciences at

7
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:29,538
Grinnell my name is Kristine smart and

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:32,869
I'm the director of the school of

9
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:37,760
integrated plant sciences our hope for

10
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:39,500
today is actors to dream now everyone I

11
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,349
mean it we're going to introduce story

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,929
of that chemistry at Cornell well at

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,640
least those books are here and then and

14
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:51,049
then you know we'll have some describe

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,920
some of the research what's happening

16
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:57,169
but my goal is really to have folks out

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,000
in the field looking at the hands and

18
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,219
interacting with our health team so once

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,200
you know what goes do you have a

20
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:05,570
question about you know the overall

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,060
project I'm to be honest I'm pretty much

22
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:09,439
the administrator of the project and a

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,060
lot of the other folks here are doing

24
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,920
some of the research so you know if you

25
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,900
have questions about economics you can

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,118
pop in and join who you'll meet if you

27
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,600
have questions about the varieties we

28
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:23,118
have here we have experts on that and so

29
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:25,039
I hope I always think it's supposed to

30
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:29,859
be out and walking around the plants and

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,990
asking questions they're a circle so

32
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:36,069
Europe I don't have that I don't

33
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:36,069
actually have a copy of you

34
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:46,210
but I'm going to go in uh Jamie right so

35
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:48,639
what we have out here is a variety trial

36
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:50,919
and the trial is planted at six

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,349
different locations for near the Ithaca

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:59,409
campus and to here up in Geneva and

39
00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:02,140
Jamie Crawford is here come on okay me

40
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:04,600
and she works for example I am and who

41
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,000
is one of the co leaves on the project

42
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:09,489
and she'll talk briefly about the trial

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,409
and there's a handout there's a handout

44
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:11,860
if you don't have that we can pass those

45
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:16,780
around

46
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,819
so change the plan - ever offered online

47
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,039
he was very excited to be here as we

48
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:22,958
walk through all of you today but um

49
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:29,048
when we first got swag enormous progress

50
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:31,420
or an adventure but we were able to line

51
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:33,969
up the cevis team different varieties

52
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:36,579
will be set up will be out here in the

53
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:39,519
trials today so up you want to grab a

54
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,790
handout after you I got here a little

55
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,459
late I apologize for that so on you can

56
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:48,729
de you know will see the 13 different

57
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:51,039
rings you'll put driving and then we've

58
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:53,199
got four different parts private to just

59
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,620
frying baby's father price that we're

60
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,619
testing

61
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,250
on the on the front of the page we've a

62
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:04,150
little bit of information on the

63
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:07,090
different trials right and plan TV and

64
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,209
the sort of soils that are in those

65
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:14,860
locations sort of everything from very

66
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:16,900
well drained so so like I broadly feel

67
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:20,920
in a family feel and then it got some so

68
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:24,819
much early same spot or also so I'm just

69
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:28,629
sort of see the full spectrum of how all

70
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:33,250
these different locations so for our

71
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:37,389
trial where we planted them and four

72
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:49,379
foot by twenty foot walk and there will

73
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:49,379
be big yield estimates from we aim for

74
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:58,000
and except for one where we notice oil

75
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:58,930
past really kinda need so farmers are

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,629
going to want to know something about

77
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,489
McCoy our clients and that and that that

78
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:06,250
could be a happy visit reinforce creator

79
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:09,009
form to death and even if that has been

80
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:14,769
planting that provides for establishment

81
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:21,969
because we had a closed mouth right

82
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:23,860
after planting and a rain so so if you

83
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,450
guys have plant forms before you know

84
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,819
you don't want to plant it before the

85
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:31,019
football trap right and but has it's

86
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:33,879
even more sensitive and so we have a

87
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:35,859
good establishment and all of our child

88
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,709
except for the one where it got down

89
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,350
into the 40s with a cold rain afterwards

90
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:43,599
and so our first child we have about an

91
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,850
average of twelve plants per square foot

92
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,610
and then the second one is closer in

93
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:51,520
size you know they're only planted five

94
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:55,810
days apart but that got three days when

95
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,430
we're after is really important so on I

96
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,220
mean I can tell you a little bit about

97
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,720
our other trials around the state you

98
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,970
can see the one behind years at this

99
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,030
which is very nice so now it's we'll

100
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:10,770
probably got some of our other one

101
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:12,659
and then I thought okay it mainly want

102
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:15,089
you introduce yourself said yes so I

103
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,830
only answer research and the health

104
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:21,929
research answer in the summer

105
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:25,289
so with the help of our seriously that

106
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:28,350
is liking that on all of our child in

107
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:31,680
any ability to the Henryville on weekly

108
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,320
basis these data include neck on hikes

109
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,660
and and flowering as you can see all

110
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,699
varieties are in bloom now even if I

111
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,390
burn brightly three seven red blue

112
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:44,819
what's later in the people holding that

113
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,789
I've noticed is at the Monte six ready

114
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:50,310
for transplants that have male and

115
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:53,819
female 10 or male female parts on the

116
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:56,250
Pampas a plant flower later in

117
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,610
relationships right money society often

118
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,918
seek out slower but must stay here with

119
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:06,120
a more linear growth rate than the

120
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,680
nicest right the basic ready have have

121
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,840
had a growth spurt earlier in the season

122
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,569
which is declined since the thirties

123
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,339
Clark this pattern of growth of creating

124
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:18,689
major differences in height between the

125
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:21,359
money system value system the money to

126
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:24,149
drag on pretty much all of our files are

127
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,020
between one and three feet taller and

128
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:29,849
like when something that we've also

129
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:32,430
learned for doing these files they're

130
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:37,620
far and then establishments crucial have

131
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:40,290
feelings therapy as I see the soil pipe

132
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,689
implanted evening on some effect on

133
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,970
establishment

134
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:46,100
as we mentioned there first of all this

135
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:49,450
plant is subscribing earlier in our

136
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:53,170
recently trial but the establishment

137
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:56,180
difference is huge and on average our

138
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:59,360
first trials almost two feet taller and

139
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,220
the classical trial perhaps the planting

140
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,650
baking another event we couldn't pull

141
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:08,750
new five-day different but the plants

142
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:12,319
are much shorter and now having trouble

143
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:14,240
up competing the in Ithaca trial also

144
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,800
didn't get the semi additional pounds

145
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,720
the fertilizer which may have a strong

146
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,379
effect estate that happens very heavy

147
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:25,220
Peter and our first child also planted

148
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:27,769
following alfalfa they're planted Alcock

149
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,650
they're planted every year so that may

150
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:33,199
also make a huge difference our late is

151
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:35,509
a good trial second trial and twenty

152
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,990
gallon field this plant with just a day

153
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:40,449
after the first grandchild their agenda

154
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,759
but on average is about seven inches

155
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:48,860
taller we're not sure whether or not

156
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,539
specific soil type or amount of rain we

157
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,520
follow up on fighting the gradient

158
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:56,230
surface trial and it's been some time

159
00:07:52,519 --> 00:08:00,349
like this color is the fall when 70% of

160
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:03,140
the seeds are mature which will be very

161
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,390
soon food and the fiber trial will be

162
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:12,199
harvested between flowering and feedback

163
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:14,240
which probably have insulation are your

164
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,110
notes or your notes posted on the

165
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,139
website

166
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,750
among those little nuggets not yet we

167
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:23,000
don't have any to definitive data yet so

168
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,209
these are some of the observations that

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,959
we've made that we are you know we would

170
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:30,299
have to do what college

171
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:42,179
and when you said fertilize was triple

172
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:45,450
or so in this trial 30 pounds per acre

173
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:48,629
at the 10 20 points and then after they

174
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,700
were up 60 pounds totally that's

175
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:57,958
consistent at all in the collocations

176
00:08:50,700 --> 00:09:00,660
are just here well so I have another

177
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:03,389
trial on another farm here in Geneva and

178
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:06,659
we put triple 19 incorporated that at

179
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:08,069
Atlantic and it was it based on soil

180
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:10,439
test you're trying to balance everything

181
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,740
out that way or or we do it as

182
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:17,700
fertilizers for the part of the research

183
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:20,310
20 years okay let me introduce myself

184
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,778
I'm Larry smart I'm professor and Geneva

185
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,919
program leader in the horticulture

186
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:25,379
section at the school of integrated

187
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:29,429
plant science and I also hold it join

188
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:33,809
1,400 plant breeding a question was

189
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:36,509
about fertility initial set of trials we

190
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:38,429
wanted to keep it fairly simple so we

191
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,350
tried to standardize it with the

192
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:42,899
fertilization project that would

193
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,139
certainly be an important topic that we

194
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,039
want to look at and the freewill trial

195
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:48,958
is organic

196
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,610
okay I'm going to get what we're doing

197
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,519
that's that's straight manure when

198
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:58,620
you're saying or gas yeah there's no

199
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:00,088
it's on certified organic ground the

200
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,049
only fertilizer this beyond there is

201
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:05,610
manure hey fish chicken manure compost I

202
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:09,088
kind of cover crops

203
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:12,169
let me also say that Jan Gilbert Jenkins

204
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:12,170
at our school is due

205
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:20,878
so I just want to talk a little bit

206
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:25,649
about how the governor Commissioner has

207
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,649
hired me to have a midlife crisis here

208
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:36,938
although I did buy a yachtie convertible

209
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:39,040
Express my role in an appointment I've

210
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:40,750
been working for 20 years Willa

211
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,578
bioenergy crops which you can see over

212
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,990
there that's a two year old standard

213
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:48,609
willow but in March we held a half

214
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,948
summit that the lieutenant governor

215
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,810
attended on the campus where she

216
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:56,409
announced four hundred thousand dollar

217
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:58,539
research grant to Cornell and I thought

218
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:00,938
that's great you have a very strong

219
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:03,039
multidisciplinary team and we'll be able

220
00:11:00,938 --> 00:11:07,208
to get some good research done here over

221
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,919
this year next year and we were gearing

222
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:12,250
up for that planting all these trials

223
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:14,559
and then in the beginning of June the

224
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,389
governor said well we need more than

225
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,518
just a few variety trials we need

226
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:21,039
thousands of acres of happen in your

227
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:24,399
city you want to be a leader in the

228
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,338
country income production and those of

229
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,240
us on the Hampton team at Cornell said

230
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:31,300
we'll do the best we can

231
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,000
and we started working together with Tim

232
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:37,208
Sweeney and Jackie show and Chris globe

233
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,958
and see congrat net added markets and

234
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:44,049
the Commissioner and we were able to

235
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:47,289
secure a $900,000 grant through Empire

236
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:48,909
State Development that contract just to

237
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:53,789
give you an idea of the timeline that

238
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:56,889
contract was signed on June 16 Janie and

239
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:59,558
and her colleague Julie Hanson and if

240
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:02,558
occur worked very art with Valley bio

241
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:04,009
and Ontario to order more than 51

242
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:07,819
thousand pounds of

243
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:11,509
normally bio of the cultivar Anka which

244
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:14,390
you see here in the trial and then we

245
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:16,429
work together with eigen markets to line

246
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:18,949
up growers and some of those Rovers are

247
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:22,599
here today might Gardner from farm-fresh

248
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:27,670
first is planted nearly 600 acres ok

249
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:31,550
dance Pope is here from e-commerce and

250
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:32,179
they will have 120 acres planted here

251
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:37,279
buddy

252
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:41,439
by the weekend hopefully it can in

253
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:44,360
totally we will have planted 1700 acres

254
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,940
variety across 25 different farm

255
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,690
settings so I have a handout here just

256
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:55,010
summarized in that our main aim of that

257
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:58,280
project is to get growers inspired and

258
00:12:55,009 --> 00:13:01,279
also to inspire the markets perhaps and

259
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,439
to send the message that New York is

260
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,379
into them in a big way

261
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,780
with strong support from our academic

262
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:14,210
institutions Cornell or SUNY colleagues

263
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:16,429
we will get some data on establishment

264
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,400
methods because all these growers have

265
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:21,439
used different feeders we stand one

266
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:24,259
thing we standardized what's the seeding

267
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,940
rate at 30 pounds per acre although

268
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,710
we've got three different feed Lots

269
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,380
which have different germination rates

270
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:33,800
so that's one of the issues with hemp

271
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:37,610
that Alan Taylor's going to talk about

272
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:41,839
is the variability in germination rates

273
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:45,139
and key Limburger some of our growers

274
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,129
are doing some no-till planting some are

275
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,289
going

276
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:52,370
one of our growers planted with an onion

277
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:55,370
planters Margarethe our perfect baby

278
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:59,179
green which is becoming quite an item

279
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:01,850
apparently some of them will I think be

280
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:03,739
able to combine their fields and we'll

281
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,860
be able to measure yield on a fairly

282
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:09,799
large scale but some of the fields are

283
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,050
still to be planted and those fields are

284
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:16,519
effectively client of the cover comment

285
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:19,969
at this point so that's where we stand

286
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:22,639
with the farmer research trials they

287
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:25,670
also have judge read from Cooperative

288
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:29,149
Extension and we have a team of eight or

289
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:31,669
ten poking out from across the state to

290
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:33,289
help support those farmers and to learn

291
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:35,719
more about mountain so that they have a

292
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,929
strong support network as we move

293
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,930
forward

294
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:43,869
Krister can you introduce yourself so do

295
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:46,159
you want me to do that boy is no success

296
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,750
and actually after you're finished maybe

297
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,769
if we could just have the extension

298
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,039
folks that are here introduce themselves

299
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:54,278
sure I think you did good morning

300
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:57,559
everyone my name is Justin Reid with

301
00:14:54,278 --> 00:15:00,759
Cornell competition team called harvest

302
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,208
New York the end to work at look at new

303
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,149
emerging crops

304
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:07,159
emerging markets and do a lot of we do a

305
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:10,970
lot of work for starters in terms of the

306
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:13,278
analyzing value chains for New York

307
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,190
farmers and so industrial not being a

308
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:20,028
new problem really fit into that the

309
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:22,639
type of working with you so how they can

310
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:27,860
find Cheryl there who works out of our

311
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:30,889
area Tony office put together a

312
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,589
a report and economic report on the

313
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:36,740
potential industrial happen in New York

314
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:38,390
State this is available at domina on the

315
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,899
table where you sign it I encourage you

316
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:43,578
to grab that on your way out of the day

317
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:47,000
what we try to do is look at what is the

318
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:49,669
potential of industrial hemp or of your

319
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,820
father's in terms of was returned per

320
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:56,299
acre and to do that we needed to begin

321
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,700
to look at what is yield per acre

322
00:15:56,299 --> 00:16:02,449
what is the fighters need what are the

323
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,890
input talking and the first thing you'll

324
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,620
notice we look at our reports that

325
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:08,778
there's not a lot of data out there some

326
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,450
from different provinces in Canada

327
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:16,250
Alberta Manitoba material and then just

328
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:17,930
a few feet as well yield 3 here

329
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,909
somewhere around a thousand pounds

330
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:22,338
possibly but I've got to believe that

331
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:24,199
could be higher too if you can't you

332
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:25,940
need to get us in earlier so that was

333
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,480
really more of a regulatory issue than

334
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:31,190
an agronomic issue 50 to go see so I'm a

335
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,028
little concerned that any data that you

336
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:37,190
look at from 2017 does truly reflect the

337
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:39,860
soil potential office problem

338
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,959
if we were able to get this edit on and

339
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,519
get in the ground earlier I imagine that

340
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,289
that field is going to be a lot higher

341
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,000
the other thing we have to look at when

342
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:49,278
it comes to yield is what what are we

343
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,379
talking about fiber or mountain without

344
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:55,429
Steve was the potential market of equity

345
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:58,759
and that's going to influence our

346
00:16:55,429 --> 00:17:01,189
economics quite a bit since this is a

347
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:03,528
new problem there's a lot of interesting

348
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:06,529
other potential uses of it and vari

349
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:09,289
mentioned beanie greens as well so easy

350
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:12,289
this is a balanced opponent perhaps

351
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:14,298
grown in size greenhouses and so I know

352
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:15,859
there's some market farmers that are

353
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:20,209
looking at this now and will walk out

354
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:22,879
and I think 20 P everything some of the

355
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:25,308
funds that the governor announced on

356
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,709
that second announcement of funding will

357
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:30,019
probably gonna start looking at finally

358
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:33,230
has a baby green inside of greenhouses

359
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:35,929
in Geneva and difficult hopefully will a

360
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,019
production information on answer we also

361
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:42,730
explore what we use force legality of

362
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:46,158
that of growing them out as a baby green

363
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:48,079
selling it to a restaurant actually this

364
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:53,090
is the most interesting backup I've ever

365
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:55,788
had I grew a bunch of baby had big green

366
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:57,619
happen and fell to whatever consumer

367
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:59,390
whether that's the third thing we wanted

368
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,759
to tour make sure that people understand

369
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:05,090
that they're navigating those markets of

370
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:07,839
the progress anything out sessions they

371
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:07,839
employ workers

372
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:15,798
there's production specialist here as

373
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:17,798
well that have more economic knowledge

374
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:20,509
some of those people are like hunter

375
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:22,960
reference counting ingredients down to

376
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:26,028
might be entered some faith as well

377
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,980
there's Mike welcome I'm just a janitor

378
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:30,740
here right now a people

379
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,139
Jan any other production blocker

380
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:37,569
extensively loss prevention Peter

381
00:18:33,138 --> 00:18:37,569
carefrontation Peter Landry is our boss

382
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:45,168
okay so one of the thing that harvest

383
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,569
the earth wants to do is understand

384
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:50,990
better the profitability of this crop

385
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:53,240
and do that we need to understand what

386
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,130
are the yield limit right that we've

387
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,950
seen from your Connors so if you're

388
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:01,460
growing and this year we might expect

389
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:04,159
they hear from Cheryl fair against what

390
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,720
I work with or Lindsey massive oil for

391
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:06,980
workers at harvest New York try to

392
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,259
understand the market better what are

393
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,528
the prices received so that we can begin

394
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:14,720
to create some transparency in value

395
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:17,000
chain I think one of the real potentials

396
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,230
for this crop is we can grow up there's

397
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,480
probably a lot of other people to grow

398
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,899
up well too but are we going to have

399
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,558
some sort of competitive advantage with

400
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:29,869
locally big market locally New York baby

401
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:32,538
prophecies it looks like there's a very

402
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:34,869
good keep on that bus out there

403
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:37,808
Chris or Larry

404
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:40,058
to ask us Jerry talk about the economics

405
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:43,960
you guys get up close the prices you

406
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:45,369
guys pay for the vertices anyone yeah I

407
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,100
would say we would so what would we do

408
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:52,558
to probably update this document we 2017

409
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:56,649
you data much real dated we get honors

410
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:59,259
people put themself what my technology

411
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,330
is getting and healthy to stop so should

412
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:03,009
I divide nine hundred thousand by fifty

413
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:05,460
thousand did you spend all nine hundred

414
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:05,460
thousand on

415
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:13,150
the question is what was that budget of

416
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,179
the nine hundred thousand so these

417
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:19,269
growers are being compensated by the

418
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:21,910
acre again affected the seeding rates at

419
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:24,308
thirty pounds very good so gave them the

420
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:27,160
exact right amount of feed their target

421
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:29,019
acreage they're being compensated $400

422
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,529
very group let's that causes the team's

423
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:35,289
not to exceed $50 per acre so yeah that

424
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:36,849
word you got the seed for two bucks we

425
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:39,129
have to take their dollar ninety eight

426
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:45,428
amount yep Formica including shipping

427
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:47,920
from Ontario job so let me introduce

428
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:50,620
professor Gary Bertram in ecology and

429
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,900
kind of apology thanks Larry I get to

430
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:55,239
see everybody this morning so I'm a

431
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,390
member of me pass a team if you will and

432
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,829
that includes Elson shields and

433
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:03,040
entomology I don't think Elson could

434
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:06,009
make it today my laboratory is very

435
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:09,099
interested in trying to to look ahead to

436
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:11,529
some of the infectious disease problems

437
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:15,369
that we may encounter that I sure will

438
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:18,849
encounter Jamie Cummings here and Kevin

439
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:21,159
Myers are with my group and we are

440
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:23,230
looking forward to working with many of

441
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,420
you trying the crop in commercial

442
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:29,319
production to help you out with

443
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:30,910
diagnosing problems I attended at our

444
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,589
professional plant pathology meetings

445
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,170
last week through a special session on

446
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:38,329
have been kind of us general diseases

447
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:41,240
and one of the things that we heard is

448
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:45,470
that there's this myth there are no pest

449
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:48,170
problems cannabis that is quite untrue

450
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,480
and in fact what I heard from how they

451
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,519
can Kentucky Indiana and some other

452
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,799
states that and then may be working on

453
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,930
this a little longer than us that

454
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,899
there's been kind of an explosion of

455
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:01,700
realizing past problems and down the

456
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,800
road as we increase the acreage in the

457
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,259
in Tennessee we will have a number of

458
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,539
things to deal with and I think as the

459
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:11,500
course of the morning goes on here if

460
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:14,450
you don't know already because of the

461
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:17,299
status of this is a is it really a crop

462
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,660
sort of idea or is it a Schedule one

463
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:20,029
drug

464
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,650
depending on which which agency you're

465
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:24,710
talking to there are no registered

466
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:27,590
pesticides in this problem so in that

467
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:30,329
sense we're all going to be looking at

468
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:32,220
organic production

469
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:34,529
at least the initial years of this and

470
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,360
so that does present some problems some

471
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:38,730
challenges to us and we'll learn about

472
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,379
that together it means it will be the

473
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,690
work on some cultural practices and

474
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,020
getting things like the sequencing of

475
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:49,170
crops we want to avoid crops that have

476
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:51,180
similar spectrum spectrum of diseases

477
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,100
one that we're somewhat concerned about

478
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,049
New York State because of our revisions

479
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:57,269
is white molds they're getting white

480
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:59,399
mold because if we're in rotation with

481
00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:01,889
things like soybean a member of our

482
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,980
vegetable crops we already have issues

483
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:07,800
with that so we know that has quite

484
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,089
susceptible to that but and the other

485
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,700
thing I learned from this

486
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:13,679
supposin last week that the spectrum of

487
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,049
problems on the greenhouse grown like

488
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,000
for the Bates green is almost completely

489
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:19,409
different spectrum of problems than what

490
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,660
we encounter in production of the field

491
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:24,930
so we need to be attuned to that as well

492
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,120
so I'm not going to belabor a lot of

493
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,549
Latin names with you here and a number

494
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:32,309
of pests that we're going to be on the

495
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:34,500
lookout for and I just want you to know

496
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:37,230
that that we're here to serve and work

497
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,940
with you on on diagnosing and learning

498
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:43,289
together how we can best manage some of

499
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:47,420
those problems so Thank You Alison all

500
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:47,420
right you have for introducing yourself

501
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:55,339
welcome gente it is quite a turnout that

502
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:59,079
we have given this morning we had just

503
00:23:55,339 --> 00:24:02,089
two ways to go the Indigo the first

504
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:04,250
you'll say they're ahead about an equal

505
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:08,899
turnout so really appreciate that the

506
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,710
interest maybe I have a curiosity on

507
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:16,160
this crowd

508
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:19,460
so Who am I and my name's Alan Taylor

509
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,500
I'm a faculty here at the Experiment

510
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,740
Station professor and seat Science and

511
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:27,470
Technology so my involvement in this

512
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:30,620
project is really looking at the quality

513
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:33,769
aspects starting to see testing how the

514
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:36,259
different lines and rise and the out

515
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:39,349
here but also to go further action

516
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:40,470
research my research has developed

517
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:43,148
complete

518
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:45,038
but I want to thank this person really

519
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:47,349
beginning this work is really to talk

520
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:52,058
about seek quality and what does that

521
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:54,278
mean just again just from the how we

522
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:57,009
define disease for those are either not

523
00:24:54,278 --> 00:25:00,489
really familiar with agronomic prompts

524
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:02,128
you all to destroy two components is one

525
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:05,139
is determination we would all expect

526
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:07,418
obviously the events of Germany the

527
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:09,998
second part is called curative appear to

528
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:12,788
the seed lot is we really just want see

529
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:15,249
and you open up that bag of Anka to plan

530
00:25:12,788 --> 00:25:18,128
on your farm you want to just account

531
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:20,669
the seat of that particular variety what

532
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:23,949
else could be there could be other crops

533
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:26,739
there can be weeds you to tree noxious

534
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,269
weed seed may be present itself those

535
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:30,340
leaves meat in there you're also

536
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:31,989
planning we'd keep in your fund and then

537
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:34,749
finally just entered matter which is all

538
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:38,319
just trash material things like that so

539
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:41,980
there are some standards first of all is

540
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:44,230
how as we had to import seeds from all

541
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,690
these trial to coming from two main

542
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:50,909
companies seed companies up in Canada

543
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:53,320
and the less from from Europe of

544
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:55,419
learning more about the Canadian system

545
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:59,678
as there are close neighbors here to the

546
00:25:55,419 --> 00:26:01,690
north personally they have to have an 8

547
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,999
was permitted and heythis permit is a

548
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:06,519
very general just allows them to export

549
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:08,858
see there's really no specifications

550
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:11,019
requirements as far as the germination

551
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:13,898
is considered a germination test is

552
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:16,960
performed on the sea also not just we

553
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:19,898
cannot just read to define invited state

554
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,389
or for the problem to be considered

555
00:26:19,898 --> 00:26:24,008
harmful to agriculture and the only

556
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:26,709
other thing that's report is if there's

557
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:29,179
other prophecies in excess of five

558
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,069
percent of quite bills point across

559
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:34,038
so you say where are these other top

560
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:36,499
seats coming from Gary mentioned there

561
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:37,848
are no labels pesticides and that

562
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:41,479
includes herbicide

563
00:26:37,848 --> 00:26:44,928
so the Grimes death planet I is Michael

564
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:49,038
loosen my program is here now there are

565
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:51,320
we found both seed sunflower but we had

566
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,450
a number of different contaminant other

567
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:56,388
crops these are already present in them

568
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:59,749
not something it's really nice design so

569
00:26:56,388 --> 00:27:03,468
anyway we are in a point right now out

570
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:05,838
of just basically of Kevin see important

571
00:27:03,469 --> 00:27:07,849
to us and particulars in New York's

572
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:10,579
Daniel brought the production of this

573
00:27:07,848 --> 00:27:12,979
product Canada is has some such

574
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:14,569
standards I want to talk about that they

575
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:16,129
have a certification we're familiar with

576
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:18,138
seeing certification here but there's a

577
00:27:16,128 --> 00:27:20,658
little different they have certification

578
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:23,329
level one number one or number two

579
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:25,820
so what what is the criteria for them so

580
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:27,678
if it's a certified number one who the

581
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:32,118
seed I will have to be over 85 percent

582
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:35,479
germination that's have three or less we

583
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:37,459
please present and a 25-grand sample and

584
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:41,989
then it's less than one o'clock 1:04

585
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,879
left proxy so 25 grams is a lot of shots

586
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:46,338
also I think everybody can understand

587
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:48,199
that volume information of what that is

588
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:50,928
so those are the criterion for number

589
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,298
one if it fails we'll see might even

590
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:55,969
blow Jenner germination or there's other

591
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:57,888
more weakly present then the next

592
00:27:55,969 --> 00:28:00,619
category is there number two and that

593
00:27:57,888 --> 00:28:03,498
case the germination needs to be 17

594
00:28:00,618 --> 00:28:05,718
percent or higher and then higher

595
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:09,048
threshold a number of weeks eat and the

596
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:12,019
other crop seed would be present so we

597
00:28:09,048 --> 00:28:14,269
have 17 Lots out here I should took 17

598
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:17,479
full riders but I think really a seed

599
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:20,028
lot level feedlot level of a variety and

600
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:23,450
each block can vary from one of those

601
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:25,489
put in the same variety but of the data

602
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:28,038
that we collected so far Michael in my

603
00:28:25,489 --> 00:28:30,090
laboratory only 30 percent of those

604
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:32,129
would have greater than 85

605
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:35,278
termination and only about half of that

606
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:37,830
folder 70% so you see it quality to see

607
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,470
that were were important care can be

608
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:43,649
very very fulfilling very concerned

609
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:46,650
about that so having a good quality seek

610
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:49,650
is it's very important to get started on

611
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:51,509
the right the booklet in communication

612
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,820
was one of the Canadian seed companies

613
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:55,859
again because they're what even they

614
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:58,649
call their certified it's not exactly

615
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:00,569
what we are you find out then you're

616
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,980
going to based on our conversations

617
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:04,798
actually put on the percent germination

618
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,870
and the thousand three point so again

619
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,569
things that we reduced to on earth ste

620
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:12,028
tags they do not require that but since

621
00:29:09,569 --> 00:29:14,700
they are exporting that's something that

622
00:29:12,028 --> 00:29:18,450
they had so I think that will be helpful

623
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:20,278
for next year as we look forward so

624
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,960
again we're focused right now I'm just

625
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:25,409
doing the standard protein test

626
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,179
following standardized procedures NEC

627
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:29,309
testing laboratory in the United States

628
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,809
or Canada is following the same rules

629
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:33,210
but from there we're going to move

630
00:29:30,808 --> 00:29:35,970
forward and looking at see quality and

631
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,190
see bigger aspects can we develop a

632
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,440
practical see make yourself especially

633
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,240
as Jamie's talking about and your

634
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,909
witness soil condition you get a good

635
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,370
spin and the cold white condition you

636
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:49,919
know the stand is reduced over over

637
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:51,719
fifty percent so we need to better

638
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,270
understand see quality and other

639
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,399
horrible high-quality feel I I figure

640
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:58,168
see what really feel like that by that

641
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,148
the standard generations that simply

642
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:03,690
does not have a college of assault

643
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:06,000
please Twitter the other aspect is we're

644
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:08,370
setting up with a fairly weak speed to

645
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,200
begin with once they get established and

646
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:12,209
growing when they grow pretty vigorously

647
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,970
as you can see out yet but it's that

648
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:17,130
very early germination early feelings

649
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,839
that is those are the critical stages of

650
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:21,570
getting up up and growing out of thrown

651
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:23,459
so so we're interested in kind of the

652
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:25,230
key technology tools that we're

653
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,429
developing really for small seeded

654
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,128
vegetables and also

655
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:31,559
organic production of seed enhancements

656
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:34,469
to try to enhance to stimulate that

657
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:36,599
early seedling growth but also as you do

658
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:39,149
not have any chemical seed treatments

659
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:42,118
that we can use to control fungal

660
00:30:39,148 --> 00:30:45,689
diseases of what can we do can again

661
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:48,808
going to be organic toolbox and see can

662
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:51,240
we use that and apply those in supers so

663
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:52,618
I think for sake of time as if there's

664
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,138
any questions at this time

665
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:58,528
these are germination rates of the

666
00:30:55,138 --> 00:31:00,658
leaves posted some are not at this time

667
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:02,909
but we will be doing any work we're

668
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:05,940
calling a lot of information right now

669
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:08,639
in the field and elephants and other

670
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,200
girlfriends or so so for all of roll of

671
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:12,058
postings we've got to go through a whole

672
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,360
process before they're all posted is

673
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:17,509
like fall or or can you post notes as

674
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:17,508
you go

675
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:24,569
always press handle that one key keeping

676
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:27,240
it so the question was can we talk to

677
00:31:24,569 --> 00:31:27,538
know if there's ago and yet we can make

678
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,079
it

679
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:33,359
yeah incomplete data is not useful so I

680
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,009
think James you don't have all generates

681
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,219
from all the people on and probably not

682
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:40,740
useful okay yes and that and what those

683
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,139
will be posted we do have a blog that

684
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:50,038
Jamie Commons is in charge of and Joey

685
00:31:43,138 --> 00:31:53,418
upsides to coverage and and everything

686
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:56,490
will be posted on the website

687
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:58,710
Correll half website and you know that

688
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,990
will go up as soon as possible the only

689
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:05,740
trick is we're planning for extras right

690
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:08,140
so then some data right would be helpful

691
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,609
as opposed to waiting for the if it has

692
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,830
to go through a publication process

693
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:14,379
which I understand has to happen wrong

694
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:18,460
official stuff but if he night and there

695
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:20,710
was like a informal okay aligning larger

696
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,900
plant production Eurasian yeah and I'm

697
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:24,910
happy to have great personal

698
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,769
conversation rather than posting things

699
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:29,050
really before they're ready

700
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:32,200
thank you that goes in it and sorry Beth

701
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:34,359
white yes today while we're here might

702
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,860
often gave me a second you know the hope

703
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:37,269
is that we'll wander around and you'll

704
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:38,889
actually be able to talk to the folks

705
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:40,839
that have a greener and get that

706
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,460
information you can come you know as

707
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:44,259
preliminary data as soon as you close

708
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,420
something sellable download it and then

709
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:48,400
they won't have the final version so

710
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,519
that's a bit of a nervousness about our

711
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,860
target but I also want to say to be a

712
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,808
little bit careful high-speed data it's

713
00:32:53,859 --> 00:33:00,549
not the same a variety a doctor because

714
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:03,129
you know we got to feed lots and a

715
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:05,470
variety title that were just awful and

716
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,880
it was because we're old feed lot it's

717
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:09,400
understood anything about those

718
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,750
varieties in particular so we need to

719
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:16,870
careful about that as well thank you

720
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:21,519
preserver cooking for very different I'm

721
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:27,189
not really LM now you talk about seed

722
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:30,009
enhancement about goofy-looking - okay

723
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:31,960
so the question is what we call it seed

724
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:34,420
enhancement see enhance this is kind of

725
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,660
a general term which would be the seed

726
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,800
treatments could be a beneficial seek

727
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,710
treatment such as

728
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:44,889
trichoderma would be as a seed treatment

729
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:47,500
to control saw borne pathogens things

730
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:49,980
like that but we also have what we call

731
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,480
my Oh stimulants which are actually

732
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,670
different natural plant materials to

733
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,250
actually enhance the germination rate

734
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:59,679
and these two can kind of going concert

735
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:02,619
together so the ultimate goal here is to

736
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,559
protect but also to enhance the early

737
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:08,369
termination and stand establishment good

738
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:08,369
question or clarification

739
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:13,349
question together we able to desk

740
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,349
generation will different eating

741
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:16,349
disorder

742
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:25,599
the question is on my seeing them alert

743
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:28,059
various abuse and HRT on e85

744
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,219
right so I think because we have the

745
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:33,849
same variety kinda unfit different sites

746
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:35,919
will get an idea of that consistency by

747
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:38,739
variety of cross versus different sites

748
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:45,789
or rust on your site so I think they're

749
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:48,609
pretty good replication of that the

750
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:51,940
salad green is that being grow that

751
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:53,769
hypertonic revisit the ones that I see

752
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,889
are not drawn hydroponic they're grown

753
00:34:53,769 --> 00:35:01,960
in soft food is that we've seen as well

754
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:03,609
yeah what we're curious style is Wesley

755
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,860
and the first question would be what's

756
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:08,170
infertility approach to that and it's

757
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:11,740
going to be organic inside a greenhouse

758
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:12,820
that makes a little bit finesse to get

759
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:16,239
those fulfilled in bubble

760
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:19,990
recipe particularly around some night

761
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:22,149
conditions were negative not available

762
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:26,429
sorry for females are usually on time

763
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:31,780
for work and professional will be like

764
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:33,789
are the Canadians going much but we

765
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,610
cookbooks I thought through everything

766
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:38,489
is for the Pearlman we proceed at some

767
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:41,530
fiber not food

768
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:43,419
alright so Peter did you have anything

769
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:46,840
you wanted to add before I pass it on to

770
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:49,269
Jackie okay so we're looking at are

771
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:53,410
there any comments from Phillip field

772
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:56,949
coming farms you go to build it you want

773
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:58,899
to draw three controls an issue tell you

774
00:35:56,949 --> 00:36:00,489
I to plants in some of these fields in

775
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,639
the grass and projects you can find it

776
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:06,099
there there's anybody doing and just

777
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:08,440
throw in on that topic is that Calvin

778
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:11,409
has been digging wheat counts in the

779
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,809
general week pressure and there is trial

780
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:17,109
and it's directly correlated to that

781
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:19,210
initial stand so as a cultural practice

782
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:23,650
getting a good initial stand is very

783
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:27,190
good common issue histories yeah but

784
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:30,309
very good I showed up today feeling like

785
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:32,200
wow that was supposed to look laughs so

786
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:33,880
that was Mike and Gary thing that we

787
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:37,509
control is definitely an issue and we've

788
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,190
seen that it subsides as well and I

789
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,510
encourage everyone now you know sort of

790
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,250
who knows what that when we begin to

791
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:44,200
walk around you can ask for more

792
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:47,969
questions so judges

793
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:50,289
the formative 8 one thing thanks Chris

794
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:53,049
morning everyone

795
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:55,119
it's very exciting for us get out of the

796
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:58,089
office and come out see the crop in

797
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,430
production and we're very excited about

798
00:36:58,088 --> 00:37:03,070
potential here for this profit to

799
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:07,809
something emerging for New York State

800
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:10,838
growers and very thankful to Cornell

801
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:13,059
layering prison that CCE team for

802
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:14,980
helping us in this area and also I'd be

803
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:17,619
remiss if I do not mention our

804
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:20,710
appreciation concluding words now who

805
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:22,690
really led the way and a lot of what is

806
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,460
going on now that we have they were

807
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:28,510
growing last year so we have a little

808
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:30,608
bit of history not much I'm the

809
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:32,200
regulator that's here are representing

810
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:36,969
the regulatory facet of this this has

811
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:40,029
been a very cumbersome difficult area to

812
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:42,848
navigate and I also have to take the

813
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:44,980
time to thanks the Aggie market screen

814
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:47,260
because while I represent the

815
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,599
Commissioner's Office and the governor

816
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,680
I've got a great group of people and the

817
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,619
Commissioner and the great group of

818
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:56,769
people behind him and working in office

819
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:59,880
Kim Sweeney is here who's special

820
00:37:56,769 --> 00:38:02,530
successful Estevez is now targeting

821
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,930
industrial hemp many of you know Chris

822
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:08,170
globe our division director of Plant

823
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:11,129
Industry he is up to here in it and then

824
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:14,440
absolutely while you don't see them

825
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:18,579
they're very essential and that is our

826
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:21,720
counsel's office to start out we all

827
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:24,880
need to know that 2014 federal farm bill

828
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:27,219
provides a good 40 to State Department

829
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,010
of Agriculture and educational

830
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:32,500
institutions to conduct agricultural

831
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:35,500
research projects on industrial hemp and

832
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,809
I have to emphasize the word research on

833
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,550
New York State in the legislature and

834
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:42,900
the governor signed a couple pieces of

835
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:45,789
legislation for the laws of the plate

836
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,119
allow us to move forward with pilot

837
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:51,210
programs

838
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,339
that allow us to grow process they have

839
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:55,920
a Dell products from those research

840
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:59,100
projects and LEDs what you've heard here

841
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,970
this morning is our partnership with

842
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:04,619
Cornell initially with the $400,000 in

843
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:06,029
these preliminary research trials but

844
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:09,150
then to take it out in the field and

845
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:13,050
start gathering some agronomic data on

846
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:16,190
farms across new york i have to

847
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:18,510
emphasize that it is the growers

848
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:21,599
responsibility to identify a feed to

849
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:26,850
work international seed must be a

850
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:29,039
painter to eat a authorized source at

851
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:32,610
the governor's direction the department

852
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,860
is working towards getting a DEA permit

853
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:38,490
where we will be able once it's in place

854
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:40,950
to facilitate be coming into the state

855
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:42,750
from international sources we are in the

856
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:45,509
process of that we have been in the

857
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:48,150
process for quite a while on that and

858
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:51,110
we're hopeful to get that in place so

859
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:53,639
that we can go out with a solicitation

860
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:55,890
hopefully towards the fall with enough

861
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:57,239
time that farmers that are interested

862
00:39:55,889 --> 00:40:00,059
farmers and businesses that are

863
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:02,519
interested in doing research project and

864
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:05,909
identity search identifies the source

865
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:08,759
and then of we would work with them to

866
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:11,309
facilitate is getting to the farms and

867
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,190
to businesses so we are in the process

868
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:16,619
of that stay tuned as I said we're

869
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,780
hoping to do a solicitation or to look

870
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,969
for some more research projects on this

871
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:26,280
fall

872
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:30,689
being on the sea front we are focusing

873
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:32,370
our efforts internally on the need for

874
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:34,950
good viable seed you've heard a lot of

875
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:37,829
conversations about that here this

876
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:41,639
morning we're looking at our feet lab

877
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:44,579
too many to run some tests on some of

878
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:47,819
those things that Alan has mentioned as

879
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:50,279
far as germination and there etc we're

880
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,068
also looking and with one of the

881
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,199
initiatives underway

882
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:58,150
a little time but in speed certification

883
00:40:54,199 --> 00:41:01,940
program in New York State in this area

884
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:04,400
one of the big things and I forgot to

885
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:08,059
mention it is this program initially

886
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:11,180
starting out with ten sites that were

887
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:13,789
authorized by state law and we as an

888
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:17,088
agency decided to start out with

889
00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:19,999
educational institutions with them and

890
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:22,909
had four of those institutions come

891
00:41:19,998 --> 00:41:26,419
forward Cornell being one and then we

892
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:28,308
look to the tremendous leadership and

893
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,108
getting growers involved and businesses

894
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:32,690
involved we expanded those names the

895
00:41:30,108 --> 00:41:34,578
private business with the farms the

896
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:38,139
governor stated they came out but now

897
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:41,349
we're opening up we need to be growing

898
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:46,068
looking at this from beyond Penn State

899
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:50,390
so we do have the ability to expand the

900
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:54,199
program and but they look at other

901
00:41:50,389 --> 00:41:56,088
research projects we have a working we

902
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:57,858
also announced an industrial health

903
00:41:56,088 --> 00:42:01,038
working group which is coming together

904
00:41:57,858 --> 00:42:05,239
we hope to have discussions about where

905
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:08,569
the areas of B are in a research arena

906
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:10,458
the thing is help guide the needs in C

907
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:15,458
and as to what kind of projects we look

908
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:19,429
for and we're also on the processing and

909
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:20,929
looking for an a rolling kind of

910
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:22,940
application that's what we're

911
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:26,049
considering our rolling applications for

912
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,780
processors versus a certain time frame

913
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:33,580
to grow us you'll have an application

914
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:37,690
period we're also investigating just a

915
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:39,880
process or lights just to know where the

916
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:41,950
processes are where the consistent old

917
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,880
small markets are for the product so

918
00:42:41,949 --> 00:42:48,579
that they are on our radar screen

919
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,789
the there's also through partnering with

920
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:54,519
entire state development they come out

921
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:56,980
with processing grants up to $500,000

922
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:59,590
from processing grant and we're also

923
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:01,329
working funding from initial

924
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:06,240
conversations with the Department of

925
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:06,239
Health with respect of any of the food

926
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:14,079
supplement area so that's spent on those

927
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,910
conversations and I think that is also

928
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,849
we are regulations that are in place

929
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:21,099
currently to current started out with

930
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:24,029
educational institutions or regulations

931
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:26,829
that are on the books solely pertain to

932
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:28,420
educational institutions the other

933
00:43:26,829 --> 00:43:30,009
entities that are involved in this

934
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:33,099
program have been operating under

935
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:35,440
Department guidance and partnership

936
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:40,839
agreements with the agency we are

937
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:43,960
looking to lose that arena into some

938
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:46,090
kind of regulatory framer framework and

939
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,670
while we're looking at the regulations

940
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:50,590
we are trying to minimize them so we

941
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:53,650
initially came out with a program that

942
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:55,450
had a lot of checks checking the boxes

943
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:58,539
making sure I think we're fairly much

944
00:43:55,449 --> 00:44:02,109
more comfortable with the program and so

945
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:03,699
we would be facing potentially making

946
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:07,180
regulatory changes

947
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:11,769
lightens up on the regulations that are

948
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:14,108
in place and also brings the cleanest

949
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:16,420
guidance into regulation and that's

950
00:44:14,108 --> 00:44:20,818
really sort of protection of everyone

951
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:24,970
involved body Phillip Schedule one drug

952
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:27,269
so everyone needs to keep at the top of

953
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:29,588
their mind in their labor exploring in

954
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:31,150
Depok attended I'm it's just the

955
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:34,088
guidance documents being updated you

956
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:44,889
know should be religious along with the

957
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:47,230
new application phonetic the so I think

958
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:49,210
what we're waiting were somewhat sitting

959
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,849
tight because we'd like to give VP a

960
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:53,559
permit that's really where we are as an

961
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:58,660
agency we're trying to get to be a

962
00:44:53,559 --> 00:45:00,460
permit we have communication probably

963
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:02,259
bit have been two weeks got to be a

964
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:05,470
little don't want to handle too much

965
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:07,510
behind the very fine line so we're

966
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:10,169
navigating it we are very diligent I

967
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:13,510
mean this is coming from the top this is

968
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:15,940
something that the agency has involved

969
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:18,880
in in a very big way but it is

970
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:21,519
complicated and I think we've got a

971
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:26,530
pretty good job so far everybody

972
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:29,858
involved has been huge undertaking you

973
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:32,380
guys have been awesome I I love it one

974
00:45:29,858 --> 00:45:34,480
of the best partnership and you give us

975
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,519
a little bit on you're gonna have a

976
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,929
large volume of testing with these two

977
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:39,159
thousand acres and there can you give us

978
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:42,639
a little bit on the state of readiness

979
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:44,710
we start taking our kids eat us I would

980
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:48,730
have fortunately I don't have Chris here

981
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:51,818
with I don't have a plan I think solve

982
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:53,500
it but a day maybe I don't appreciate

983
00:45:51,818 --> 00:45:55,630
the adventure but I think I have to do

984
00:45:53,500 --> 00:46:00,190
it you know source seed in

985
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:01,838
comfort level fair we have to make sure

986
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:04,210
that's another issue that we're working

987
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:07,358
through it's lab has MIDI and rotate

988
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:09,999
that is a huge issue it slows and we are

989
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:13,150
all I can say is we're aware that we are

990
00:46:09,998 --> 00:46:16,449
working every day on that issue the

991
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:20,528
capability for the regulatory agencies

992
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:22,659
is for regulatory example and then you

993
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:24,759
have the whole kind of service sector

994
00:46:22,659 --> 00:46:27,248
that's out there that growers that want

995
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:28,420
to have their intercom tested and that's

996
00:46:27,248 --> 00:46:32,199
a whole nother reason

997
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:36,249
oh no way whoops me it's native looking

998
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:39,068
for those and I was made that design you

999
00:46:36,248 --> 00:46:40,689
know moving across state lines all

1000
00:46:39,068 --> 00:46:44,139
across state lines could have you do all

1001
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:46,108
of that in your own room until it to

1002
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:49,420
answer your question a little bit mark

1003
00:46:46,108 --> 00:46:51,639
we do have cooperation with our

1004
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:54,608
Institute of biotechnology on the Ithaca

1005
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:57,190
campus to test all the samples from the

1006
00:46:54,608 --> 00:47:00,369
six trials all 70 varieties for the

1007
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:03,130
whole cannabinoid spectrum of compounds

1008
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:05,769
and then again in talking with Chris

1009
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:08,739
lobe because Anka is a certified

1010
00:47:05,768 --> 00:47:11,258
cultivar in Canada are concerned about

1011
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:13,989
that a little bit less gotcha

1012
00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:15,150
yes always a cannabinoid profile we test

1013
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:19,318
flavonoid

1014
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:19,318
oh that's a good question

1015
00:47:19,478 --> 00:47:22,838
so I've been even no one that's been

1016
00:47:21,009 --> 00:47:25,869
talking to Josh Rose who is the head of

1017
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:28,599
our metabolomic facilities at Cornell

1018
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:32,048
he's a plant biologist in the school of

1019
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:34,798
high sciencism he said that to start

1020
00:47:32,048 --> 00:47:39,278
with they're planning to do that

1021
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:41,619
cannibal not get a cannabidiol panel so

1022
00:47:39,278 --> 00:47:43,630
more than just the CBD you know a more

1023
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:45,430
broad panel because a lot of folks are

1024
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:47,650
going to want to know you know what all

1025
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:49,210
is available and and that that's not a

1026
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:53,680
regulatory issue that's just an

1027
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:56,409
informational component and and then

1028
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:59,440
once once we determine based on

1029
00:47:56,409 --> 00:48:02,108
standards how well we can do then we'll

1030
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,400
be able to provide a better idea of the

1031
00:48:02,108 --> 00:48:08,949
breadth of testing that can be

1032
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:12,070
and actually they'll actually also be a

1033
00:48:08,949 --> 00:48:14,230
protocol for exactly how the samples are

1034
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:16,660
collected in the field for that testing

1035
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:19,240
and our protocol will be identical to

1036
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:23,639
that that egg and market diseases and I

1037
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:26,439
know team are working I know with

1038
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:29,799
wodsworth the program wodsworth we had a

1039
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:32,860
conversation with Chris smart here how

1040
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:35,260
to achieve a consistency well we have

1041
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,910
participated and going to other person

1042
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:40,230
country to see how the sample should be

1043
00:48:36,909 --> 00:48:42,730
taken once that protocol is determined

1044
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:45,670
we will then be doing outreach to our

1045
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:52,070
force inspectors few keyboard inspectors

1046
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:54,619
that will be responsible for you know

1047
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:56,600
thanks Chris you have any expectations

1048
00:48:54,619 --> 00:49:02,989
at the federal level for the next round

1049
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:04,339
oh no I mean I think it's on our you

1050
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:06,109
know we've on our radar see it's

1051
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:08,480
definitely stuff I don't want put words

1052
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:11,630
in anyone's mouth but Thanksgiving to

1053
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,610
Governors we're very aware of this issue

1054
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:14,990
and we understand these agree to

1055
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:18,680
foot-in-the-door the Marbella with

1056
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:21,829
industrial hats out but there is a bill

1057
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:25,129
introduced in Congress now to relax some

1058
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:27,230
of the regulations right you know that

1059
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:28,970
may be big enough but the whole thing

1060
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,490
we're working under doesn't sunset at

1061
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:40,659
the 2014 right it doesn't have to be

1062
00:49:31,489 --> 00:49:42,679
reauthorized or does it affect that

1063
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:45,469
we're just starting I mean we're

1064
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:47,449
starting to look at as a whole as an

1065
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:49,609
agency at a farm bill is starting to

1066
00:49:47,449 --> 00:49:53,239
have discussions and it's an expression

1067
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:56,690
for everyone but here in folks Oh point

1068
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:58,699
person on I would guess on federal farm

1069
00:49:56,690 --> 00:50:02,409
bill who I worked closely with us in the

1070
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:05,449
commissioner's office would be a farmer

1071
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:07,969
so what we would love to do now is that

1072
00:50:05,449 --> 00:50:11,059
everyone to sort of go out and wanted to

1073
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:14,119
