1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:15,080
University so the topic of this uh

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,519
presentation will be surface ceiling and

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:22,198
uh their effect on the echology of dry

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:24,359
dry areas and as Jeff said this is

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,080
basically sums up my

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,160
PhD h and a bit from my master uh

8
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,479
studies

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,000
so if I would ask people what they know

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,319
about surface

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,399
seating the majority of people would say

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,719
well they cause flash floods in dry

13
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:45,079
climate so last week we had Becky's talk

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,960
about flash floods in the Northeast but

15
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,399
they also happen a lot in the um drier

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,039
areas and surface sitting are one of the

17
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:58,600
leading cause for that and unfortunately

18
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,800
they cause damage the FL the floods

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,198
cause damage to property

20
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:07,679
sometimes even take lives and basically

21
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:11,280
a lot of times it's a management

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,200
problem but surface seing is also a

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,640
mechanism which mobilizes water in

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,759
environment where water is the most

25
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:23,359
limiting factor and up until now the

26
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,599
ecological role of surface seing has not

27
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,200
H been fully explored and this is what

28
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,118
I'm going to talk

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,320
about so the setting for this present

30
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:36,200
ation is half a world

31
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:38,359
away um Mediterranean this is the the

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,240
coast of

33
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:43,000
Israel some of

34
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,478
Lebanon Syria

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,519
Jordan and I'm going to take you to the

36
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,239
south of Israel can you see the cursor

37
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,798
yeah over

38
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:55,438
there

39
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,360
and the research site that we worked on

40
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:01,639
is next to the Village of

41
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:05,478
Rahat um and leim two Villages and we

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:09,038
worked all this area where is it here

43
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:11,959
all this Hills here below the forest H

44
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,119
with the study site and how it looks

45
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,319
from the

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,640
ground basically like this we have a

47
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:22,679
rolling heels with a woody vegetation

48
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,359
patches of Woody vegetation and in a

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,959
diffused

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,280
pattern and if you look closely and just

51
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,560
another view here you see that

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,000
surrounding all these patches are bare

53
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,319
areas okay so bare

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,840
soil and if you have a closer look even

55
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:46,079
you can see so you have a a patch a

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:50,878
shrub here and it's surrounded by

57
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,640
Bare H soil so bare soil in this areas

58
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,239
is usually sealed so it might be sealed

59
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,479
by physical surface

60
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,400
ceiling H or biogenic surface ceiling

61
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:04,079
and a lot of times it's also both of

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,640
them so on this talk today I'm going to

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,760
focus only about physical surface

64
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,399
seiling and not about

65
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,679
biogenic another closer look you can see

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,360
it's quite visible you see the skin on

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,560
the surface and uh it's it's quite

68
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,159
common in those area so how does

69
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,840
structural structural surface seiling Ur

70
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:31,798
it's created by the impact of raindrops

71
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,840
on the exposed soil Aggregates and those

72
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,519
Aggregates break depending on the

73
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,560
rainfall kinetic

74
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:43,560
energy and some of this

75
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,319
H aggregate breakup just flows with the

76
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,840
with the runoff but some of it

77
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,560
infiltrates and carries with its fine

78
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,598
particles okay so those fine particles

79
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,479
slowly increase the bulk density of the

80
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:59,119
Disturbed soil layer and at the end you

81
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:02,039
have a layer which its thickness could

82
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,640
reach up to to 3 to 4 cm it's much

83
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,560
larger or much uh the thickness is much

84
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,078
bigger than what usually people think

85
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,840
it's not only the skin the visible skin

86
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,840
on the surface it can uh reach much

87
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,478
deeper so surface cing has been the

88
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:26,039
topic of research studies for probably

89
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:28,079
70 years now um and 60 years and most of

90
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,639
those early Works have focused on

91
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,079
different aspects of surface ceiling

92
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,720
and those Works were mainly empirical

93
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:40,478
you had runoff plots you

94
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,919
had lab experiments and over the last 20

95
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,800
years there's been increased attention

96
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:48,279
and efforts to develop the mathematical

97
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,079
models of SE the seal hydraulic

98
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:55,839
parameters and mostly led by Shu assulin

99
00:04:52,079 --> 00:05:00,359
which was one of the um instructors on

100
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:02,839
this PhD uh work and when you have the

101
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,600
mathematical models you can then start

102
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,839
to implement surface ceiling into

103
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,400
hydrological models either either

104
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,079
different scale so it can be a heel

105
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:14,679
slope or a waterers shed but you need to

106
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:19,279
have the mathematical

107
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:22,519
model a few words about ER surface seing

108
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:25,198
okay the C layer bulk

109
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:28,959
density ER is a a function of the

110
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,919
underlying so H soil so here you have

111
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,638
you see the cursor here this is the row

112
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,079
of the crust the row of the C layer is a

113
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,439
function of the original soil the

114
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:43,519
underlying soil below below him and

115
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:49,038
another Delta so this Delta depends on

116
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:53,478
soil type for a less soil is 0.4 cm and

117
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:55,599
it decays on a exponential rate and it

118
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,879
basically looks like this here on the X

119
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,520
you have the difference in bulk density

120
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:02,600
on the Y you have the uh thickness or

121
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,038
the depth of the soil of the ca layer

122
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,120
excuse me so this difference is

123
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:11,079
maximized here on the surface of the

124
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,959
soil of the C layer at 0.4 and then it

125
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:17,560
slowly decays until it converges with

126
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:20,000
the underlying soil for this graph here

127
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,959
at a depth of 2

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,038
cm so another prominent effect of the C

129
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:30,279
layer is of course on the hydraulic

130
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:33,120
conductivity of the soil again the C

131
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,439
connectivity stems or directly from the

132
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,918
underlying soil the connectivity of the

133
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:42,639
soil and I will not go into all these

134
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:45,560
parameters but what it basically does it

135
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,800
reduced the the inter connectivity is

136
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,199
highly reduced and just to demonstrate

137
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,639
this this is a a rama less

138
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,960
soil so on the bottom you have the

139
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,079
hydraulic conductivity versus the the

140
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:02,839
head or the soil potential and

141
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,240
a the bottom graph is for the soil and

142
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,839
the upper one is for the ca layer and

143
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,639
this is the same okay this is the soil

144
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,799
and this is the resulting C layer from

145
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,478
the soil so uh if you just as you can

146
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,879
look at a k side or the maximum hdra

147
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:23,159
connectivity for the soil is around

148
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:25,800
3.3 cm/ hour and the respective C layer

149
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,199
hydraulic connectivity is around

150
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,360
0.06 so the C layer is about 1 or 2%

151
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,759
of the underlying so the conductivity

152
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,160
it's a huge contrast in

153
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:42,520
infiltration and that has of course uh

154
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:46,400
um a remarkable effect on the

155
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:49,158
hology and C layer is sometimes

156
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:52,318
perceived as a desertification agent

157
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:57,120
there's a highly cited paper with over I

158
00:07:52,319 --> 00:08:00,240
think it's 160 citations now which place

159
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,478
um surface ceiling as an agent which

160
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,560
accelerates

161
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:08,399
desertification

162
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:12,199
and there's also a few studies more

163
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:16,638
recently that show that a c layer has

164
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:20,520
also some positive effects on a the

165
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:25,280
Ecology of dry land this is the work of

166
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:28,680
Ivanov at Al which used a runoff model

167
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,359
uh and he showed that uh surface ceiling

168
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,479
if you account for ceiling you have

169
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,278
higher annual

170
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:40,240
primary primary production on the lower

171
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:44,639
topography on the

172
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:49,839
Wes and another work which is actually a

173
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:53,519
side project of my PhD we develop this a

174
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,440
runoff model and this is a a plot this

175
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,919
is a run of plot on the left you can see

176
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,000
the topography so this is high and this

177
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,078
is low and and basically the water is

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,240
Flowing down from top to bottom and on

179
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:07,278
the right you see patches of vegetation

180
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,039
on this run of

181
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:14,039
plot and just for the size so you have

182
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:17,879
the perspective this is four M wide by I

183
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:20,439
think it was yeah 18 m a

184
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:24,559
length and this is what the cumulative

185
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,920
infiltration looks after 51 mm of a

186
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,799
storm

187
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:32,278
so what you can see the blue patches

188
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,958
here of cost of vegetation and the

189
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:38,519
legend is the cumulative infiltration in

190
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:44,078
meters so if you see for example here

191
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:47,560
it's a blue patch has roughly a

192
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:51,958
around 20

193
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:55,479
0.28 of a meter which is about four or

194
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:58,759
five times of the a rainfall amount if

195
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,440
you go even further down the slow the

196
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,799
Run of lot here this is a patch which

197
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,480
receives probably 10 m of contributing

198
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:09,559
area and cumulative infiltration can

199
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,800
reach half a meter so it's like 10 times

200
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:15,679
more of natural rainfall and that's a

201
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:18,799
huge amount for vegetation in dry land

202
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:22,958
CU water is their limiting factor and

203
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:24,359
and this is basically places ceiling

204
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,919
it's what the literature called a

205
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,440
non-local control on the soil water

206
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:32,199
content and the vegetation water avail a

207
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,360
ability so the water available for the

208
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:39,320
vegetation here results from water

209
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:43,200
accumulating Upstream not in

210
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,360
C2 but there is also uh another aspect

211
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,399
for surface ceiling which was rarely

212
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,959
addressed in that you know the lower

213
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,278
permeability the lower hydraulic

214
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:56,638
connectivity also affects evaporation

215
00:10:53,278 --> 00:11:00,399
rates not only infiltration and here you

216
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:03,600
see a work um 40 years ago Bressler and

217
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,200
camper so they wetted two soil columns

218
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,399
one by rainfall and one by flooding and

219
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,600
they measured a cumulative evaporation

220
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,120
over time and you can see that for the

221
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,759
rain treatment which resulted in

222
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:22,000
crusting and ceiling on the top is has

223
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:24,120
lower evaporation over time and this

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,320
effect was mainly

225
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,078
disregarded so it's possible that a CER

226
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,240
also has what they call a local control

227
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:34,638
in C2 by affecting the evaporation rates

228
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,959
but this was not studied so the research

229
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:41,480
gaps for today's uh presentation what is

230
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:46,119
the c layer local control on soil water

231
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:49,240
content and what is that effect on

232
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,240
vegetation water

233
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:55,639
availability the steel so the steel

234
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,480
layer is a CR right the same yeah yeah

235
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,240
so in the literature sometimes they call

236
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,800
it crusting some sometimes they call it

237
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,919
ceiling crusting is more H usually

238
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:09,439
associated with the biogenic crusting

239
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,439
but it's it's basically

240
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,278
similar okay so this research questions

241
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,919
were addressed using two operational

242
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:23,720
steps first we developed a a 1D bare

243
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:25,599
soil hit slop scale model accounting

244
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,720
explicitly for surface ceiling so this

245
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,800
is a simple model we neglect neglect

246
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,639
vegetation

247
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:35,919
and it's a 1D model so we don't have

248
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,919
runoff and we don't have subsurface

249
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,560
flowing the Second Step was to develop a

250
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,959
2d model which does account for of

251
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,479
course surface ceiling and also

252
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,000
vegetation water uptake so we include

253
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,600
vegetation into the

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,039
model and the study site as I said

255
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,759
before was next to La which chose a hill

256
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:04,759
slope the semi the climate is semiarid

257
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:07,439
close to 300 mm per year and it has a

258
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,559
distinguished wet and dry season so all

259
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,959
rain falls during the

260
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:18,439
winter and the summer is hot and dry the

261
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:25,319
soils at the study St are brown LOLs and

262
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:28,680
less and we uh our model had 3x3 M

263
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:31,680
resolution so it's basically a vector of

264
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:36,399
of a fet of cells over this hill slope

265
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:40,439
and we characterize each cell with an

266
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:43,759
extensive soil database so what we

267
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:48,720
collected we had the soil depth measured

268
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:53,120
in 550 location at this hill slope and

269
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,879
basically taking a 5 kilogram hammer and

270
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,000
placing this metal wedge and it's it's

271
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:02,039
quite painful and done that 5 50 times

272
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,360
with a crew of helpers of course not by

273
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:08,039
myself and then I interpolated it into a

274
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,240
continuous layer so I

275
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:15,838
can assign the the soy dep to the

276
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:18,399
respective model cell we had soy tecture

277
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,320
collected at 60 location at the hill

278
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:25,078
slope and analyzed for the texture and

279
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,440
that Ena us to do uh continuous layers

280
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:32,359
of the sand the silt and the clay

281
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:36,120
content uh all in in geost statistics in

282
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:39,480
cing h we had a DM which was measured on

283
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,720
the site I used a total station to

284
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,680
record the height of the um Hill slope

285
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,360
in 700 what's that 30 point uh points

286
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:52,120
all along the seill slope and that after

287
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,800
interpolation led to a 20

288
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:59,720
cm DM which is relatively high

289
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,159
resolution and once you have the DM you

290
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,680
can calculate the radiation for each

291
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:09,679
cell and the inclination of the cell I

292
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:12,519
further used a classification high high

293
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,399
resolution classification to extract the

294
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,879
percentage of the rock out crops in each

295
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,039
model cell and I corrected the the water

296
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:23,120
availability for the soil in the

297
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:25,599
remaining in the the remaining soil in

298
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,318
that cell

299
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,879
um some factor which we corrected so as

300
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:32,838
I said before vegetation is not

301
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,519
accounted subsurface flow is not

302
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,040
accounted for and run runoff is not

303
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,839
accounted so all of this database was

304
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,519
fed into hydros 1D I don't know if

305
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:46,880
you're familiar with hydros or not

306
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:50,078
hydros is a numeric subsurface flow

307
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,159
software and we had two cases we had

308
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,758
either a

309
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:58,039
sealed H cell or an unsealed cell so if

310
00:15:54,759 --> 00:16:00,360
we had a sealed case we applied the m in

311
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:04,639
a in equation

312
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,680
from the WRR 1989 paper and we developed

313
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,120
the Matlab code which basically

314
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:13,838
automates this a a model throughout

315
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:17,799
these entire cells and ending with uh

316
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:20,319
possible to predict or model Theta the

317
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:23,559
volumetric water quent in every location

318
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:26,519
at the seill slope or any depth that you

319
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:29,439
want a few words about the hydros this

320
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:34,360
is how those independent cells

321
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:38,399
a look at the Hydra 1D software so this

322
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:42,079
is the the soil column and if for the

323
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:46,759
sealed case we had also a 2 cm seal

324
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:48,439
layer here which is characterized by the

325
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,278
the soil parameters of the alen line

326
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,079
soil okay so each one each cell was

327
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,799
related directly the C layer to the soil

328
00:16:54,078 --> 00:17:00,198
in

329
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:03,799
itself H Hydra solves numerically the

330
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:06,399
equation and which I brought here but I

331
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:08,438
will not go over it it uses the water

332
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,000
retention of both the soil and the Sea

333
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:14,480
layer and it's a very widespread uh

334
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,359
hydrological software hydros as of I

335
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,199
checked last month there was 1300 papers

336
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:23,000
which have used hydros since the late

337
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,798
'90s and all of them are available at

338
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,839
the company website it's a very

339
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:34,679
versatile tool it's a very strong tool

340
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:37,359
so every model needs to be validated so

341
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,480
we've done it in 82 Hill slop locations

342
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:43,240
before and after every rainfall event of

343
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,640
the 2010 2011 rainfall

344
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:50,000
season 87 water content measurements

345
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:54,360
each one is a average of three replicas

346
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,960
so basically I took to the lab to uh

347
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,479
it's a gravimetric water content

348
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,480
sampling okay so I took the soil and

349
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,880
wait it and plac in the oven for two

350
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,558
days and then waited again and basically

351
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,919
close to 2500 soil samples which I took

352
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:13,798
from this um Hill

353
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:18,200
slope and this is the

354
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:21,839
result so quite a bit of scattering okay

355
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,360
you can get the model to work any model

356
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:27,079
I guess you can get it to work

357
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,959
sometime uh or even most of the time but

358
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:32,119
you can't really get it to work all of

359
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,840
the time any model that you do and over

360
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:37,000
here on the y- AIS you have the

361
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,119
simulated soil uh water content versus

362
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,079
the

363
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:44,839
measured and we can see two ranges here

364
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,879
so all these measurements here which has

365
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:49,199
higher water content they were all

366
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,760
sampled right after the rainfall event

367
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,919
okay so during that time H the soil

368
00:18:52,759 --> 00:19:00,279
moisture variability is is high and the

369
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:03,799
model it was harder for him to get it

370
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:06,440
right but still if you look at the

371
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:10,679
overall accuracy and the efficiency you

372
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,798
have a n suit Cliff efficiency of 0.7 so

373
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,679
the model

374
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:18,279
works but uh still a lot of scattering

375
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,919
if you look at the lower soil water

376
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:23,319
content measurements you can see here

377
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:26,159
the C layer of course measurements are

378
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:29,240
in the blue and the unal are the

379
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:32,000
red and what you see that if you do not

380
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,679
account for sealing in your model you

381
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,319
basically underestimate soil moisture

382
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,880
measured at the field okay and you can

383
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:41,480
see it quite clearly

384
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,679
here

385
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:48,200
and we wanted to further explore this so

386
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:52,320
this is just an averaging of all those

387
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,960
um measurements in time so on the Y the

388
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:58,720
water content and on the x is the

389
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,600
simulation time the black circles are

390
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,159
the measure data the the average measure

391
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,399
data of the Hill slope and the green is

392
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,240
the sealed case and the brown is the

393
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,360
unsealed one and as I said before you

394
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:15,319
can see that during the the drying

395
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:20,119
intervals between the rainfall events uh

396
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:23,839
basically an unsealed soil dries quickly

397
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:26,599
and underestimates what measured at the

398
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:30,720
field and and what happens is that

399
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:33,918
during the evaporate the uh the drying

400
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,440
interval the C layer reduces also the

401
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,280
evaporation from the soil and basically

402
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:43,000
keeps higher water content below

403
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,759
it so I'm going to demonstrate it

404
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,440
through some model outputs this is uh on

405
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,359
the left you have the sealed heel slope

406
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,640
the sealed case on the right you have

407
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,558
the unsealed one and the water content

408
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,840
the legend of course you have the the

409
00:20:54,558 --> 00:21:00,000
warmer colors for dry and the blue

410
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,599
colors for wet

411
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,279
and here below you can see it's just an

412
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:09,319
extract from a season this is a 2006

413
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:12,319
season in laim and I just stop the model

414
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,558
in a right after a rainfall event and

415
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,639
I'm going to show what's happening when

416
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:21,440
you start the drying interval so as days

417
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:24,840
go by basically the

418
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,840
unsealed H soil dries much

419
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:30,720
faster and after a week or two

420
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:33,480
completely different water content map

421
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,480
on the hill

422
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:41,480
slope so we wanted to explore when is

423
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:45,079
this happening and why and we I'm going

424
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,120
to show three uh three slides the first

425
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:51,158
one is what happen if you have a 7 mm

426
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:53,359
rainfall event on the hill slope 7 mm

427
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:56,880
per hour so this intensity does not

428
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:59,839
generate runoff okay in the on our study

429
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,278
site and if you start the simulation

430
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:05,439
from the same initial water content you

431
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:08,119
can see the water content increases but

432
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,919
then it drops and it remains higher for

433
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,879
the sealed treatment the sealed case

434
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,440
here on the

435
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,320
blue and by the time the next rainfall

436
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,600
event arrives of course the C layer

437
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,439
because there's no runoff there's no

438
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:24,359
loss of water so the water content

439
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,759
increases H higher to to higher water

440
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,719
quent for the sealed case and it remains

441
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:32,960
higher so if you had only low intensity

442
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:36,400
rainfall event you basically have always

443
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,400
better conditions under a

444
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,200
sealed

445
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:44,000
conditions what happens if you have

446
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,319
stronger rainfalls so for on the top

447
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,599
figure you have a rainfall of 15 mm per

448
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:56,439
hour and this rainfall generated

449
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:58,678
20% of runoff so for the first days

450
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:02,000
after the rainfall event you can see

451
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:06,200
here the the blue excuse me the red

452
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,759
unsealed case has higher water content

453
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,480
okay so you have runoff lost for in the

454
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:14,038
sealed case water did not infiltrate and

455
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,839
as a result it has lower water content

456
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:20,440
but after a few days five days H for

457
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,480
example in this case this is reversed

458
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,960
and basically what a sealer does it

459
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,038
compensates for all this water lost by

460
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,000
runoff by reducing evaporation rates

461
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,798
during the drying intervals

462
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,759
and by the time the next rainfall event

463
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,879
arrives again the seal layer the sealed

464
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,558
system is favorable in terms of water

465
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,080
content and will remain favorable until

466
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,158
the end of the season but what happen if

467
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:49,918
you have a higher intensity rainfall

468
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:54,520
event let's say 24 mm per hour so this

469
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:59,400
rainfall uh event leads to 50 uh around

470
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:02,240
55% of uh runoff and for the given

471
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,200
drying interval here for a week the sea

472
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,640
layer there's so much water which is

473
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,840
lost to runoff so the sealed system just

474
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,759
remains drier until the next rainfall

475
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:13,240
event it cannot compensate for such a

476
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:18,038
large loss of

477
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:19,599
water and so it's it's a complex pattern

478
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:21,759
because every rainfall throughout the

479
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,918
season of course has its own intensity

480
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:29,038
and drying interval until the next

481
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:31,480
rainfall event and on the long term this

482
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:33,839
is the average of 32 years of simulation

483
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,200
for that study site you can see that the

484
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:40,079
C layer which is on

485
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,440
Blue has higher water content than the

486
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,798
unsealed one this these are all

487
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,038
individual cells 8,000 cells just

488
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:50,079
plotted here and what also is important

489
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:53,038
to notice that on the y- axis you have

490
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:55,599
the temporal standard deviation so this

491
00:24:53,038 --> 00:25:00,000
means how much does the soil must change

492
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:03,278
in time okay and um and what you can see

493
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,079
that the sealer not only has higher soil

494
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:09,240
soil water content in the sealed case it

495
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:11,359
also has lower standard deviation

496
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,240
temporal standard deviation so water

497
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,519
quantity is higher and it stays there

498
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,319
for a longer of time compared to an

499
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:21,599
unsealed case and this of

500
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:24,000
course can possibly have a large effect

501
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:28,158
on water availability for vegetation

502
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,519
which are surrounded by a ceiling and

503
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,159
the this is our next uh step this is the

504
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:34,440
next the second part of this

505
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,520
presentation so how does that affect

506
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,840
water

507
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:41,398
availability to address this we have

508
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:45,879
used uh a unique setting climatic

509
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:48,239
setting in Israel where over uh short

510
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:52,840
distance you have a sharp climatic

511
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:57,640
gradient over around 40 miles you have

512
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:59,199
200 mm climatic gradient so you can uh

513
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,320
basically

514
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,399
we have here free meteorological station

515
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:07,519
laav which was the the setting which I

516
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:11,239
showed before another middle one here

517
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:14,918
beeva and deer at the South so we use

518
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:18,359
data from free climatic from free

519
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:20,159
meterological station and another unique

520
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:22,839
setting is that all of the south of

521
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:27,278
Israel was exposed to aolon deposition

522
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:29,480
and the creation of less soil extensive

523
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:33,919
less soil so so basically we can use the

524
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:36,480
same soil type okay on all of these uh

525
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,960
analysis so that only thing that will

526
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,120
differ was the climatic condition so

527
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,720
that

528
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,719
uh made made it easier for the

529
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:55,399
analysis okay so back to the hydros

530
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:00,679
model and hydros this is the two 2D

531
00:26:55,398 --> 00:27:02,839
riches equation and the way in hydros or

532
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:06,559
the way the rich equation implement the

533
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:11,079
vegetation is by a sync term this s

534
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:13,158
here okay and what is this sync term you

535
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:16,038
have to Define it using a water optic

536
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,559
model the hydros offers you a few to

537
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:21,919
choose from the most common one is the

538
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:25,158
fedus water optic model and I will go

539
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,799
over it briefly so the S the sync term

540
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:29,559
is a function of alpha which is a

541
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:33,038
reduction coefficient I will explain it

542
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:35,678
in a second and which is multiplied by I

543
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,240
lost my cursor here here multiplied by

544
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,360
potential transpiration which you

545
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,880
assigned for the simulation and that

546
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,959
defines how much of that potential

547
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,440
transpiration is being taking like

548
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,519
transpired by the shrub or removed from

549
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,440
the simulation cell

550
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,960
okay so what is the in briefly what is

551
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,720
the fedus water optic model on the Y

552
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,480
here you have the reduction coefficient

553
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,240
it ranges from 0 to one one on the X

554
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,319
this is the water potential so this is

555
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:08,079
saturation here on the left and it goes

556
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:11,480
dries as uh you go further to the right

557
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,359
and under um saturated condition you

558
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,120
have

559
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:18,199
anoxic uh condition you have very

560
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:21,918
basically very little transpiration so

561
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,480
the reduction coefficient is minimum on

562
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,759
on high

563
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,558
saturation very quickly when the the

564
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:33,640
potential decreases and and you have a

565
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:37,200
drier soil um this becomes optimal and

566
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:40,440
it remains optimal until a point which

567
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,038
is defined a P2 point where it starts to

568
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,399
declines in this model it linearly

569
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:51,119
declines until it reaches to the point

570
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:54,558
of P3 which is um stops transpiration

571
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:57,839
that's like represent a witing point

572
00:28:54,558 --> 00:29:00,599
okay um and of course the location of

573
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:03,759
the potential the soil water content on

574
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:06,439
which P2 occurs and P3 occurs are

575
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,440
vegetation

576
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:14,480
specific so now we have a challenge if I

577
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,480
was to model corn I have a good life

578
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,399
it's very easy and it's a commercial

579
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,200
crop everyone or not everyone a lot of

580
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,639
people have studied it and you can just

581
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,080
pick up from the literature all the

582
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:28,120
parameters that you want and go on and

583
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:30,759
model it but if you want to model

584
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:34,199
natural vegetation or sarcopoterium

585
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:36,879
spinosum which is the the main shrub at

586
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,720
the study site it just not available

587
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,640
there is no you can't take corn and say

588
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,480
it's equivalent because it's not so we

589
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:48,278
had to um calibrate

590
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,599
and basically measure those

591
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:55,119
parameters and we did it using a lomer

592
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:58,079
experiment a small scale Li liom

593
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:01,678
experiment where we had the the shrub we

594
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:04,798
grew it in a hot house Screenhouse for a

595
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,240
year and we planted it in a buckets

596
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:11,759
where we know all the dry weight of each

597
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,278
component and we place it on high

598
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:18,480
resolution scales I don't know if you

599
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:21,440
can see it so this uh scales away the

600
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,880
weight of the bucket and since we know

601
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,558
all the dry weight of the other the

602
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,600
components all the difference stems from

603
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,759
soil moisture in this bucket

604
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:34,240
and you can

605
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:37,079
track um the the the Dynamics of water

606
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,640
content within each bucket but now we

607
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:40,599
have a problem okay so we went to the

608
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,559
study site and we brought soil from the

609
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:45,918
study site and we packed and we planted

610
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:49,480
the the the buckets the shrubs in the

611
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,480
buckets but once you take soil out of

612
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,159
your study site you interfere with all

613
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,639
these parameters and you basically

614
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,840
repack it in the in the in the bucket

615
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:01,719
and you don't know what now the soil

616
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:04,398
parameters are and the soil parameters

617
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,159
will affect the parameters which you

618
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:09,319
calibrate for the vegetation they all

619
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,080
interact with each other so we did did

620
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:14,879
it in a two-step procedure first we

621
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:17,599
calibrated only the soil parameters

622
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,639
which we packed in the same way and we

623
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:24,038
use that with a hydros

624
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:28,079
1D version an inverse calibration

625
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:32,359
procedure and um with a cumulative

626
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:34,199
oration as the objective and it's

627
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:38,959
basically quite a good

628
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,679
calibration um so now after we have that

629
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,798
we have the the soil parameters so we

630
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,798
can take them back into the more

631
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:48,798
complicated case of uh vegetation in the

632
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:50,158
bucket and calibrate the shrub water

633
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:52,839
optic

634
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,679
parameters H so again we did that using

635
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:58,480
hydros one day we had 15 different data

636
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,278
sets of a wedding and dry

637
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,159
and recalibrated the five fedus

638
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:07,240
reduction coefficient

639
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,840
parameters H I used a a Latin Hipp Cube

640
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:13,399
sampling approach which to generate 20

641
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:15,918
20,000 parameter sets which were used

642
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:17,319
for the calibration so we can H

643
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,320
calibrate in a high

644
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:20,319
resolution

645
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:25,278
way so these are the results on the top

646
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,000
you have the calibration range on the

647
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,880
bottom you have the resulting op theal

648
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,919
parameter set

649
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,679
H and on the bottom you have the

650
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:38,440
validation of this calibration which was

651
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:43,320
quite well so a note

652
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:46,399
here those P2 points the P2 value and

653
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:49,480
the P3 which Define the onset of stress

654
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:52,319
in this vegetation on and the witing

655
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,519
point these values here are the results

656
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:58,079
of the calibration assumptions that we

657
00:32:54,519 --> 00:33:01,720
made okay cuz we

658
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:05,278
ER the the the drying interval between

659
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,880
the the wetting events was the average

660
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:12,038
drying intervals was eight days between

661
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:14,760
each wetting event so that was the

662
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:17,839
average uh drying interval of the study

663
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:20,240
site that's why we chose that and this

664
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:25,398
P3 value which is

665
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:27,880
basically uh 1500 CM does not reflect

666
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:29,439
the actual stress in the of the shrub we

667
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,159
did not measure anything related to

668
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,159
stress we don't know if there's actually

669
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:36,240
onset of stress in the shrub but we do

670
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,000
know that that's the optimal solution

671
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,519
for the average conditions on on of this

672
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,440
vegetational study site and also we we

673
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:48,399
in the paper we show that um 90% of all

674
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,120
available water is consumed within this

675
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:54,119
eight days so most of the water of the

676
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:56,359
shrub is from the first eight days and

677
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:58,599
in reality in in the field it also can

678
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:02,038
extract water from cracks and the

679
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:03,678
underlying bedrock and and it has all

680
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:06,200
kind of mechanism which enable him to

681
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,919
survive under dry condition but most of

682
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,079
the water is been consumed in the first

683
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,039
few days of course after the rainfall

684
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:16,519
event was the objective function the

685
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:18,000
water content over time the cumulative

686
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:21,000
ER

687
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,239
ET the cumulative evapor transpiration

688
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:29,719
and we partition it between potential

689
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:29,719
evaporation and potential transpiration

690
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,800
okay so we took this parameters and this

691
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:43,838
is a hydros 2D transact H it's a the

692
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:47,079
blue layer represent the seal and the

693
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:50,759
Orange is a root Zone a uniform root

694
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:52,359
Zone which is surrounded by a c layer so

695
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,159
this is for the sealed case of course if

696
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:59,440
there is no seal for the unsealed one

697
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:02,000
just continous so there's no seal

698
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,679
and these are two points two observation

699
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,159
points which I will talk about in a few

700
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:12,799
slides and this is the boundary

701
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:17,879
conditions for the

702
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,640
simulation so I developed this H ratio

703
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,559
which I call the vegetation water optic

704
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:24,838
ratio which basically the cumulative

705
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:27,358
uptake for the sealed case over the

706
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:30,480
cumulative uptake for the unsealed one

707
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:32,239
so if it's higher than one the ca layer

708
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,000
is beneficial for vegetation if it's

709
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,719
lower than one it's a negative factor

710
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,599
and I've used 35 years of climate data

711
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:43,439
from in each of those stations some

712
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:47,000
station had 40 the Lev care site but

713
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,280
some less but overall few Decades of

714
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,519
climate data

715
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,640
and this is the

716
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:57,079
result so the line represent the one the

717
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,759
vegetation water optic value of one and

718
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:02,560
the vast majority of All

719
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,240
Seasons H surface ceiling is a positive

720
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:08,799
factor increasing vegetation water

721
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:12,078
uptake and the average is an increase of

722
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,519
26% okay so that's quite significant for

723
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,200
um of

724
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,480
course those vegetation or the the

725
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:19,719
Dryland

726
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,199
vegetation you can see that this effect

727
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:24,439
is not uniform across all station and

728
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:28,159
the black ones represent the weather the

729
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:31,240
semiarid site of laav H which the sea

730
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,759
layer doesn't have a a less effect as a

731
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:37,039
reduced effect and as the SE as the

732
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,760
station goes drier the sea layer effect

733
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:42,719
increases H and also the scattering

734
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,720
increases but you can reach for the

735
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:48,919
deare site a vegetation water uptake of

736
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:51,959
Closs to 50 and 60% so that's a huge

737
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,960
increase in

738
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,800
uptake and how is this happening I I

739
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,159
will explain that using the observation

740
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,359
points there within the root Zone we

741
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:05,000
have Point number one and just outside

742
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:06,880
the root Zone we have Point number two

743
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,920
and this is

744
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,160
uh the water content Rao means the the

745
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,920
water content of the sealed system over

746
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:17,598
the unsealed one if it's higher than one

747
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,519
water quantity is higher for the sealed

748
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,960
case and this is on the 1994 season at

749
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:26,199
theim site and you can see that during

750
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,599
the rainfall event here um okay so this

751
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:29,799
is the water quent ratio and this this

752
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,760
is the time and the black lines are the

753
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,599
rainfall event here so during these

754
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,599
rainfall events due to run of initiation

755
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:42,240
so water content is lower at a a sealed

756
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:44,240
case if The Rao is lower than one but as

757
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:48,118
the drying interval

758
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:49,838
proceeds um the water cont Rao is higher

759
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,720
for the seal case and it's much higher

760
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,358
for Point number two which is outside of

761
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:57,759
the root Zone and it's close to 20%

762
00:37:54,358 --> 00:38:01,039
higher so this is what drives the water

763
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,599
content uh uptake of the shrub of has a

764
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:06,480
higher water

765
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,800
availability another interesting

766
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,480
observation is that the relation between

767
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,800
the Surface ceiling and the annual

768
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:19,079
rainfall amount is non unique so in this

769
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:22,839
a dotted rectangular shape which

770
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,640
I ER draw here you can see that for the

771
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:27,039
same seasonal rainfall amount you can

772
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:28,519
have multiple Solutions of vegetation

773
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,838
water

774
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:33,719
so what's happening here and and what's

775
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:36,119
happening that uh within season rainfall

776
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:39,199
characteristic are highly important and

777
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:42,960
they actually drive the water content

778
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:45,879
uptake and the vegetation water uptake

779
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,519
Rao and I'm going to demonstrate it here

780
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:52,160
here you have

781
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:54,159
a a low initial water condition this

782
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,358
Theta of

783
00:38:54,159 --> 00:39:00,598
0.2 and you have two rainfall

784
00:38:56,358 --> 00:39:04,799
intensities one is 6 mm quite low and

785
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:10,838
one is 24 mm quite High per

786
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:12,680
hour and what you get is for this low

787
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:15,159
water content initial water content

788
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:18,919
condition you have so much runoff

789
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:21,960
generated that basically the C layer is

790
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,639
negative it has vegetation water uptic

791
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,159
right you're lower than one and it stays

792
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:27,920
lower than one even if you have a

793
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,118
prolonged drying interval

794
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,599
but if you have you do the same exercise

795
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,800
it's same simulation you just started

796
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:38,280
from a higher water content initial

797
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,519
condition so at the beginning of of the

798
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,760
simulation because of the Run of water

799
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:45,400
content and vegetation water uptake is

800
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:48,560
lower for the sealed case but after a

801
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,480
few days it starts to increase so it

802
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,199
also depends on the initial water

803
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,719
content condition on the rainfall

804
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:58,919
intensity and on the drying interval so

805
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:01,480
this is one storm and over an average

806
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,280
season in our study site we have roughly

807
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,599
13 storms so in each one of those the

808
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:11,560
sealer can either be a positive a

809
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:13,599
negative and and this accumulative ER

810
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:16,759
effect leads to this non-uniqueness that

811
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,760
we seen in the previous

812
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,639
graph so

813
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:24,118
I close

814
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:27,318
to finalizing this

815
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:31,838
presentation the we wanted to also prove

816
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:35,279
or show that uh these results uh are

817
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:39,078
applicable on different C thicknesses in

818
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,599
reality the C thickness is dependent on

819
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:44,519
the rainfall energy the rainfall kinetic

820
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:47,119
the soil organic matter the soil type

821
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:49,000
within the same heel slop it can vary

822
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,440
and it actually varies on the field the

823
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:56,000
thickness so we repeated this analysis

824
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,720
for different soil a c layer thickness

825
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,838
and what we basically see that it's

826
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:04,118
enough to have uh half a centimeter of a

827
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:08,719
CA layer to have a significant effect on

828
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:11,480
vegetation water uptake and and

829
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,959
basically of course if you have a higher

830
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:17,079
seal thickness a larger field thickness

831
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:20,318
that the effect increases so basically

832
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:23,318
it's applicable across different CER

833
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:23,318
thicknesses

834
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,599
conclusions surface ceiling okay is

835
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:30,960
responsible for floods they cause

836
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:34,119
property damage

837
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,000
and might be a negative factor but it

838
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:40,000
also has an essential role and the

839
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,719
delicate Ecology of dry

840
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,039
climates this effect it varies between

841
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,759
storms between soil

842
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,639
properties but overall under most

843
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,240
conditions surface ceiling is a positive

844
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:55,318
local control it increases the soil

845
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,919
water content and its persistence over

846
00:41:55,318 --> 00:42:01,039
time this increased water availability

847
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,079
leads to higher vegetation water uptake

848
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:08,920
which increases on the long run

849
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:11,640
vegetation resilience in those uh dry

850
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,838
climates so we've seen the Seer has both

851
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:17,159
a non-local control on vegetation and a

852
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:20,480
local control and that places it as a

853
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:23,838
key player in the eatology of dry

854
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,400
climates where water is the limiting

855
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:31,358
factor thank you
