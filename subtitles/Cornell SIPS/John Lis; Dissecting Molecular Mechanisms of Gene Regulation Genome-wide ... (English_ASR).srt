1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:07,380
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:08,939
University thank you see a very generous

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:14,160
introduction and thank you all for

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:19,379
coming it's great so over the decades

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,448
I've been astounded repeatedly by the

6
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,099
discoveries that reveal layers of

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,910
sophisticated mechanisms that have

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,539
evolved to regulate transcription of our

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:34,799
genomes the transcription needs to be

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:39,840
orchestrated at our 20,000 or so mRNA

11
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:42,839
encoding genes but also at the tRNAs the

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,309
ribosomal RNA genes the long non-coding

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,050
RNAs the divergent transcripts that we

14
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:52,679
now know are associated with many

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:56,128
promoters and enhancers regulatory

16
00:00:52,679 --> 00:01:00,539
enhancers this pattern of transcription

17
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:04,039
is not static in cells but responds to a

18
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,269
spectrum of signals including those

19
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:08,849
developmental signals that take us from

20
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:13,048
a fertilized egg to an adult or a seed

21
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:16,528
to a plant signals that occur in

22
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:19,079
response to changes in nutrition or the

23
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:25,739
environment and of course changes that

24
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:28,528
occur in response to disease so this

25
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,839
regulatory specificity relies very

26
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:37,129
heavily on a large number of short DNA

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:40,499
sequence elements that interact with

28
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:42,179
hundreds of factors transcription

29
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:45,358
factors protein factors either directly

30
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:50,189
or indirectly and some of these sequence

31
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:52,259
elements reside in this region very

32
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:54,028
close to where the gene begins

33
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,909
transcription starts called core

34
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:59,548
promoter these elements interact with a

35
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,819
set of general transcription factors

36
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,349
that direct polymerase to the point a

37
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:08,819
proper point of initiation

38
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:11,280
additionally there are elements that

39
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,739
reside further upstream and provide a

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,830
chemical complement for the binding

41
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,740
of regular other regulatory factors

42
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,410
these elements and the factors can

43
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:27,150
sometimes be in large clusters that can

44
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:30,120
reside large distances from the position

45
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,039
of the of the gene

46
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,710
sometimes in over a million bases away

47
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:37,650
and still influence the transcription at

48
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,629
the gene target rather dramatically

49
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,200
now it's was thought initially if these

50
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:44,849
regulatory factors might affect the

51
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,259
recruitment or the activation of

52
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:48,329
polymerase directly by direct

53
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:50,519
interactions but more often than not we

54
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,370
now know that there are Co regulators

55
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,950
often multi subunit complex --is that

56
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,430
that the regulatory factors interact

57
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:01,049
with be they nearby or at enhancers

58
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:04,950
these come in several flavors some of

59
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:07,530
those types of of Co regulatory factors

60
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,569
are the mediator which is xx some

61
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,210
subunit complex that were different

62
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:14,340
factors and plug in their other subunits

63
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,590
then interact with the polymerase itself

64
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,229
there are hats histone acetyl

65
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,450
transferases modified chromatin there

66
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:25,439
are remodelers that can push nucleosomes

67
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:27,389
around and and so the lot of these

68
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,359
subunits are part of co-regulators not

69
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,289
only influenced polymerase in its

70
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,790
activity the recruitment of polymerase

71
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:37,979
and its activity but they can also

72
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:39,509
influence the chromatin structure making

73
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,669
it a better or worse place for

74
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:45,000
transcription and finally there are

75
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,589
insulators these mysterious still

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,530
mysterious components that restrict

77
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,200
where enhancers broadcast their signal

78
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,539
to you don't want genes activated

79
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,810
willy-nilly and the insulator helps

80
00:03:54,539 --> 00:04:00,449
prevent activation of improper genes and

81
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:05,159
also I think helps direct the enhancer

82
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:08,129
to its proper target so in addition to

83
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,719
well to understand regulation and how it

84
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:11,549
works mechanistically we meet each and

85
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,770
all of these elements and factors and

86
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,930
their into play but we also need to know

87
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,970
what steps in the transcription cycle of

88
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,608
rate-limiting well what are the slow

89
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,820
steps that are accelerated by regulatory

90
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:26,459
signals and there are multiple points in

91
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:27,599
the transcription cycle from chromatin

92
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:29,549
opening to the

93
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,430
initiation complex formation initiation

94
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,259
promoter proximal pausing release from

95
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,449
pausing productive elongation

96
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,519
termination and finally the recycling of

97
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:41,339
the polymerase to another round of

98
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:45,419
transcription and their transcription

99
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:47,609
factors associated with the DNA near you

100
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,250
know either nearby or enhancers that can

101
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,040
influence this process and influence any

102
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,540
of these steps in principle although it

103
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,310
seems like the early steps in

104
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,189
transcription are where what primarily

105
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,319
regulated we over the years became

106
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:04,560
fascinated or something some would argue

107
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:07,589
obsessed with with this phenomenon of

108
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,129
promoter proximal pausing which happen

109
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:12,359
later than what textbooks tell you

110
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:17,550
regulation where regulation should be

111
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,560
happening and and it involves after

112
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:23,040
polymerase initiates we find that

113
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,889
polymerase has moved to a few tens of

114
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,640
bases to a pause site and can hang out

115
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:32,370
there for some period of time getting a

116
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:37,289
proper signal then the polymerase can be

117
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:39,540
released into productive elongation okay

118
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,890
so let me just blow that area up a

119
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,660
little bit you can just see it a little

120
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,279
more clearly here there are there's

121
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,490
pausing taking place where there are

122
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,500
specific factors involved thirteen

123
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,540
complexes know from the SIF that help

124
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,160
stabilize the pause there's probably

125
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,840
interactions between a polymerase and

126
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,000
the general transcription factors that

127
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,389
brought the polymerase there that

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,930
probably we think keep the polymerase

129
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:05,849
from is from from readily leaving locus

130
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,939
and helping to stabilize the boss and

131
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:11,220
finally there's probably some component

132
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,980
of regulation at some of the pause sites

133
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:18,090
there you do the barrier caused by

134
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:20,700
nucleosomes so upon activation of genes

135
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:24,659
we we have other you know factors that

136
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:26,610
can bring in a kinase was rather famous

137
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,380
kinase they're rather a lot of major

138
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,759
changes that take place but one of the

139
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,459
most significant changes is the

140
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,349
recruitment of a PT FB kinase which can

141
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:38,189
phosphorylate these pausing factors and

142
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,350
the polymerase itself causing no to

143
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,759
leave the SIF to be transformed to an

144
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,350
elongation factor and

145
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,269
polymerase now to change its

146
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,370
modification state he can then take on a

147
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:51,359
new entourage or factors that help it

148
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:53,129
with its movement through these vast

149
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,040
distances through the genes and

150
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:58,079
chromatin but also coordinate the

151
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:03,390
transcription with Koch inscriptional

152
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:05,639
RNA processing ok so shortly after

153
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:09,930
arriving at Cornell back in the Dark

154
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:12,930
Ages and 78 I started dreaming about

155
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:17,340
ways of dissecting how eukaryotic

156
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:19,560
mechanisms working and and and I thought

157
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,179
it would be worth looking in the natural

158
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,889
context many people were doing a strict

159
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,949
biochemical approach money well I was in

160
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:28,919
a biochemistry section that really like

161
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:32,579
pure proteins and I was come work on

162
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:36,090
dirty also methodologies and do AI do

163
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:37,919
biochemistry but I thought this would

164
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,209
complement the traditional biochemical

165
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,830
approaches where people were purified

166
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,209
all the components involved in

167
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:44,699
transcription and then trying to

168
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:49,969
reconstruct the process in a test tube

169
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:52,949
and so over the years our laboratory has

170
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:57,180
emphasized an embarrassingly simple

171
00:07:52,949 --> 00:08:00,740
strategy it's simple-minded approach of

172
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,329
simply taking live cells observing them

173
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:08,100
perturbing them and then reabsorbing

174
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:09,509
them ok and in our reasoning is that you

175
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,610
can look at genes and genomes and

176
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:13,709
transcription factors and the polymerase

177
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,470
the machine of transcription itself and

178
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:18,329
the nucleosomes if we could look at

179
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,270
these at the highest possible resolution

180
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:22,109
both spatial and temporal we might be

181
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:24,000
able to learn something about

182
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,949
transcription and how it works at least

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,470
put some limits on models that we're

184
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:31,259
considering and then we can perturb the

185
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:34,320
this process either by turning on or

186
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,509
pressing genes and response of specific

187
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,220
signals but we could also make mutants

188
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:40,349
and transcription factors and do RNA i

189
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,168
or drugs that inhibit particular

190
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,940
components RNA aptamers that might

191
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:47,129
interfere with macro molecular actions

192
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,040
or use of de grande to get rid of

193
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:52,740
proteins and thereby perturb the process

194
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,120
in a very specific way and then reabsorb

195
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,529
as soon as possible after the

196
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,090
perturbation to

197
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,009
see what the immediate effect the

198
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,320
first-order effect of these

199
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:03,600
perturbations are now we can't always do

200
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,250
them these essays immediately after with

201
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,129
a lot of these perturbations but some of

202
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,870
them you can't so the outline of the

203
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:13,259
talk today is that we went try and cover

204
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,970
the key chock as a model system and we

205
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,220
start off an optical view it'll be easy

206
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,830
to easy to take I think for most people

207
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,899
it's it's always nice to have movies and

208
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,850
pictures promoter proximal pausing is

209
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,879
the second part you'll see this is a

210
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,340
critical step in expression Drosophila

211
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,850
melons very broadly a critical step and

212
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,649
finally we'll do a genome-wide analysis

213
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,080
of transcription regulatory mechanisms

214
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:41,939
and for safa but also mouse and human

215
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,830
and and drill down a little bit in terms

216
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,730
of mechanism

217
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:49,830
okay so heat shock response so we picked

218
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,440
the Drosophila system as a model I

219
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:57,150
picked this early on going Dave hug

220
00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:00,240
misses lab it was the reasons where the

221
00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:02,669
genes are robustly activated many genes

222
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,350
over you know induced 200 fold you can

223
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:09,059
be a sloppy biochemist and still get a

224
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:11,550
decent result the response is rapid

225
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:13,379
happens within tens of seconds it's a

226
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:16,229
synchronous activation so you can watch

227
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,689
things as they as they happen as

228
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,879
function of time and see as factors get

229
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,040
recruited and machinery goes through the

230
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,470
gene and that set certain limits on to

231
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,299
what those factors might be doing the

232
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,430
principles and underlying mechanisms are

233
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:31,049
proving to be be general much more

234
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,449
general than I expected and finally Paul

235
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:36,509
Dean chromosomes of flies and certain

236
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,400
tissues provide a unique amplified

237
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,870
signal and resolution to look at the

238
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,220
chromosomes and look at active

239
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:45,690
transcription as it's happening so the

240
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,190
heat shock response we've learned a lot

241
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:51,839
about this in in unand deuced cells

242
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,640
you'll see evidence that this polymerase

243
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,250
already present on the unenthused

244
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:59,519
promoter not on the gene body but on the

245
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,529
promoter is of work from the honda lab

246
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,889
shows that this drift is know from D si

247
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:06,360
F associated with the stabilizing that

248
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:07,949
paused polymerase the general

249
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,419
transcription factors there there's a

250
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,030
Gaga factor that we

251
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:14,399
you'll hear more about there's a master

252
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:15,720
regulatory protein factor that doesn't

253
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,199
associate very strongly with the

254
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,139
unenthused gene or edit seat rock

255
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,680
elements but upon heat shock it trimer

256
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:29,129
eise's and binds very tightly to the to

257
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:32,159
the activated jeans or enhancers that

258
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:35,100
are nearby the genes and this recruits

259
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,959
the PT FB kinase which then allows this

260
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,970
pause polymerase now to escape very

261
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,800
rapidly once every six seconds so that

262
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,870
polymer aces are stacked on the gene

263
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,569
about as tightly as they could go in

264
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,700
response to each other so that's the

265
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:51,270
model and let me just start by going

266
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:55,170
through an optical observation of how

267
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:56,759
this how these genes operate this was

268
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:59,750
facilitated as I mentioned because of

269
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:03,840
polity in chromosomes these chromosomes

270
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:08,580
in these in the salivary glands these

271
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:10,320
chromosomes are I've undergone many 10

272
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,180
rounds of duplication so now we have a

273
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,940
thousand chromatids and they remain

274
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:17,669
aligned in an interphase extended state

275
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,130
and they take on structure that we can

276
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:22,110
see here with bands and into bands very

277
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:23,850
characteristic you can know where you

278
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,250
are on the chromosome what low sign

279
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,590
genes in the LX to and they cut these

280
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,740
chromosomes come from these salivary

281
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:33,690
gland cells that when we break open the

282
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,310
cells and spread the chromosomes you now

283
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,570
have these dead chromosomes that you can

284
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:39,269
look at which have been very valuable

285
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,220
here's a mitotic chromosome on their

286
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:44,970
same scale so you can see these are

287
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,980
really giant wonderful structures that

288
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,529
was fascinated by these immensely when I

289
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:55,830
started working in Drosophila I stole

290
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:58,519
him actually and and so in a

291
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:01,170
collaboration with watt Webb's group

292
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,929
number of you may remember his great

293
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:07,289
contributions to optical science here in

294
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:10,769
Cornell we had a joint student Jay G

295
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:12,990
Yahoo we decided it would be interesting

296
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:14,399
to take a look at the the polycon

297
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,500
chromosomes using two photon laser

298
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,629
scanning microscopy a technology they

299
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,250
had working and it and later on that

300
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:23,338
week he came back with these pictures of

301
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,490
obstacle sections taken every half

302
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:28,560
half microns sections through uh

303
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,818
salivary gland and we could see going

304
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,508
from one end to the other you get this

305
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:35,219
fantastic view and notice that you could

306
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:36,539
map begin mapping particularly

307
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,889
chromosomal sites even in this

308
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:39,599
three-dimensional structure so this

309
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,318
optical sectioning approach worked

310
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,420
pretty nicely

311
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:46,229
you could identify specific loci which

312
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:48,120
meant that you could in principle track

313
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:51,480
the recruitment and dynamics and

314
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,459
interactions of proteins like gfp-tagged

315
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,339
proteins that specific native lo site in

316
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:58,799
real time in living cells and the

317
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,870
operation can be done with lasers this

318
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,479
two-photon laser scanning but we can

319
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:06,179
also get a comparable results and faster

320
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:11,490
with a spinning a state-of-the-art finit

321
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:15,899
spinning disk microscope and so Katie so

322
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:17,850
back and and Buckley went down and

323
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,100
collected a lot of data of this sort and

324
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,800
and what we use in this is we have to

325
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,930
match lenses one at twenty two degrees

326
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:28,139
one one at thirty seven the Heat's on

327
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:30,750
temperature and and you can then make a

328
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:33,058
variety of transgenic fly lines we made

329
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,808
a variety of lines that have GFP and RFP

330
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:39,299
tag transcription factors and and looked

331
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:41,669
at the various combinations so first at

332
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,889
22 degrees you take optical stacks of

333
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:46,349
the green and red channels to get two

334
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:48,509
proteins map simultaneously and then you

335
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:52,069
can shift the lenses and he capacitor

336
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:52,068
via winds is such that we know from

337
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:59,610
direct measurements that the salivary

338
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:01,139
gland increases temperature in about six

339
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,688
seconds so you can begin immediately

340
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:08,480
taking watching the time course gene

341
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:11,278
activation caused by this warm lens that

342
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,528
activates gene expression so let me just

343
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,919
show you a set of movies that are

344
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:20,639
synchronized here that have we can watch

345
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,990
each arc factor Paul - Pete FB kinase

346
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,539
the famous kinase I mentioned to you

347
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,549
elongation factor SPD six and a

348
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:29,338
topoisomerase one all of which get

349
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,838
recruited upon each are two major heat

350
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,699
shock low site we're gonna follow a

351
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:36,389
couple of major heat shock laws are the

352
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:37,199
ones that have the hsp70 genes there and

353
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:39,240
so let me start the

354
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:47,879
movie and then let's stop it really

355
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:50,129
quickly yeah so here is the view at 18

356
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,899
seconds so there's already a signal that

357
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,450
begins showing up with the master

358
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,039
regulatory protein heat shock factor so

359
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,590
it's it's not there at the beginning

360
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:01,860
right or very low at the beginning but

361
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,720
upon heat shock it gets recruited

362
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,289
saturates with about in about two

363
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,830
minutes

364
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:11,309
then Paul too starts coming in and then

365
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,810
along with PTFE kinase and then these of

366
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:14,549
thirty elongation factors he has just

367
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:16,979
plotted out the results from many many

368
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:18,569
nuclei and actually multiple salivary

369
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,279
glands showing the standard error so

370
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,950
it's a highly reproducible highly

371
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:25,279
synchronized process hsf saturates by

372
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:28,500
two minutes followed by polymerase and

373
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:32,399
PTFE than the other factors and so from

374
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:35,190
this kind of analysis we know that the

375
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,439
activation is different nuclei and

376
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,690
polythene cells a synchronous hsf is

377
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,970
rapidly recruited to heat shock low-side

378
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:45,180
within 20 seconds and saturates by two

379
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:48,000
minutes and then it's followed by this

380
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:49,529
paul ii and PTFE kinase and finally this

381
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,580
shows that transcription factors are

382
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:55,289
assembled on these heat shock genes

383
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,780
rather than heat shock genes being

384
00:16:55,289 --> 00:17:00,839
transported to some factory as a some

385
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,610
models profess that you move genes

386
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,059
around to places that are transcribed

387
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,578
instead we think at least in these

388
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:14,970
systems that that you assemble the

389
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:16,649
factory at the side of the gene so part

390
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,529
two here we're going to investigate

391
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,449
promoter proximal pausing okay and we'll

392
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:23,430
start by examining the very early

393
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:25,680
evidence biochemical evidence for

394
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:30,810
pausing that got me into this got our

395
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:32,640
lab into this problem of studying this

396
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:38,099
type of transcriptional control that was

397
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:40,050
not appreciated at the time so the first

398
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,519
experiments that led us to the idea i'm

399
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:43,919
gonna go over for experiments extremely

400
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,710
quickly so you can they're published a

401
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,840
long time ago so there it's want to read

402
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,038
more about it please do but

403
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,379
we just give you the essence of these

404
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:54,569
experiments there's a UV chimp

405
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,940
experiment this is a cross-linking

406
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:59,058
immuno precipitation was worked by Dave

407
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,808
Gilmour was actually the first of these

408
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:02,970
cross-linking new precipitation

409
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:05,129
experiments later became chip

410
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,500
experiments and chip seek and other

411
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,480
things but this was a precursor of those

412
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,019
kinds of experiments than Bartkowski

413
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,548
adopted adapted it told us we looked

414
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:16,619
decided to look at RNA polymerase itself

415
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:17,668
before and after heat shock waves we

416
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:19,709
thought that'd be a good way to develop

417
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:21,840
this technology before he chart

418
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,329
polymerase covered the entire gene but

419
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:27,079
in the unenthused gene polymerase was

420
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:30,298
also given a signal and by doing

421
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:32,339
restriction digestion and look probing

422
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:33,599
the DNA that copra CIPA tates when we

423
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,480
have two cross-linking and Amira

424
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,609
precipitation we're able to pinpoint

425
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,250
that polymerase to between minus 12 and

426
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:42,719
plus 65 it was right at the start and at

427
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,788
high concentrations we estimated one

428
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,350
polymerase per gene what's the status of

429
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:48,509
that plumbers could simply be bound to

430
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:51,209
the promoter no nuclear went on

431
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:55,169
experiments done by an rugby showed that

432
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:57,538
that you could block new initiation with

433
00:18:55,169 --> 00:19:00,000
high concentrations of salt or a soccer

434
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:02,429
seal and and release this polymerase

435
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,869
into into elongation and a nuclear run

436
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:05,610
on experiments you can make that

437
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:08,428
polymerase move and incorporate

438
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:10,319
radioactive nucleotides and those and we

439
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:13,259
could see that those polymerases map to

440
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,658
this same region precisely where they

441
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:18,058
map was map but was done by Eric

442
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:21,090
Rasmussen where he fished out these RNAs

443
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:23,548
and sized them and then finally we

444
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:27,298
checked in vivo by completely orthogonal

445
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:29,970
method using permanganate that's

446
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:32,278
impregnate which Maps single-stranded

447
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,429
T's in these bubbles and we could see

448
00:19:32,278 --> 00:19:37,259
that there were hypersensitive T's

449
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:40,048
associated with the promoter region even

450
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:42,210
in non heat shock cells and so all of

451
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:45,569
this data points to this Klem race in

452
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:48,329
this model I've shown here has engaged

453
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:51,269
in transcription made a short RNA of 20

454
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:55,619
to 50 nucleotides depending on the gene

455
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:57,898
and it's and it's caused and it can be

456
00:19:55,619 --> 00:20:01,739
made to transcribe in the presence of

457
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:02,639
Sarkis island or high salt that removes

458
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,529
some of the we

459
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:12,120
extract some of the barriers that keep

460
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:19,019
it boss so so these targeted studies in

461
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:21,839
in the 80s and 90s were kind of ignored

462
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:23,970
I would say in early stages and that was

463
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,309
because the the field was focused on

464
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,200
yeast as a model system in transcription

465
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,369
which does not show posny and we've gone

466
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,980
back with some of our genome-wide

467
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:32,879
methods now and show the east

468
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:38,309
sacrifices of his hair does not show

469
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:41,160
concept but in the mid 2000s with 2000

470
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:42,809
around 2005 we were developing for some

471
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,340
very sophisticated people were

472
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:46,589
developing sophisticated genome-wide

473
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:49,319
methods from that being polymerase chip

474
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:52,339
chip experiments were being done where

475
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:55,109
you could chromatin IP and then probe

476
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:58,589
these microarrays to cover the genome

477
00:20:55,109 --> 00:21:00,449
and an experiment and some of those

478
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:02,909
techniques basically we'll see were

479
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:06,809
replaced by more sophisticated

480
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:08,279
observation methodologies and one of the

481
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:12,029
early experiments by being rendered on

482
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:13,879
in a human lung fibroblast line IMR 90

483
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:16,470
showed that a ribosomal protein gene

484
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,060
that there was plum races piled up on

485
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,980
the promoter now this is a gene that you

486
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:22,289
theoretically I mean that we knew is

487
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,799
expressed and so these these reads in

488
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:27,899
the in the gene body were real and but

489
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,909
we were I mean I most people were

490
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,259
surprised that there would be so much

491
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,870
polymerase sort of piled up on the

492
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:35,849
promoter if they were simply

493
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:38,009
transcribing this gene and but this was

494
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:40,469
blue reminiscent of the paused

495
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:42,269
polymerase we saw in hsp70 except was

496
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,569
centered right at the start site rather

497
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:48,259
than being displaced downstream and a

498
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:51,569
number of other labs were also able to

499
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:53,309
see these this pilot polymerase on

500
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:57,349
various promoters and various systems in

501
00:21:53,309 --> 00:22:01,109
drosophila and and in other human cells

502
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:04,109
work from rick young's lab karen Adelman

503
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:06,839
and Mike Levine and so we wondered if we

504
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:09,809
could evaluate whether this polymerase

505
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:13,470
was a pre initiation complex that is

506
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:15,089
simply bound or was it paused and and in

507
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,470
the original papers it was interpreted

508
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:18,119
to be a pre initiation

509
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,390
Lex but we wondered if we could

510
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:23,609
contribute to this process of of

511
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:26,009
characterizing these genies polymerizes

512
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:27,449
on promoters genome-wide by developing a

513
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:30,269
new method leighton core who is a

514
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:33,590
extremely talented read student at the

515
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:35,548
time decided to take on this project of

516
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:38,369
developing something that we now call

517
00:22:35,548 --> 00:22:41,129
grow seek global run on sequencing and

518
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:43,379
and the idea is simple you know you if

519
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,390
you isolate nuclei you have polymerases

520
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,700
on genes or some of them at the pause

521
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:49,320
site some of them on the gene body the

522
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,240
idea is to let those polymerase is run

523
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:53,700
on in the presence of nucleotides in

524
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,339
particular a nucleotide that has an

525
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,860
affinity tag like bromo UTP there are

526
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:00,808
antibodies to bromo UTP that you can use

527
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:03,959
them to fish out what we call the

528
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:07,408
nascent RNA so you'll run on you get

529
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:10,259
these bromo use incorporated and then

530
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:13,049
you control run on hundred bases you can

531
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:14,730
then isolate the RNA base hydrolyze that

532
00:23:13,048 --> 00:23:17,279
down to a hundred bases so that you can

533
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:21,000
map precisely where the polymerase was

534
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:23,129
and this is followed by you know these

535
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,619
affinity purification x' at each step of

536
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,690
the library preparation there are three

537
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:29,699
purifications and spike in controls tell

538
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:31,710
us that this is about nearly a million

539
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,009
fold purification of the nascent RNA so

540
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:37,798
it's very clean source of mapping where

541
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:39,658
polymerase is precisely and make a

542
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:41,038
library and then you sequence heavily

543
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:43,350
and so this was off first

544
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:46,140
look at this remembered this arriving

545
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:49,500
one night or one afternoon and it was a

546
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,990
disk full of things on a disk and we

547
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,429
were trying to figure out what how to

548
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,960
count again look at what what this was

549
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,450
telling us by the end of the night

550
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,909
fortunately had a Josh waterfall here

551
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:01,169
was a physicist who could handle this

552
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:02,549
kind of thing and by the end of the

553
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:05,130
night we had these browser shots we were

554
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:08,429
very very excited and here's the pattern

555
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:10,350
of transcription of genes you can see

556
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:12,960
genes going left to right are shown in

557
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:14,490
red right left or in blue we can see

558
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,850
this pattern over this two point five

559
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:20,370
mega base region you see the genes stand

560
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:22,619
out very nicely and we could get a

561
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:25,678
close-up view by expanding this little

562
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:28,769
region here and we can take a look at a

563
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,670
single gene and we did this in welding

564
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:33,119
fiber blast

565
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:35,490
experiment that being rended will the

566
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,529
same cell line that building ren used

567
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:41,039
and his bing Ren's data showing the chip

568
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:42,629
chip results here's the the grow seek

569
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,299
results and we can see that that is a

570
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,620
striking peak of pause bloomer eyes just

571
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:49,019
downstream from the transcription start

572
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:50,579
there's another pause going in the

573
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:52,920
opposite direction that surprised us

574
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:54,539
it's turned out to be general polymerase

575
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,250
is going the other direction the sum of

576
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:58,139
the two gives us polymerase that's

577
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,640
centered in the transcription start so

578
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,880
it didn't look like it was paused in

579
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:06,230
this case but indeed it's caused in both

580
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,850
directions home race and so this was a

581
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:12,690
surprising feature of the architecture

582
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:14,819
of mammalian promoters and indeed its

583
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:17,370
general we can see and there's meta gene

584
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:21,059
analysis were lining up genes left to

585
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:22,259
right here and we in you can see in the

586
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:25,559
red direction we're looking at the

587
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:27,990
transcription of the gene there's on

588
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,480
average very striking pausing taking

589
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,609
place this is gene body levels and we

590
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,920
see this upstream anti sense

591
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:37,740
transcription even if we remove any

592
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:41,670
upstream genes and this is just a

593
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:44,009
feature of promoters so a majority of

594
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:47,279
polymer area promoters show pause paul

595
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:49,259
ii in both directions and we also looked

596
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,319
in drosophila and we see a similar

597
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:55,039
pausing going on striking pause genes

598
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:58,769
here some genes don't show pausing but

599
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:01,170
the majority of greater than seventy

600
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:04,109
percent of genes show some significant

601
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:06,500
causing in drosophila there isn't

602
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:08,490
divergent transcription at promoters

603
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,079
drosophila is a little smarter than we

604
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:14,970
are i think and they may send polymerase

605
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:16,559
in the correct direction we can talk

606
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:21,690
about at the end if you're interested

607
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:24,569
how flies are so smart okay so just to

608
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:26,100
reiterate what these these patterns are

609
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:27,629
so if this green is the density of

610
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:31,589
polymerase we see that there's a pile of

611
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,790
polymerase at this cause site so way we

612
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:35,039
interpret that is there there are

613
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:36,720
factors that's recruit the polymerase

614
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,240
with this big arrow showing with

615
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,220
recruitment sufficient the release and

616
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,750
productive elongation is less efficient

617
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,940
the small green arrow and

618
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,740
we have a pileup of polymerizes here and

619
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,830
what there is some gene body level that

620
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,170
we you can detect and then when a gene

621
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:55,649
is activated maybe new factors bind and

622
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:59,250
bring in this PGP kinase and allow them

623
00:26:55,650 --> 00:27:01,410
the increased escape release into

624
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:06,930
productive elongation and this gene body

625
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:08,190
level can go up now we were curious and

626
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,700
I should I should add that there are

627
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:13,529
these very specific inhibitors to the

628
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,420
kindness ptb kindness and we were

629
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:19,769
interested in you know what fraction of

630
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:25,350
the genes are are dependent upon this PT

631
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:29,099
FB kinase this cause and release step

632
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:32,759
and so IRA's Yorkers in Mouse ES cells

633
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:37,980
then decided to add this p JP kinase

634
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:39,869
inhibitor and and and look at what how

635
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,819
the pattern is the normal pattern of the

636
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:44,759
gene what would happen if we now block

637
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:46,619
this with flavored peridot how will it

638
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,900
change this pattern of transcription we

639
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:51,089
see here we're looking just reads in the

640
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,570
know flavored period all case there's a

641
00:27:51,089 --> 00:28:00,449
pileup of polymerases each one of these

642
00:27:54,569 --> 00:28:02,369
lines represents a separate gene you can

643
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,250
see the pile up of polymerase is in both

644
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:07,679
directions and upon flavor at all

645
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,630
treatment we if we block the release we

646
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,150
should see the gene body go down the

647
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,490
pausing perhaps go up and indeed this is

648
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,710
what she saw if we look at compare the

649
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,829
50 minutes relative to know flavored

650
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:22,710
period all the change that happens

651
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:25,259
here's a log 10 scale here we can see

652
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:28,680
that gene body goes down dramatically on

653
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:31,980
all genes and was pausing goes up on

654
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,650
most cheese and the same is true for the

655
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,720
anti sense orientation and here's just

656
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,660
an example gene this gene we wouldn't

657
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,039
call as paused because it not obvious

658
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,320
but when you add flavor pyridyl and

659
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,359
watch with time you can see that the

660
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:47,700
clip the transcribing polymerase is

661
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,829
clear and they clear in this wave you

662
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,630
can actually measure that rate of that

663
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:54,980
wave movement and get elongation rates

664
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:56,410
4,000 genes at a time by this method and

665
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,599
in bow

666
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:01,210
we can now see that this gene piles up

667
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:05,379
polymerase at the pause site so and in

668
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:08,019
fact you know virtually written 95% of

669
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,940
genes behave in this way where they have

670
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:10,750
to be going through this they seem to be

671
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,799
going through this

672
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:17,319
pause release step even if the pause

673
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:21,069
isn't detectable so this is a general

674
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:22,539
mechanism okay seclusions for r2 is most

675
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:23,950
mammalian drosophila genes exhibit

676
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:26,379
promoter proximal palsy and all active

677
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:29,410
genes undergo will pause release that is

678
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:33,460
dependent on this peach FB kinase the

679
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:39,090
last section we'll go through are you

680
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:46,090
with me are you hanging in there okay

681
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:48,039
fasten your seat belts so we want to now

682
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:51,339
look at because what can we learn from

683
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:56,470
this beyond what I've just told you and

684
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:58,359
so Fabiana Duarte decided to extend this

685
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:01,600
and Chris awful looking more broadly at

686
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:03,969
the heat shock response and to do this

687
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:06,819
we we also made use of a technology that

688
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:12,269
was developed by a rotating grad student

689
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:16,809
is now professor here hojun quack where

690
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:18,639
he took gross leak and made it and

691
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:20,230
provide a base pair resolution developed

692
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,330
it to a base pair resolution so

693
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:26,650
precision run on sequencing or pro seek

694
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:28,539
the way this works is that we

695
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,430
incorporate a instead of a bromo you a

696
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:32,589
biotin NDP and that chokes the

697
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,180
polymerase let me just back up let me

698
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:36,069
just back sorry let me just back off a

699
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,110
little bit oh okay we're already there

700
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:39,309
so what happens is the biotin gets

701
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:41,259
incorporated in that chokes to

702
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:43,240
polymerize basically if you're only

703
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:45,220
buying two nucleotides present you had

704
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,170
one by it and so that marks the three

705
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,049
prime end of where polymerase was and

706
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,570
then you can put linkers on and and in

707
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:55,059
sequence and that as you sequence from

708
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:56,710
the three prime end you get the the base

709
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:58,659
pair precision where the active site of

710
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:04,900
polymerase is density of polymerase

711
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:06,610
genome-wide genome-wide and procede

712
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,530
features are very much like grow seek in

713
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:10,149
and I'll just reiterate these that we

714
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:12,009
can get a distribution of

715
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:14,170
scription regret engaged our a

716
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:16,720
polymerase route the genome he's bride

717
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,700
kinetics snapshots that are not affected

718
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,769
by the background of the accumulated

719
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,660
mRNA one can measure gene expression by

720
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:24,609
mRNA but if you want to see changes that

721
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,560
happen you have to wait for those pools

722
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:28,419
to change and instead you can look

723
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,679
directly right at the gene and see what

724
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:34,120
happens in a minute or two by these

725
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:36,370
methods to assess the the changes that

726
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:38,529
are either up or down in regulation

727
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:40,929
it's the strand-specific assay it's

728
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:44,289
highly sensitive there's a dynamic range

729
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:48,009
of nearly six orders of magnitude its

730
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:49,089
base pair pro seek now differs from grow

731
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:51,400
seeking that its base pair resolution

732
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:52,869
and it's more robust than easier so if

733
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,180
any of you have tried grow seek and you

734
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,559
said I'll never try this again try Pro

735
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,380
seek and there'll be newer methods

736
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,619
coming out that we're promising will be

737
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:05,560
a half-day protocol don't don't hold me

738
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:12,869
to half date but that's that's what some

739
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:17,319
of former students arguing okay so so

740
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:19,149
the hope was that by using Pro seek it's

741
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:20,980
high resolution and sensitivity could

742
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,280
provide a very fine grained panna

743
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,450
panorama of the changes in transcription

744
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,910
across the genome in response to

745
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:30,519
regulatory signals allowing insights

746
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:32,050
into the steps in transcription that are

747
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,809
regulated so we wanted to look at heat

748
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:36,759
shock genes and he chart response and

749
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:39,339
watch the whole genome as it changes

750
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:41,710
right and so we did took Asafa Lascelles

751
00:32:39,339 --> 00:32:44,319
cell cultures did a heat shock and then

752
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,269
took samples at 30 seconds 2 minutes 5

753
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:49,960
minutes 10 minutes 20 minutes and then

754
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:52,000
did prosy replicates we did replicates

755
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,340
of course and this was work Fabiana door

756
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,119
duarte with some help my gerton we see

757
00:32:54,339 --> 00:33:01,240
these good high correlations between

758
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:03,609
replicates we can then begin looking at

759
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,400
the difference between the the zero time

760
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:08,229
point to non heat shock in the various

761
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,080
time points here to see when differences

762
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,700
significantly occur and we can see that

763
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:14,500
by 5 minutes there are some differences

764
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,840
that begin to occur by 20 minutes weeks

765
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,299
have many hundreds of genes in pink here

766
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:22,779
that are activated many thousands of

767
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:23,259
genes that are down regulated and here's

768
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:26,680
just

769
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:29,140
examples of the kinetics changes and we

770
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,580
see this increased transcription within

771
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,400
the course of this 20 minutes on the

772
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:35,049
upregulated gene you see with comparable

773
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,030
kinetics a down regulation of

774
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:47,019
transcription on those genes that are

775
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:49,149
turned down and now so the major heat

776
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:52,089
shock genes that we were all interested

777
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:54,640
in shall show pausing and and and we

778
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:56,740
find that the level of pausing is

779
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,780
generally high on the heat shock

780
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,819
activated genes so we were wondering

781
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:02,889
what is what are the factors that cause

782
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:05,919
that pausing to set up the pause begin

783
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:07,690
with and one of the factors that jumped

784
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,940
out at us was gah-gah factor which we

785
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:14,940
had previously previously shown was

786
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:22,840
associated with activated genes as did

787
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:25,059
lien lab in gilmore lab and but it was

788
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,730
not only and was rich certainly on HSB

789
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:29,619
70 but it was also rich on other paused

790
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,570
genes generally and when we look at

791
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:33,339
where gah-gah factor is on the heat

792
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,679
shock activated genes we do this

793
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:39,309
analysis as a where do we find a gaga

794
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,648
factor binding site bye-bye Gaga factor

795
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:43,389
chip signals that is the real binding

796
00:34:41,648 --> 00:34:44,859
sites where does it whether they occur

797
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:47,260
relative to the transcription start well

798
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:49,628
they occur be largely before the first

799
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:55,260
hundred bases upstream and so we see

800
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:58,029
that this 70 percent of the genes have

801
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,220
Gaga factor associated with them of the

802
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:02,080
activated genes and we have to go much

803
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:04,869
further out to find them in the case of

804
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,719
repressed or unchanged genes if we look

805
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:09,880
by just a meta gene analysis where the

806
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:11,679
Gaga factor is and how abundant it is in

807
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,780
these various classes we see on the

808
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:16,210
activated genes its high and just

809
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,730
upstream from the transcription start so

810
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:21,369
75 percent of the activated genes seem

811
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:23,260
to have this Gaga factor bound but is

812
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:25,569
this related to Gaga factors role in

813
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,640
causing and each honk activation the

814
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:30,640
test that more directly we did a one of

815
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:33,400
these perturbations where we cabana did

816
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:36,219
a Gaga factor RNA I compared it to a

817
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,059
control lac Z plus and minus heat shock

818
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:40,209
and then did pros

819
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:42,250
in all samples and the knock down those

820
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:46,539
deep work that's shown by this

821
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:49,000
quantitative Western and and we can get

822
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:51,759
different classes of genes out to I want

823
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,239
to focus on is the is this red class

824
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,780
where we see we look at the gaga factor

825
00:35:55,239 --> 00:36:02,679
the lack Z our nai ratio on the gene

826
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:05,680
body that is where has Gaga factor

827
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:08,440
knockdown led to a decrease in gene body

828
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:11,799
transcription you see that in red and

829
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:15,099
these are genes that are show decays

830
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,900
transcription but also show also have

831
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:19,630
Gaga factors associated with the

832
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:22,240
promoter however there is a purple class

833
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:24,400
where Gaga factor is bound but there is

834
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:27,189
but these genes these act each arc

835
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,220
activated genes don't show any decrease

836
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,780
they don't care about gaga factor and so

837
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:33,459
we have these two distinct classes those

838
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,560
that care about gaga factor for

839
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,090
expression there those that don't and we

840
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:40,090
can now look at how is that related to

841
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:41,440
the pausing that's caused upon gaga

842
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,590
factor knocked down if we take these

843
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,679
gaga factor dependent heat shock

844
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:57,820
inducible genes shown in red here we can

845
00:36:47,679 --> 00:37:00,460
see that we can see that there's that

846
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:05,050
that in the gaga factor RNA i knocked

847
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:07,240
down we we have a decrease in in pausing

848
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:10,060
dramatic speakers opposing if we look at

849
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:12,459
this other class the purple class upon

850
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:15,969
gaga factor knockdown there's no change

851
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:19,000
in pausing so and we can see this in

852
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:20,859
browser shots as well here's a case we

853
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,949
have the control we see the pause

854
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:27,099
polymerase gaga factor knocked down we

855
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:29,199
lose the paused polymerase control we

856
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:31,449
see gene activation upon on heat shock

857
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:34,869
but we failed to see that heat shock

858
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:37,389
activation and so GAF is needed for

859
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:40,119
activation on those genes where gaga

860
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:41,980
factors also needed for palsy and and

861
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:44,639
there's this independent class where

862
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,960
gaga factors now we're pausing nor

863
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,000
transcription depends on on gaga factor

864
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,470
so something else must be substituting

865
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,760
for that

866
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:54,219
but let's first deal with how Gaga

867
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,670
Factor is working there was a studies in

868
00:37:54,219 --> 00:38:02,949
the past by Carl whoo that showed that

869
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:05,079
there were associations of Gaga factor

870
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:06,279
with a remodeler a nucleosome remodeler

871
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:09,760
which made some sense

872
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,619
so that remodel is called nerf so the

873
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,079
idea being that maybe Gaga factor

874
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:16,900
interacts with nerf and that clears open

875
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:20,140
a promoter allowing polymerizes to enter

876
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:22,740
at this very early step to create the

877
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:25,598
recruited polymerase and the pause site

878
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:28,838
consistent with that recent studies by

879
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:32,619
by Julius Judd a new student and the lab

880
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:35,078
has shown that by Chip seek or a related

881
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:39,039
version of that assay called cut and run

882
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:41,470
we can map polymerase on genes and we

883
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,969
can see where the Gaga factors located

884
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:46,959
and we can see then where that nerf

885
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:50,699
tends to co-localize with with that so

886
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:54,010
consistent with the model we find nerf

887
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:55,838
localizing with Gaga factor in Devo we

888
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:58,900
then tested the effects of a gaga factor

889
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:02,920
knockdown genome-wide on nucleosomes

890
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:04,960
are we clearing nucleosomes with Gaga

891
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,420
factor and if we knock down Gaga factor

892
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,608
we see nucleosomes filling in and so to

893
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,818
do that we can map where nucleosomes are

894
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:14,799
with this enzyme called microcon plays

895
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:16,960
digests the way the DNA that isn't

896
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,720
protected by the nucleosome and if we

897
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,568
know take that DNA and do paired-end

898
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:24,159
sequences from each side we can get the

899
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:26,619
position of where every nuclear zone is

900
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:28,440
in the genome and it does get a measure

901
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:30,970
of nucleosome occupancy

902
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,179
well nucleosomes are tend to be depleted

903
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:36,669
at promoters and you see that in two

904
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:39,789
classes this is the control knockdown

905
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,858
with lack just a lag see where we see

906
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:45,159
those that show reduce pose at pausing

907
00:39:41,858 --> 00:39:46,838
still have this open promoter those that

908
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:49,588
are unaffected by the gaga factor

909
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:52,539
knockdown are also behaving similarly

910
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:56,889
but if we now knockdown Gaga factor what

911
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:59,349
happens is nucleosomes fill-in they fill

912
00:39:56,889 --> 00:40:02,289
in over

913
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:05,349
the promoter region so Gaga factor seems

914
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:06,730
to be needed to keep this region free of

915
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:10,269
nucleosomes so in the model

916
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:12,880
here's we have factors we have this open

917
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:14,679
promoter Gaga factor nerf opened the

918
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,280
promoter allowing polymerase to create

919
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:21,759
the paused polymerase bond heat shock we

920
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:25,780
now have the polymerase firing OHS f1

921
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,810
binds brings in we think PTFE kinase

922
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:31,390
allow the nopd epi kinda allows the

923
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:33,789
firing of polymerase and we get a full

924
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:36,009
response in the gaga Frank the depletion

925
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:37,989
we blocked the process in an early step

926
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:40,600
in that nucleosomes can fill in on these

927
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:42,969
promoters block formation applause bloom

928
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:46,900
rice and these genes are no longer

929
00:40:42,969 --> 00:40:48,759
activatable now that i mentioned that

930
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,800
there are promoters that are independent

931
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,170
that are good gaga factor independent of

932
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,240
causing and they show association with

933
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:57,670
the second factor m1 VP they've been

934
00:40:55,239 --> 00:41:02,649
characterized by Dave Gilmour and and

935
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:05,470
indeed the enemies are dependent on m1

936
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:07,539
VP for both causing and heat shock

937
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:10,049
activation so there are two different

938
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:13,929
proteins that can set up the pause and

939
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:16,600
and and and act as we think to allow

940
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:17,949
than the activation so why pause you

941
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:22,839
might ask and what's what's all this

942
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:26,049
wasted effort yeah one reason is we

943
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:28,900
think is Gaga factor while it helps keep

944
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:31,180
nucleosomes off a polymerase is a great

945
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,510
foot in the door of chromatin keeping

946
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:36,489
this region open and indeed Karen

947
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:39,340
needleman's lab has found that the

948
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:41,079
polymerase itself if you disrupt it you

949
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:47,500
can see nucleosomes filling in on many

950
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:49,090
promoters as well and and this keeping

951
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,010
this open may be very critical in early

952
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:53,260
development especially in flies we know

953
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:55,180
where genes are turned on very very

954
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,260
rapidly in very specific stages and

955
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,969
Levine

956
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:01,810
Mike Levine has shown very nicely that

957
00:41:57,969 --> 00:42:04,629
this is very important and it's very and

958
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:07,690
all these genes that prescribes this

959
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:10,450
early embryonic development showed

960
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:13,579
striking pausing and and require that

961
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:16,098
pausing for their effect

962
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:18,980
and another reason I think we have

963
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:21,970
pausing is is because it gives us two

964
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:25,250
steps which to regulate gene expression

965
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:26,868
so we have this Gaga factor working at

966
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,659
this first step allowing the recruitment

967
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:32,088
by opening up the chromatin and once

968
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:34,129
polymerase is is recruited we know it

969
00:42:32,088 --> 00:42:36,049
moves very quickly to the pause site we

970
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:40,099
don't see initiation being rate limiting

971
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:42,530
and and then a second factor heat shock

972
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,730
factor we postulate then has the ability

973
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:46,069
we know it has the ability to bring in

974
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:48,650
PT FB and that influences the second

975
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:51,469
step of pause escape

976
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:53,030
pause release so we causes the

977
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:55,838
phosphorylation of these components and

978
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:58,130
now polymerase can release this gives us

979
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:01,250
two different factors that can can

980
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:03,230
operate in a synergistic way on on an

981
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:05,750
event that certain advantages getting

982
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,909
high dynamic range but also a way of

983
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,530
interpreting regulatory signals and

984
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:12,409
integrating those signals to give a

985
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:14,150
specific kind of response so I think

986
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:17,118
that's why you might be having factors

987
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:19,608
working at distinct stages but is hsf

988
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:29,240
one really working at this stage and so

989
00:43:19,608 --> 00:43:31,730
we've examined HSF the dependent he th

990
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:34,039
are activated genes looking at their

991
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:37,130
response in a controlled knockdown Lexy

992
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:39,559
we see before he chunk we get this

993
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:41,660
pattern and after he chart this set of

994
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:43,670
genes shows on average this increase

995
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:47,719
transcription as you'd expect me he

996
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:50,838
charging now if we knock down HS f1 this

997
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:53,929
pausing is still the same but we see in

998
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:55,489
Drosophila and we see this decrease in

999
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:58,009
gene body and we interpret that to me

1000
00:43:55,489 --> 00:44:00,289
that HS f1 is working at the second step

1001
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,970
of releasing the polymerase into

1002
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:04,429
productive elongation if you block it

1003
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:10,868
you don't have HS f one but knock it

1004
00:44:04,429 --> 00:44:14,568
down you can't do that second step okay

1005
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:17,150
so historically you know we this has

1006
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:20,779
been an area where a lot of attention

1007
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:23,318
has been focused for regulation we think

1008
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,960
that there are really two major steps

1009
00:44:23,318 --> 00:44:26,789
step of recruit

1010
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,650
once recruited polymerase moves very

1011
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:32,369
quickly to the pause site

1012
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:34,050
this is regulated by factors like gaga

1013
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,820
factor then we have release of pausing

1014
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,960
that's regulated by other kinds many

1015
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,200
many kinds of transcription factors

1016
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,240
including heat shock factor it's this is

1017
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:46,799
general we've seen this in mouse and

1018
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:50,519
human cells and and I'm gonna just skip

1019
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,010
this next bit and go right to the to the

1020
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:59,579
last little bit hang with me we may have

1021
00:44:53,010 --> 00:45:00,830
a only a few minutes for questions no I

1022
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:04,380
can't

1023
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:05,670
well we'll skip the very end bit I'm

1024
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,858
sorry I'm sorry for the guys who had

1025
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:10,588
doing the abdomen technology we don't

1026
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:15,119
quite have time for that anyway takes a

1027
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:17,250
full hour okay so we look now in Mouse

1028
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,309
and humans behave very similarly you

1029
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:23,670
know the gene body on heat shock we see

1030
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:25,920
look at its fold change on genes we see

1031
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:29,369
this their their increase and these are

1032
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,440
hsf one dependent genes that have HS f1

1033
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:34,740
bound to their promoters and we see that

1034
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,780
in h SF 1 - - knockout of 8 of this

1035
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:38,969
master regulatory protein we don't see

1036
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:42,750
this activation of transcription so this

1037
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:44,250
gene body transcription needs HS f1 we

1038
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:46,199
can also look at the pause region pause

1039
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:49,949
region in mammals also goes up

1040
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:55,289
unlike cassava and and it's independent

1041
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:57,949
though however of HS f1 and and so our

1042
00:45:55,289 --> 00:46:01,500
model is this that that upon heat shock

1043
00:45:57,949 --> 00:46:04,739
we we have this increase in release

1044
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:08,338
that's H s f1 dependent so now we flood

1045
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:11,579
the gene with polymerizes and then we

1046
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:14,460
have an increase somewhat the increase

1047
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:17,940
of paused polymerase formation but

1048
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:20,389
that's HS f1 independent and so this

1049
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:22,950
this happens at promoters but it also

1050
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:25,159
we're seeing that there are enhancers

1051
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:28,049
that are also activated I mean not all

1052
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:31,019
keechaka activated genes have HS f1

1053
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:33,930
bound close to them some cases there are

1054
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:35,699
HS one dependent but they're the HS f

1055
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:38,159
must be acting at a distance because

1056
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:38,939
there's no H s f1 bound near it

1057
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,429
so we

1058
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,929
know that HS f1 is part of enhancers and

1059
00:46:41,429 --> 00:46:45,659
we can find some of the we can find

1060
00:46:42,929 --> 00:46:48,328
these globally by looking in nan a chunk

1061
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:49,980
and each honkin scene which with these

1062
00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:52,950
these sites of transcriptional

1063
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:55,409
activation we know that enhancers when

1064
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:58,439
they get activated it's another story

1065
00:46:55,409 --> 00:47:00,809
but when answers get activated they they

1066
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,858
show increased divergent transcription

1067
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:07,108
much like we see on mammalian promoters

1068
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:08,639
HS f1 is associated with those activated

1069
00:47:07,108 --> 00:47:12,769
genes here we're just looking at the

1070
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:16,078
changes in gene body transcription gene

1071
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:18,329
transcription and those that tend to go

1072
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,359
up in heat shock and to have HS f1

1073
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:23,640
associated likewise the transcription we

1074
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,889
see at enhancers is often associated

1075
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:28,920
with hsf one but there's a lot of grey

1076
00:47:25,889 --> 00:47:31,828
dots here which represent cases where we

1077
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,720
see increased transcription but no HS f1

1078
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:42,329
and the model I want to leave you with

1079
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:44,789
here as is the following so we have here

1080
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:46,829
genes the majority of transcribed genes

1081
00:47:44,789 --> 00:47:48,269
are turned down in response to heat

1082
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:50,010
shock so we have a just massive

1083
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:52,949
repression of thousands of genes and

1084
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:55,770
it's repressed at the step of pause

1085
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:58,318
release so just just like activation is

1086
00:47:55,769 --> 00:48:01,199
influencing pause release the the

1087
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:03,358
inhibition leads leaves us with the

1088
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:05,699
pause polymerase and the polymerase is

1089
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,639
that are transcribing clear and enter a

1090
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:11,338
pool now those that are primed for

1091
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:15,118
activation response to heat shock after

1092
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:18,420
heat shock HS f1 binds and we and we see

1093
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,369
the increased transcription and we think

1094
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,559
this pool of polymerase is that's coming

1095
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:24,750
from these mammalian often very long

1096
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,328
genes lots of plume rays start filling

1097
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:30,480
in and hope the induced genes stay

1098
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:32,460
active we look at enhancers we see

1099
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,579
increased transcription upon heat shock

1100
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,990
and some of those are HS f1 bound and we

1101
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,970
see increased transcription but there

1102
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:41,699
are others that show no H s f1 there

1103
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:43,379
that are that are also show increased

1104
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:44,969
transcription they have lineage specific

1105
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,190
factors they have factors there but they

1106
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:49,858
don't have heat shock factor there and

1107
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:51,329
these go up we think because of mass

1108
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:52,650
action we have all these polymerases

1109
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:54,900
being contributed from the

1110
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:56,730
pool of repressed genes that now are

1111
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:01,798
filling by mass action and we want to

1112
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:04,469
test that hypothesis so I'm just going

1113
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:07,170
to say that we've been working for 25

1114
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:09,959
years on RNA aptamer it's trying to

1115
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:11,309
develop these as ways of interfering

1116
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,170
with macro molecular interactions

1117
00:49:11,309 --> 00:49:16,589
because most of biology is driven by

1118
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:21,510
large macromolecular contacts and and

1119
00:49:16,588 --> 00:49:23,548
and and if we can get big inhibitors

1120
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,230
that could interfere with protein

1121
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:27,568
protein interactions of protein nucleons

1122
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:30,480
right protein nucleic acid interactions

1123
00:49:27,568 --> 00:49:32,880
and we have the power to really begin

1124
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,059
testing a lot of our models much more

1125
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:39,180
rigorously and these after is you know

1126
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:41,160
could be very useful as as inhibitors we

1127
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:43,078
select RNA aptamers you can envision you

1128
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:45,118
could block one surface of a protein

1129
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,339
without destroying the protein and have

1130
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,260
the potential act quickly disrupt macro

1131
00:49:47,338 --> 00:49:51,358
molecular interactions and potentially

1132
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,799
have a high success rate I just want to

1133
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,568
say that the way you get after MERS is

1134
00:49:52,798 --> 00:49:56,190
by a process called seelix which I'm not

1135
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:59,460
gonna have time to go into but basically

1136
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:02,880
you select for binding and then reselect

1137
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:04,440
for binding and and do a 8 to 20 cycles

1138
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,798
of this and you burn out a graduate

1139
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,210
student and and and but in the end

1140
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:12,690
you'll get an after with high affinity

1141
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:15,809
for a target and so the past few years

1142
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:19,679
do Loeser and and our Harold Kraig heads

1143
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:21,569
group collaborating to to improve all of

1144
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:23,879
this so we've improved both the RNA

1145
00:50:21,568 --> 00:50:27,329
library we have a library about 10 to

1146
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,640
the 16th and m7 teamers now it's really

1147
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:31,559
really good we improved partitioning

1148
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:33,538
approaches which I really won't go into

1149
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:36,119
but you can see now we can scale up to

1150
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:38,278
something like 96 of these at a time our

1151
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:40,829
goal is to start turning these out and

1152
00:50:38,278 --> 00:50:42,480
massive ways on targeting transcription

1153
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:45,510
factors and other factors of all sort

1154
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,159
and finally bar coding in Illumina

1155
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:49,829
sequencing it takes the expense out of

1156
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:52,739
characterizing you know 96 of these at a

1157
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:55,230
time if one wanted on 28 at a time and a

1158
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:58,949
single lane so doing this we're

1159
00:50:55,230 --> 00:51:01,650
targeting our major factors and and judi

1160
00:50:58,949 --> 00:51:05,189
jee rahe has recently had some huge

1161
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:06,610
success with the SIF after an analysis

1162
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:08,800
by hozier

1163
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,960
in that we can have a napkin or the

1164
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,500
binds very tightly we know where the

1165
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:17,590
region were it does bind and so we can

1166
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:20,170
then show collaboration with Dave

1167
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:22,840
Gilmour that these the this absent

1168
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:25,030
interferes with the ability of this DSi

1169
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:28,360
F this pausing factored in to interfere

1170
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:30,670
with the binding polymerase here we see

1171
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:33,099
a band shift showing the binding of the

1172
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:36,400
SIF and the fact that an optimal will

1173
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:39,179
block that even if added after and then

1174
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:43,720
lastly last slide here I'll show you is

1175
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:45,489
last data slide is that there's we now

1176
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:49,299
express these in cells we can see a

1177
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:52,509
control Optima shows this pausing in his

1178
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,170
gene expression transcription

1179
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:55,540
right-to-left

1180
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:58,360
this is left-to-right and blue and we

1181
00:51:55,539 --> 00:52:01,570
can see that this is reproducible upon

1182
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:03,910
Gaga factor knockdown excuse me upon

1183
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:06,039
after addition we see a decrease in

1184
00:52:03,909 --> 00:52:08,259
pausing and this is reproducible in this

1185
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:10,539
replica it's just one case there's

1186
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:14,590
another case this is even more dramatic

1187
00:52:10,539 --> 00:52:17,289
change loss loss of the pause site and

1188
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:19,480
it's reproducible in replicates and we

1189
00:52:17,289 --> 00:52:21,279
see many genes change during twenty most

1190
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,219
of them show this decrease some show

1191
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,080
shifts or deep increases but also shifts

1192
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:27,879
and pausing as though the pausing is

1193
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,259
disrupted at one side it may be piling

1194
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,539
up at another we're still an early

1195
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,460
analysis of this and I just want to say

1196
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:35,230
conclusion that the transcription

1197
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:37,750
factors can act to establish pause

1198
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:40,840
polymerase or release pause polymerase

1199
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:43,329
Gaga factor I can first HS f1 and acting

1200
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:45,579
later suspect this is a general model

1201
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:47,710
most active enhancers are divergently

1202
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:49,929
transcribed the massive key track down

1203
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:52,150
regulation releases pol ii that loads on

1204
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:54,549
promoters by mass action feeding both

1205
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:57,309
the activated stress gene and I think

1206
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:59,289
priming the response through to

1207
00:52:57,309 --> 00:53:00,579
normality your you're holding the

1208
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:02,949
promoters open you're holding the

1209
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:05,230
enhancers open by this polymerase

1210
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:07,750
filling and at the promoters of both

1211
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:10,090
enhancers and from and and gene

1212
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:12,969
promoters then RNA afterwards I'm

1213
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:15,430
arguing with hope will serve as large

1214
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:18,099
drugs that will be general allow us to

1215
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:19,919
interrupt transcription in vivo and I

1216
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:21,929
want to thank all people

1217
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:25,430
group and especially the Saints who were

1218
00:53:21,929 --> 00:53:30,389
responsible for this particular work and

1219
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:33,239
not that the others of sinners doing

1220
00:53:30,389 --> 00:53:33,690
different projects okay thanks for

1221
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:48,439
attention

1222
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:52,500
I'm sorry went over quick answers the

1223
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:56,329
post-fight direction right yeah that's

1224
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:59,519
honest because of those or just happen

1225
00:53:56,329 --> 00:54:01,559
yeah so there's yeah there's are their

1226
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,119
core promoters for both of those in both

1227
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:05,519
directions and you'll find them at both

1228
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,799
promoters and enhancers and mammals in

1229
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:10,469
Drosophila you you you you have more

1230
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:13,110
elements that contribute to orientation

1231
00:54:10,469 --> 00:54:15,119
on promoters and so promoters tend to

1232
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:18,000
fire the polymerase in one way though

1233
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,889
the factors that regulate tend to be

1234
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,829
between these transcription start sites

1235
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:24,779
in fact we think enhancers both in

1236
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:26,940
mammals and Drosophila and we see

1237
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:29,730
enhancers have this pattern we think the

1238
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:32,400
enhancer is defined by the pause pause

1239
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:36,389
region which has the core to core

1240
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:39,480
promoters and a cluster of transcription

1241
00:54:36,389 --> 00:54:41,849
factor regulatory binding sites and we

1242
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:48,809
think that's the unit structure a basic

1243
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:50,279
unit structure of enhancers yes why

1244
00:54:48,809 --> 00:54:51,269
doesn't he's do this well it's found

1245
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,730
another way to do it

1246
00:54:51,269 --> 00:54:55,860
not all yeast don't do this it turns out

1247
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:58,260
palm B has something that resembles this

1248
00:54:55,860 --> 00:55:01,170
but there's no no in yeast

1249
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:04,140
there's no Nell in plants we looked at

1250
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:06,539
plants by the way plants you've probably

1251
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:10,679
heard the talks given from John Luke's

1252
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:13,139
group I burped oh I think I hope some of

1253
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:15,839
you heard those in in cassava there

1254
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:18,389
there is something looks like pausing

1255
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,000
just like in palm be the yeast palm B

1256
00:55:18,389 --> 00:55:22,500
sacrum Isis doesn't have it but there's

1257
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,050
known elf in either case and so I don't

1258
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,969
know if it's a real pause it we know and

1259
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:28,590
palm be our recent studies of that show

1260
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:30,839
that the polymerase is moving more

1261
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:34,019
slowly there's a maturation step but it

1262
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:36,180
isn't a strict pause plan

1263
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:38,610
also have this divergent transcription

1264
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:41,639
at and enhancers it turns out so we've

1265
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:43,440
seen that in cassava and now in corn and

1266
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:46,739
and these are places where a lot of the

1267
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:57,900
critical snips are located

1268
00:55:46,739 --> 00:56:02,759
yes great Jeff yeah so I should know

1269
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:07,740
this better is Ani here yeah you want to

1270
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:08,790
answer that question what's that oh you

1271
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:11,569
didn't hear the question so the question

1272
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:14,759
is upon we have been repeating all this

1273
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:22,110
upon repeated cycles of heat shock is

1274
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:26,220
there any adaptation and but but but

1275
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:28,620
this but it it does come back to normal

1276
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:30,119
it comes back to this to the non heat

1277
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:33,359
rocks they pretty quickly and pretty

1278
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:37,440
completely except for a few things that

1279
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:41,010
are kind of important I could go into

1280
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:47,670
more detail but what is it the Apatow

1281
00:56:41,010 --> 00:57:02,730
sustains and to be primed what so much

1282
00:56:47,670 --> 00:57:05,070
is retained higher okay so I'm yeah if

1283
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:14,159
you want to I'll hang outside the door

1284
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:15,930
people have other questions this has

1285
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:21,679
been a production of Cornell University

1286
