1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,360
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,359
university

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:14,798
uh anyhow so i'm really happy to be here

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,278
today it's been nice to see all uh as uh

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,439
carlin mentioned i retired at the end of

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,600
january i've sort of been rooting around

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,920
my house for the month of february and

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,560
trying to figure out what to do next and

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,320
that's still a work in progress

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,278
but i wanted to talk

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,079
and

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,880
i also note that i'm the third retiree

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,160
or soon-to-be retiree to give us talk

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,239
this semester

15
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,519
so it seems like it's a trend

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,558
i don't know next year we might have

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,680
what five or six or

18
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,000
anyhow

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,000
it just does underline me that we're in

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,238
this time of transition

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,119
so um so i wanted to talk about uh uh

22
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,799
you know my view of extension and uh

23
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,119
instead of going through a blow by blow

24
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,238
of my retrospective of my career just

25
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,878
talk about

26
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,280
different models that people use for

27
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,920
extension and how is it that growers

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,840
adopt practices what what what are the

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,760
impacts uh that we we

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,680
make uh so in the interest of full

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
disclosure i want to say that this is a

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,280
rerun

33
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,280
and i gave this uh almost this exact

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,400
talk about five years ago up at uh

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,519
agritech

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
and uh so it was great to have that

37
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,078
skeleton

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,000
here for my uh for my talk today

39
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,078
so i just want to start out a little bit

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,239
with my my history

41
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:41,519
and uh i came to cornell in 1985 to be

42
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:44,239
an entomology a graduate student i just

43
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,478
come off the peace corps in honduras

44
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,039
and uh was eager to continue my

45
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,719
education i worked with john and ira

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,040
as my advisor and then

47
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,039
finally they let me have a phd

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,399
and i got to shake hands with frank

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,680
rhodes

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,439
the president of cornell at that time

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,920
uh following that i spent five years

52
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,639
working in grape entomology

53
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,640
a lot of that time i was with working on

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,279
this one insect the eastern grape leaf

55
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,878
hopper i got to know that sucker well in

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,439
five years

57
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,598
but by the end of that it sort of felt

58
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,560
kind of narrow so it was a disciplinary

59
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,399
focus

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,719
and it was just on

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,480
grape grape insects

62
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,598
so when the opportunity came to apply

63
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,598
for the

64
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,959
finger lakes grape program area

65
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,759
education

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,560
extension educator job i i jumped in

67
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,159
and i got that job uh

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,479
and i have to say that initially i

69
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,719
thought i'm an entomologist i know about

70
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,598
bugs i've never grown a grapevine in my

71
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,680
life

72
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,439
so what is it

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,959
exactly that i have to offer these

74
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,878
people because they've been growing

75
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,319
great for four or five generations in

76
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,199
certain cases

77
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,199
uh but i soon found out that

78
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,318
they weren't expecting me to be the guy

79
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,238
that knows how to fill up a sprayer or

80
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,199
exactly prune grapes like like they

81
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,920
could

82
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,359
uh and that was a

83
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,119
that might be the most wonderful

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,640
extension job in new york

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,519
actually

86
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,279
uh so i did that for nine years uh it

87
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,120
was based in penang

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,598
and then i moved back to the station or

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,680
cornell agritech as we call it now as

90
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,839
senior extension associate

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,480
uh to start this uh statewide

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,719
viticulture extension program

93
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,280
and uh carlin's already mentioned some

94
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,680
of the things i did and i'll highlight a

95
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,560
few more things as i go along

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,719
uh so this has been a great run for me

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,920
it's been so much fun

98
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,598
uh

99
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:45,598
being in the position i'm i'm in

100
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,798
so what i wanted to

101
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,878
address

102
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,120
today is well what is it

103
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,318
that growers do with our research

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,400
you know

105
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,719
what changes do they make how do we know

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,200
that they're making change

107
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,039
and how do funding agencies know what

108
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,759
changes they're making

109
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,919
and this is important because funding

110
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,798
funders are increasingly interested in

111
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,238
metrics you know how do you know

112
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,280
and i'll go through a couple funding

113
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,280
models

114
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,600
uh in in in a minute

115
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,079
uh so here's my

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,720
five key takeaways from extension and

117
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,079
the way i ran my extension program

118
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,040
so first of all

119
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,599
uh

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,759
my feeling is that the on-farm research

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,120
and demonstration projects are

122
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,360
kind of the key

123
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,879
i always view that as

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,360
my first job

125
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,319
i wasn't there to solve problems for

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,560
people necessarily to take calls

127
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,478
uh to tell people what to spray so that

128
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,079
gets to the second point is that

129
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,319
extension

130
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,159
some people think it's about being a

131
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,639
consultant

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
but it's not about telling growers what

133
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,960
to do it's

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,840
it's about

135
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,239
learning

136
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,560
i'll get to that in a moment again so

137
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,199
generating explaining data is the thing

138
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,600
that sets us aside from

139
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,520
consultants and people who tell growers

140
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,720
what to do

141
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,478
so that's

142
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,160
kind of our super power

143
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,560
is that we have

144
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,039
access to data we

145
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,280
we generate it

146
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,038
and

147
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,439
this is news to funders but change

148
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,839
doesn't generally happen

149
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,279
within the life of a single project

150
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,198
you know it's more gradual than that

151
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,519
and finally it really pays to be

152
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,960
opportunistic

153
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,959
uh so i want to go through a couple of

154
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
models

155
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,439
so

156
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,038
i think our standard thing that we you

157
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,519
know i grew up with

158
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,639
is that you have the researchers

159
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,519
they're the ones that generate the

160
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,439
knowledge they pass it on to extension

161
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,680
to disseminate the knowledge the growers

162
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,199
adopt the practices

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,160
and then it's kind of like a little

164
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,680
package that you deliver to them

165
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,560
and

166
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,038
so this approach really emphasizes

167
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,240
you know define the project

168
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,560
the problem

169
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,240
uh test hypothesis do an experimental

170
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,000
design get the results

171
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,680
and then at the end you get this

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,120
statement which i've seen in so many

173
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,360
grant proposals

174
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,360
that

175
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,160
results will be disseminated through

176
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,038
winter conferences etc how many of you

177
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,000
pis have written that in grant proposals

178
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,599
yeah

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,199
me too

180
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,720
and then i've been

181
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,800
listed on

182
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,720
many many more grant proposals that say

183
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,680
exactly that

184
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,479
so that's kind of the standard model

185
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,759
uh

186
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,240
and uh

187
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,800
a while back uh we came along probably

188
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,840
about 20 years ago it came along this uh

189
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,280
this outcome-driven project model

190
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:55,359
and uh that was championed with uh

191
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,198
new york farm viability institute the

192
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,160
northeast sarah

193
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,639
program

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,479
and uh this guy r david smith who was

195
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,038
the associate director of

196
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,199
cornell cooperative extension is the guy

197
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,639
behind

198
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,038
disseminating this model and getting

199
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,598
these organizations to adopt it

200
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,199
so here's how that goes first you start

201
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,360
out with grower defined barriers and

202
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,639
opportunities you know you get growers

203
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,800
together saying yeah what are your

204
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,918
problems they set goals you have

205
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,918
performance targets and then milestones

206
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,560
and activities and it's all pointed out

207
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:32,799
to the outcomes that you want right

208
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:36,879
so x number growers adopt practices

209
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,280
save y amount of money or generate

210
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,918
z economic impact

211
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,559
so this is a fine model but

212
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,918
when i wrote these proposals and i did

213
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,360
several of them

214
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:48,240
i found myself in the middle of it

215
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,360
saying

216
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,038
damn it you know i just want to test

217
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,120
these three treatments and see what

218
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,839
happens

219
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,079
and

220
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,560
this model doesn't say anything

221
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,560
necessarily about the knowledge itself

222
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,160
or the things that you learn it's more

223
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,319
about how people

224
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,120
uh react to it

225
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,360
so

226
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,399
where's the science

227
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,400
and

228
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,959
so that model sort of

229
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,239
goes like this you expose 500 growers to

230
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,000
this practice

231
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,960
you receive training

232
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,800
and then

233
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,799
30 rows adopt it and uh

234
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:25,519
and then these are the things that come

235
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,280
out of it

236
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:31,519
metrics success stories outcomes

237
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,120
interesting they never asked for failure

238
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,439
stories right

239
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,679
i tried something that didn't

240
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,240
it didn't work

241
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:45,278
so it's still the packet at the end

242
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,600
and here's an example uh this is from

243
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,320
a few years ago the farm liabilities

244
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,159
website and they say well

245
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,440
you know it's not all about the hours

246
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,799
they clock in research fact sheets etc

247
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,880
it's about

248
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,919
what people do

249
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,799
uh

250
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,639
to this so you're supposed to again

251
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:09,039
measure these metrics have the success

252
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:11,278
stories and then the outcomes okay

253
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,679
uh and i have an example of that this is

254
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:17,838
a project we did

255
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:20,159
2006 to 2008 we put together this

256
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,399
comprehensive sustainable practices

257
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,559
workbook called vine balance

258
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,039
i did this with members of the industry

259
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,239
it's really comprehensive it covers pest

260
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,480
management

261
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:36,720
viticulture spray technology etc etc

262
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,039
uh so it covers a wide range of things

263
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,959
but here's sort of the bottom line

264
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,079
in this again is off the farm viability

265
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,439
website

266
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,360
is that

267
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,680
what it came down to is the only metrics

268
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,560
we could come up with was

269
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:53,838
nitrogen use so

270
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,639
so they invested 148 000 in the

271
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,240
uh

272
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,439
in the project

273
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,799
uh

274
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,440
we reported that growers reduced

275
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,759
nitrogen applications by 40

276
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,040
percent and here's the return on

277
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,439
investment

278
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,360
well that's just one aspect of something

279
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,440
where everything else if it's about

280
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,278
sustainability it's a little bit harder

281
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,959
to measure because it's about grower

282
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,879
relations it's about

283
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,039
community it's about

284
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,159
environmental quality so how do you put

285
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,759
a dollar figure on that

286
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,278
it's harder than

287
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,120
something i can do

288
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,439
so here's how i think it

289
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,399
actually works or should work

290
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,720
we have

291
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,639
growers researchers extension

292
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,079
all kind of communicating with each

293
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,759
other the researchers bring the

294
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,759
disciplinary focus

295
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,679
extension brings a generalist focus

296
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,519
and then come up with ideas and

297
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,559
questions trials

298
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,560
you know

299
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,958
that can be laboratory and field trials

300
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,719
collaborative on-farm demos and then you

301
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,719
have the results but you're also

302
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,639
communicating during the project and

303
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,079
then growers try something and then they

304
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,120
adapt it right and then it goes back

305
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,519
so

306
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,839
so really

307
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,200
it's definitely not a package it's more

308
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,880
of a

309
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,278
more of a process basically

310
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,200
uh so i want to offer several uh

311
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,120
examples of things where

312
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,879
we know that growers have really changed

313
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,200
their practices

314
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,159
and then i'm gonna go on and talk about

315
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,640
some

316
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,879
field trials and sort of the impacts so

317
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,439
here's one that dave ghidori did

318
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:34,078
in the early 2000s

319
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,079
he took some

320
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,639
powdery mildew and

321
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,600
inoculated clusters at various times

322
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,559
and kind of overturned the prevailing

323
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,639
uh

324
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,719
thought about

325
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,799
how to keep your clusters clean from

326
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,920
powdery mildew and later on donnie

327
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,799
mildew

328
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,838
so

329
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,759
before he did this people thought well

330
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,480
they're susceptible that the entire

331
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,958
summer and until they're until you get

332
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,920
reach uh eight eight degrees bricks when

333
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,838
they start ripening so you gotta keep it

334
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,559
things on well he found that they

335
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,079
actually became resistant much earlier

336
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,039
uh so you know four to six weeks after

337
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,679
bloom

338
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,519
uh then you could be sure that if your

339
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,199
clusters were clean they they're gonna

340
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,759
stay clean

341
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,720
and uh so this has been a cornerstone uh

342
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,519
this is

343
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,399
stuff that wayne wilcox wrote and

344
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,720
so

345
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,240
uh we really emphasize a pre-bloom to

346
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,759
early post-bloom

347
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
uh

348
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,879
sprays

349
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,519
you know for the times when the grapes

350
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:40,159
are most susceptible and so forth and

351
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,200
then after that you can sort of ease off

352
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,838
uh on the on the things

353
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,079
uh directed at the clusters

354
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,440
so again this is a cornerstone of our

355
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:54,078
ipm program is this

356
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,320
uh another one is uh involved justine

357
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,078
vandenheuvel and gavin sachs

358
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,240
and it was all about leaf removal and

359
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:04,000
when you should do it right

360
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,440
and uh before they did this study

361
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,360
people knew that leaf removal was

362
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,320
important that cluster exposure was

363
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,000
important

364
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,000
but they just sort of say well you know

365
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,440
i'm gonna do it when i get get around to

366
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,120
it and you know

367
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,079
you know sometime you know mid-summer or

368
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,039
something well uh gavin

369
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,879
uh a wine chemist

370
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,679
went out in the vineyard every week

371
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:28,078
collected samples measured

372
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:30,078
methoxypyrazines and found out that the

373
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,399
cluster exposure very early in the

374
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,439
season really had a big impact on how

375
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,440
many of these

376
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,760
methoxy piercings were produced and

377
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,800
therefore how many of them that you

378
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,919
ended up with at the end of the season

379
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,039
so

380
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,879
uh so that

381
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,838
alerted people to the fact that the

382
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:52,639
early leaf removal was important

383
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,000
and uh and it really changed practices

384
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,959
it went from

385
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,879
i'll do it when i get around to it to

386
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,799
god i better get out there and do that

387
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,198
because it's so important

388
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,519
so we wrote this up in the first issue

389
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,319
of appalachian cornell in this article

390
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,240
called

391
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,440
cornell researchers track

392
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,480
tackle

393
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,360
green flavors and red wines

394
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,959
uh

395
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,879
andrew landers uh was here for about 15

396
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,479
years or so before he

397
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:24,159
left and he's back in

398
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:28,560
england but his spray trials uh you know

399
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:30,159
sprayer set up using deflectors etc etc

400
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,879
i always used to joke with him that

401
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:35,278
every talk could be about improving

402
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,838
deposition and reducing drift

403
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:40,240
uh because that's what he contemplated

404
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,880
so he had set up this patternator you

405
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,278
know

406
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,399
one of his many demonstrations at field

407
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,120
meetings

408
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,600
and then uh he did collaborate with uh

409
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,759
uh jim myers and then

410
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,519
justine vandenhuvel

411
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,559
were able to quantify through this thing

412
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,600
called the epqa

413
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,838
enhanced

414
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,800
point quadrant analysis

415
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,240
that the spray coverage you know really

416
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,719
was

417
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,000
uh highly dependent on

418
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,399
the fruit

419
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,198
uh exposure

420
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,639
uh

421
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,958
and uh so

422
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,639
this grower bill del ripple took took it

423
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,319
upon himself to build one of these

424
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,959
patternators

425
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,320
out of window screens and uh

426
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:26,239
so here's an example of a grower

427
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,600
taking something that was designed for

428
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,839
research and

429
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,120
applying it to their own vineyard so he

430
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,000
built it for

431
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,198
what 50 50 bucks and he says in

432
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,399
15 minutes i can run my sprayer and

433
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,198
find out you know how how the spray is

434
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,639
being

435
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,838
distributed and make adjustments thereby

436
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,399
okay

437
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,560
uh this is a little bit more long term

438
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,440
and this is our nitrogen use guidelines

439
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:56,638
when i started i talked to growers

440
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,120
in 97 and they say oh yeah 300 pounds

441
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,919
ammonium nitrate 100 pounds actual

442
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,919
nitrogen per acre you know and i can't

443
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,838
afford to skimp on this

444
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,439
it's cheap insurance

445
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,240
you hear that a lot

446
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,199
uh but nelson schallis uh

447
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,680
1960s established this experiment called

448
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,000
the west tier factorial i can't get into

449
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,838
details about it but found out that you

450
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,879
know no matter how much nitrogen they

451
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,680
applied

452
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,278
you know if it was above 50 pounds

453
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,319
they only got a little extra volume

454
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,720
growth

455
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,680
and uh no extra yield

456
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,560
so

457
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,319
um so he was able to say you know 50

458
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,838
pounds that's

459
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,278
that's it so uh

460
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,680
you know that went through bob poole

461
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,159
terry bates and uh my predecessor dave

462
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:47,359
peterson started talking about this in

463
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,439
maybe the 1980s early 80s

464
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,278
and then i carried on and pretty soon i

465
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,120
talked to growers at

466
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,559
coffee shops i said well

467
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,519
how much are you putting on this year

468
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,599
well

469
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,519
oh i backed it off to 70 pounds

470
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,120
next year 50 pounds

471
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,519
and of course many of our vinifera

472
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,000
growers don't apply any additional

473
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,439
nitrogen at all so

474
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,119
so this is a big

475
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,720
big success and

476
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,918
this is what we cited in our farm

477
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,240
viability grant but uh you know 30 to 50

478
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,799
percent reduction in

479
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,199
nitrogen application or excess nitrogen

480
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,400
application

481
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,600
okay so i want to move on now to some

482
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,840
examples of on-farm trials

483
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,519
and the first one is field trials that

484
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,439
educate me you know being an

485
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,679
entomologist not having any background

486
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,840
in nutrition or not that much in

487
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,679
horticulture

488
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,678
and then surveys

489
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,480
to gauge how important an issue was

490
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,320
demonstrations that happened alongside

491
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,640
research trials

492
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,240
and then sort of serendipity how one

493
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,320
thing turned into something else and

494
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,839
then and then i want to finish it off

495
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,759
with a

496
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:01,279
project that's had an enormous economic

497
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,359
impact but it's based on stuff that was

498
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,079
started in the 60s and

499
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,279
and moved on with our concord growers

500
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,918
so

501
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,119
my first example is effective foliar and

502
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,919
soil

503
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,399
uh

504
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,320
boron applications and uh

505
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,919
you know i mean i was an entomologist

506
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,599
this was early on in my career i didn't

507
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,840
know anything about boron

508
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,319
so i decided to do this trial with kind

509
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,839
of a a guy who's kind of a back bencher

510
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,279
you know he doesn't really go to

511
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,839
meetings he doesn't

512
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,480
so but he had a low boron vineyard and

513
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,558
so we set up a trial there and compared

514
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,640
you know soil and no soil and different

515
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,879
rates to foliar sprays

516
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,160
so here's the results and this is you

517
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,200
know like the

518
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,558
second year or the first year of my uh

519
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,798
extension

520
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,359
uh found out that the soil and foliar

521
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:53,440
application increased the yield burst in

522
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:55,678
his vineyard increased a fruit set but

523
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,440
one pound of foliar was as good as you

524
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,919
know two and a half pounds

525
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,600
and two and a half pounds all often

526
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,759
resulted in fourier

527
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,119
uh injury

528
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,919
um

529
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,839
so

530
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,880
this is the pedial results and the

531
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:13,439
foliar increased patio more on more than

532
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,679
the soil but two and a half pounds again

533
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,360
was too much and one was

534
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,640
enough

535
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,759
and then

536
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,919
the boron

537
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,200
levels dropped in august when we sampled

538
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,480
again but

539
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,319
but not as much with the soil

540
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,960
application so that gave more sustained

541
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,918
release of warren it was important

542
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,679
so i put that in my newsletter and uh

543
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,840
and that gave me the confidence to be

544
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,120
able to make recommendations to growers

545
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,000
about boron

546
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,319
and i think hadn't had an impact

547
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,240
again how do we measure it

548
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:48,240
uh next example i want to uh

549
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,960
relate has to do with uh

550
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,120
wine balance our important

551
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,038
thing and uh

552
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,519
and uh

553
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,599
so this is an opportunistic thing that

554
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,639
was made possible because alan laxo

555
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,279
retired

556
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,360
he had a vineyard up at the station

557
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,440
and nobody was going to take it over so

558
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,839
i did and that gave me an opportunity to

559
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,679
do some really radical things

560
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,279
and run that vineyard into the ground

561
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,240
which i did over the next several years

562
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,558
uh

563
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,279
okay and and this is something where you

564
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,678
know

565
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,440
i had done all the reading and but i

566
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,519
really wanted to experience

567
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,960
what happens when you manipulate carbon

568
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,000
source and sink

569
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
things

570
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,839
so

571
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,159
uh

572
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:35,519
again you know the source being the leaf

573
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,520
area the sinks or the carbohydrates

574
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,558
that are produced you know going to

575
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,359
different places shoot tips fruit roots

576
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,399
storage and so forth

577
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,599
so

578
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,320
i decided to do this experiment to

579
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,719
radically manipulate these things

580
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,519
in uh in that vineyard

581
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,000
uh

582
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,839
and i wanted to measure how particularly

583
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,679
how defoliating vines affected the bud

584
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,480
hardiness because that's the sort of a

585
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,480
thing

586
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,000
is that uh

587
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,400
uh you want to maximize the bud

588
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
hardiness but what happens when you get

589
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,080
downing mill to late in the season you

590
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,319
lose all your foliage etc

591
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,918
okay so i i'm not going to tell you

592
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,599
everything about this but we established

593
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,759
five treatments we had a standard one

594
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,639
with 24 shoots

595
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,480
we had one where we

596
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,960
limited it to eight shoots we defrosted

597
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,000
some vines and then we defoliated

598
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,360
you know

599
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,359
one time and two times

600
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,279
lines

601
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,280
uh

602
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,720
not exactly what i'd planned but you

603
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,558
know here we go the standard was

604
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,880
supposed to be balance cropping

605
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:42,240
you know eight shoots under cropped

606
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,280
uh defruited no crop

607
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,720
uh

608
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,798
sink limited

609
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,759
and then uh overcropped and source

610
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:49,599
limited

611
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,519
with a high

612
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,639
fruit full or

613
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,440
really

614
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,640
uh

615
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,360
infinite fruit to foliage

616
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,159
uh ratio so this is uh what we did we

617
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:05,759
defoliated vines in early in july by

618
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,080
august they'd uh regrow grown

619
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,359
uh a complete other canopy

620
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:10,158
and so we

621
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,959
then

622
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,159
sort of cut them off at the tenth node

623
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,480
and uh and let those vines continue to

624
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,840
ripen the fruit continue to ripen

625
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,120
without any leaves whatsoever

626
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:27,839
so here's the results in a nutshell

627
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,759
so the standard is on the left uh if we

628
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,879
look at the eight chute

629
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,960
we reduced the yield by sixty percent uh

630
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,280
uh but increased the cluster weight by

631
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,679
forty percent so you know the clusters

632
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,279
were forty percent bigger

633
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,919
of course there were far fewer of them

634
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,158
which is accounts for all the yield loss

635
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,720
uh defoliated them once at fruit set we

636
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,640
got really tiny berries

637
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,480
had the same number of clusters but our

638
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,480
yield went down by 60 percent our

639
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,038
cluster weight by

640
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,360
uh by 40 percent

641
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,759
and then uh but the fruit ripened

642
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,079
because we had another canopy there

643
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,079
and then when we defoliated it again you

644
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,720
know we lost the yield

645
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,960
minus 60 cluster weight down by 50

646
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,558
percent and of course these grapes

647
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,159
didn't ripen at all

648
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,079
and

649
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,679
and then the buds were not as hardy this

650
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,480
is the only treatment we had that

651
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,679
affected the bud hardiness negatively

652
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,400
and a lot of those vines died so i ran

653
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,519
them into the ground

654
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,120
uh okay so so um

655
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:32,798
so that's one of the things those are

656
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,798
the two things i did to

657
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,960
find out well how far can i push things

658
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,279
one one way or another you know what

659
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,278
impact do our practices have

660
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,639
and i could do that at a the experiment

661
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:43,440
station because i didn't have to worry

662
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,799
about

663
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,120
the problem

664
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:50,480
uh the third example i have is a survey

665
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,639
that we did about grapevine leaf roll uh

666
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,319
so we wanted to survey the vineyards to

667
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,840
measure the extent

668
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,240
and uh

669
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,519
impact and this all started out with

670
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,880
mark fuchs

671
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,639
um

672
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,440
i bruce

673
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,278
who came and uh

674
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,120
shortly after he came to cornell started

675
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,679
looking at vineyards and we found a lot

676
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,359
of leaf roll this is uh limburger four

677
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,640
rosa limberger with the leaf roll

678
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,918
symptoms

679
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,000
and uh

680
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,480
very prevalent and i was later to find

681
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,640
out that all the limburger wood came

682
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,038
from one source and it was all infected

683
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,480
with leaf roll in about 10 vineyards and

684
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,240
the fender lakes

685
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,319
so we did this survey

686
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,519
and mark did this

687
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:35,200
several locations uh i think about 70

688
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,240
vineyards that we did

689
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,480
and uh we found out that uh it was

690
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,120
indeed very common seventy percent of

691
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,519
our vineyards uh vinifera vineyards had

692
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,038
uh at least some leaf roll some a lot

693
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,359
some not so much

694
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:53,440
you know hybrid varieties you know about

695
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:54,879
57 of them i had had a

696
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,120
different leaf oil

697
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,320
so my part oh okay excuse me and then

698
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,479
mark

699
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,918
measured the spread and found out that

700
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,558
year over year

701
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,480
uh this uh these mealybugs at the top of

702
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,480
the screen that you can see

703
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,079
um really

704
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,798
would transmit it from vine divine

705
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:15,199
within the uh

706
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,918
the vineyard

707
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,840
so my part was to go to

708
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,000
a vineyard where i knew there was some

709
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,918
infected and some non-infected or

710
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,880
non-symptomatic vines

711
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,200
and do periodic fruit sampling

712
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,559
so i did this and uh you know basically

713
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,798
the upshot was we found out that uh

714
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:35,918
at least in terms of bricks

715
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,079
uh

716
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,919
it delayed ripening by about two weeks

717
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,759
which is a problem with cabernet franc

718
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,440
when you harvest it in the middle of

719
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,038
october anyhow

720
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,120
so essentially

721
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:50,079
the infected vines were never getting

722
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,239
the fruit was never getting ripe on them

723
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:55,038
so that's in the single vineyard i then

724
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,240
you know follow that up with looking at

725
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,960
paired vines in different uh vineyards

726
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,359
in 11 different vineyards and found out

727
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,240
you know at a given time

728
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,240
uh

729
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,079
up to three and a half degrees bricks

730
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,558
difference between the

731
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:13,278
infected and non-infected vine and this

732
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,918
was after 2004 when we lost a lot of

733
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:18,720
vines due to uh winter injury

734
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,799
and uh here's a you know and they'd

735
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,600
plant new vines and they'd be infected

736
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,200
so here they've lost a vine and then a

737
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,759
couple years later they find out that

738
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,558
their replants are infected with virus

739
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,839
and

740
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,720
they have to go and replace them again

741
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,879
so

742
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,278
um so this uh really convinced a lot of

743
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,480
growers to pay attention to leaf roll

744
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,440
and we put this all in this uh

745
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,759
article

746
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,880
uh about grapevine leaf roll

747
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,640
and then that was followed up uh with uh

748
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,520
and mark

749
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,799
enlisted miguel gomez and operators to

750
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,639
do an economic analysis of lethal

751
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:57,839
and he went beyond what economists

752
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,000
usually do

753
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,399
you know what economists usually do is

754
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,480
say well this cost the industry x

755
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,080
millions of dollars but they went

756
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,319
through and they did different

757
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,639
management scenarios and a net present

758
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,319
value analysis to show

759
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,480
if you actually

760
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,519
did different management where you'd end

761
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,558
up

762
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,000
so he came up with a figure that uh of

763
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,398
you know probably ten thousand dollars

764
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,759
an acre over the 25 year

765
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,759
uh life of the vineyard

766
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,918
okay uh here's one with uh another one

767
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,399
with justine

768
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,120
uh who again just after she arrived

769
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:37,439
started some uh different trials with

770
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:40,000
canopy management and this one was about

771
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,679
uh shoot thinning uh with

772
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,650
marichelle fosh

773
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,840
and uh so

774
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,919
[Music]

775
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,839
she did a study where she did

776
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,240
control versus

777
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,798
unshoot thin versus shoot then early

778
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,720
harvest and late harvest and then

779
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:59,038
did some wine sensory analysis on that

780
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,880
uh and this gets to the point of well

781
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,119
how much does it cost and how much is

782
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,840
the benefit so i went out with these

783
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:08,479
guys one day and timed them as they were

784
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,519
kind of going at slow walking speeds

785
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,200
doing the

786
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,480
the shoot thing

787
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,600
and you know about 15 seconds per vine

788
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,880
that uh translates to three hours an

789
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,158
acre 50 50 bucks but then they lose crop

790
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,320
too so

791
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,240
they're reducing the crop while thinning

792
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,398
the shoots so that's 750 dollars in

793
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,399
lower seats so to make this pay

794
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,759
essentially you have to you need to get

795
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:35,199
an extra 800 an acre in quality

796
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,480
whether that's being able to sell your

797
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,880
grapes or

798
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,079
have higher priced wine as opposed to

799
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,320
planck

800
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,319
right

801
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:47,119
and then uh here's a timing issue if you

802
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,319
wait until the shoots are that long it's

803
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,359
gonna take you

804
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:54,079
five times as long to do so this is uh

805
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,918
steve lurch justine's uh

806
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,000
technician that

807
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,399
was a little late on a study that

808
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,200
justine was doing that year

809
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:05,599
okay so what did justine find

810
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,519
uh well she found that and this is

811
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,199
compared to the control you know where

812
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,639
they harvested early they didn't shoot

813
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,558
then

814
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,240
just doing the shoot thinning increased

815
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,519
some of the good stuff fruit banana

816
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,480
apple rose

817
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,599
decreased some of the bad stuffs

818
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,000
uh

819
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,038
so that had an effect just the shoot

820
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,919
thing

821
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,119
uh just harvesting them a week later had

822
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,720
a big effect

823
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,319
uh kind of comparable

824
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,038
and if you did them both together it was

825
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:36,480
kind of an added additive effect

826
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:39,440
so these are interesting uh results

827
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,399
um and then she measured you know

828
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,240
revenue

829
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:43,839
and uh costs

830
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,720
and figured out that the grower would

831
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,599
have to receive you know 161 dollar more

832
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,360
a ton to actually pay for you know

833
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:54,079
pay for that thinning

834
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,719
in terms of the lost yield or 22 cents a

835
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,519
bottle or 31 cents a bottle so that's

836
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,640
fine

837
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,079
um

838
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,679
so

839
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,519
about a year after she did that i

840
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,399
decided to go out and do

841
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:09,038
demo trials in eight different vineyards

842
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,639
mostly hires and i'm not going to go

843
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,839
through this whole table but

844
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,440
you know 18 to 42 seconds per vine

845
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:21,199
half a ton to 3.3 tons per acre

846
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:24,080
you know differences in lost yield and

847
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:28,000
quality and then we did see

848
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:30,558
a very consistent uh bricks effect

849
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,240
uh so this is a one notable thing where

850
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,440
we actually made wines out of these so

851
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,599
this is a block called the leon mio

852
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,919
down on keuka lake and you can see the

853
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,079
difference between the clusters there

854
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,880
uh unthinned on the left thin on the

855
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:47,038
right

856
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,039
a totally different cluster shape

857
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,359
in

858
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:50,719
set

859
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:54,240
so

860
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,240
what happened in this well um

861
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,319
we reduced the shoots providing clusters

862
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,919
provide crop weight tons per acre by

863
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:03,359
about 30 to you know almost 50 percent

864
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,679
but increase the cluster weight the

865
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,158
berry weight and the berries per cluster

866
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,519
also increase the bricks so came up with

867
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,519
higher quality fruit right

868
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:17,359
okay so if we look at uh you know he was

869
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:20,158
getting 800 per ton

870
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,479
so we figured that with the amount we'd

871
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,360
send off in this low yielding vineyard

872
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,159
he'd need an extra 300 per ton

873
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,158
or 50

874
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,359
50 cents a bottle

875
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,759
for the price

876
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:36,719
so that goes a certain way but

877
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:39,519
uh the problem was that this is a highly

878
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,000
prized wine without chute thinning i

879
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,880
went for 20 bucks a bottle

880
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,159
and if he had one and you know a ton

881
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,559
less fruit per acre that translates to

882
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:52,640
831 fewer bottles of wine to sell

883
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,798
and 16 000

884
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,159
lower gross receipts

885
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:58,480
so

886
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,480
uh

887
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,158
so in this case you know he can sell all

888
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,599
he wants

889
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,200
and the quality

890
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,599
the extra quality he gets probably

891
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,038
doesn't matter

892
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,639
uh

893
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,839
and i'm going to skip over this this

894
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,640
just shows so we did the same thing on

895
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,759
tremonet

896
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,559
but it was a

897
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,480
lower proportion of the yield and really

898
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:23,759
it only made a 90

899
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,599
difference per ton for equal returns or

900
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,319
13 cents

901
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,359
so highly cultivar dependent and yield

902
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,240
dependent

903
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:34,639
so uh here's uh what you know the wine

904
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,038
evaluation said for justine's project

905
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,320
yeah they like the shoot thin wine

906
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,558
you know they found it was different

907
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,639
than the control and they preferred it

908
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,798
over the control right

909
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,440
so that's one result

910
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,839
uh and i did with the leon mio we went

911
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,080
uh to the rape growers convention and

912
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,439
did side by side of the thinned and

913
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,480
unthinned

914
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,120
vines

915
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,960
and all the growers pretty much thought

916
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:01,678
they were different they tasted

917
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,798
differently so which one do you prefer

918
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,080
60 said i like the shoot thin

919
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,079
40

920
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:11,359
said i like the north shoot thin so

921
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:12,798
that's pretty even thing so i just under

922
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,558
the lines the point that it's really

923
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,079
hard to relate this to

924
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:19,440
dollars or

925
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,879
willingness to pay for the wine

926
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,000
so

927
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,000
uh okay um

928
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,240
fifth example a shoot thinning trial

929
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,880
turned into a fruit rot trial this was

930
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,000
uh one where i was looking at the impact

931
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,600
of uh shoot thinning and on yield and

932
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,240
quality of uh vignol but it turned out

933
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,439
you know we we turned this into a rot

934
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,599
trial

935
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,919
uh so

936
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,359
here's the vsp with suit thinning no

937
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,960
shoot thinning

938
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,599
high cordon with

939
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,759
shoot thinning or no shoot thinning

940
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,000
and then since this was machine harvest

941
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,798
with long spurs there was a lot of these

942
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,398
persistent racuses from last year a lot

943
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,398
of botrytis

944
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,839
inoculum on those

945
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,479
so we did a trial where we uh

946
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:09,199
so

947
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,639
so here's the here's what the what the

948
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:15,118
wines we made out of them look like

949
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,760
uh anyhow so uh wayne went out there and

950
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,760
did the botrytis ratings and uh

951
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,839
and we looked at uh all three scenarios

952
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,599
on the two

953
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:29,039
two train systems

954
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,039
and uh basically um you know the top

955
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,639
wire cordon that always had more

956
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,119
botrytis

957
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,679
and uh and really was you know it never

958
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,559
got below 50 on that

959
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,559
uh but when we looked at the vsp

960
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,320
you know with none we had a certain

961
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,320
amount if we

962
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,559
uh removed the rakeses we got some

963
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,480
reduction if we shoot then we got more

964
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,159
reduction if we did them both

965
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,960
you know they sort of had this uh

966
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,960
additive effect

967
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,358
and this is what the fruit looked like

968
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,480
you know shoot thin

969
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:03,279
versus non-shooting

970
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,679
oh

971
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,359
and anna catherine mansfield refused to

972
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,358
make wine out of the stuff on the right

973
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:17,280
okay so last example here

974
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:20,079
uh and this is something that uh is sort

975
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,400
of a totally new way of thinking about

976
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,359
managing crop load on concourse because

977
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,480
concords are a commodity crop

978
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:30,799
and uh in high yield is you know high

979
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,400
yield and low cost that's always been

980
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,280
the objectives that we've been shooting

981
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,280
for

982
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,560
so uh 2013 was a very heavy crop year

983
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,320
and uh

984
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,559
and it was interesting i talked to rich

985
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,800
ertl the director of uh cooperative

986
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:47,440
extension after excuse me grower

987
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,400
relations at national grape cooperative

988
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,679
and that year a lot of their growers did

989
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,079
mechanical

990
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,159
shoot thinning for the first time or

991
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,640
excuse me cluster things so

992
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,399
fifty percent of our new air kick was 33

993
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:03,279
of our pennsylvania

994
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,480
acres mechanically thinned in july

995
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,359
and uh as a result they were able to get

996
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,519
eight to nine tons and uh deliver it

997
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,279
early if they didn't then they would

998
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,800
have to wait till the end of the season

999
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,480
and it might not even get ripe

1000
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,480
so this is a huge economic

1001
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,519
benefit in that one year

1002
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,480
and it goes back to foundational uh

1003
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,239
concepts of crop load uh done by nelson

1004
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,240
charles in the 60s

1005
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,078
and then bob poole and terry bates

1006
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,879
followed it up with minimal pruning

1007
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,880
terry refined it into kind of a system

1008
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,960
and then they did lots of demonstration

1009
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,680
so the conservative estimate of the

1010
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,960
impact was that it was nine million

1011
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,838
dollars

1012
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,039
uh

1013
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:51,838
in 2013.

1014
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,679
uh and just a note here's how they do it

1015
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,400
you take your grape harvester out and

1016
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,480
you harvest 48 feet of roe that's 1 100

1017
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,639
of an acre you weigh the fruit

1018
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,320
and then you go to this table

1019
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:06,960
to say well i got this much fruit and

1020
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,640
you know basically at the 30 days post

1021
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,079
bloom is going to be you know half of

1022
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,239
what you're going to end up with at the

1023
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,480
end of the season so then they can take

1024
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,759
their mechanical harvester out

1025
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,480
in

1026
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,359
early august and you know thin it and

1027
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,119
then hasten the ripening war

1028
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:27,759
avoid delaying the ripening actually

1029
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,920
depending on the the growing season so

1030
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,920
that's what growers did and uh here's

1031
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,440
what happened uh the purple bar is

1032
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,320
2013.

1033
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,159
left side is uh the ones that thin they

1034
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,000
got less yield

1035
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:45,838
the n thin higher yield

1036
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,480
and this is from spray record excuse me

1037
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:49,440
harvest weight records

1038
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,519
so

1039
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,720
when they thinned they kind of evened

1040
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,159
out things they got less in 2013 more in

1041
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,399
2014.

1042
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:01,440
in the end then they got a lot in 2013

1043
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,680
but then they paid for it 2014 with much

1044
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,000
much lower yields so

1045
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:08,239
all told you know averaged over several

1046
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,519
vineyards it was worth a half a ton

1047
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:10,559
extra fruit

1048
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,358
to them

1049
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,358
over the two years

1050
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,639
and this is a tribute to all the hard

1051
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,640
work that the lake erie

1052
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:21,598
uh squad has done

1053
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,639
over

1054
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,800
many many years to refine these concepts

1055
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,799
and

1056
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:31,519
you know it's interesting it's it

1057
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,680
we get a lot of press for sort of new

1058
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,480
things that we do

1059
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,118
but

1060
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,079
less it's it's it's harder to come up

1061
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,480
with

1062
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,039
something that is the result of years

1063
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,280
and years of sustained effort that

1064
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:46,880
really finally has an impact hard to

1065
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,640
interest the cornell chronicle and that

1066
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,760
stuff

1067
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:53,039
um

1068
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,880
okay so those are all my examples

1069
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,119
and uh

1070
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,960
so we have a couple things you know on

1071
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,599
the right side is what scientists like

1072
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,599
to do right

1073
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,800
on the left side is what some of our

1074
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,800
funding agencies and

1075
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,440
like to do they like the metrics well do

1076
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,359
we have metrics for everything

1077
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,639
well there are times when we can do what

1078
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:16,719
they suggest

1079
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:21,199
which is you know document how many

1080
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,199
growers have done this that or the other

1081
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,119
but oftentimes that's hard to do

1082
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,199
and and

1083
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,358
what are the alternatives well send out

1084
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,598
a survey to growers how much nitrogen

1085
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:34,960
you using this year how much

1086
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,280
and i hate

1087
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,760
doing that because growers hate

1088
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,880
doing all those surveys

1089
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,119
so

1090
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,519
more often than not we're just

1091
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,119
reduced to saying things like well

1092
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,280
growers report that they're doing

1093
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,680
something as a result of our

1094
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,680
efforts

1095
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,760
and meanwhile i know that

1096
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,960
uh our extension programs have had

1097
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,720
a huge

1098
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,880
extension and research programs have had

1099
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,759
a huge impact on the industry

1100
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
helped

1101
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,319
uh

1102
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,358
foster its growth development

1103
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:14,480
ecologic and economic sustainability but

1104
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:18,799
sometimes that's just hard to put into

1105
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,800
return on investment sort of metrics

1106
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,159
so

1107
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,480
uh again

1108
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:25,920
this is the thing that uh i've tried to

1109
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,440
do

1110
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,358
throughout my career is these

1111
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,358
collaborative trials kind of the heart

1112
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:33,119
of my extension effort

1113
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,199
and uh

1114
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,200
and again i believe you know the line

1115
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:41,039
between research and extension is best

1116
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:41,039
if it's kept really really blurry

1117
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,838
but

1118
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,318
i've managed to

1119
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:47,759
over the course of my career

1120
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:51,279
have the opportunity to work with so

1121
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,880
many great faculty members

1122
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,839
tax extension qualities

1123
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,640
and uh and growers

1124
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:00,159
so

1125
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,318
that's it

1126
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,519
and thank you for your attention

1127
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:04,960
yeah marvin

1128
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,639
you know we're seeing more and more

1129
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,079
wineries going and stuff like that but

1130
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:09,358
the numbers you show

1131
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,880
make it seem like i don't know if i

1132
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,400
would invest my money doing that um so

1133
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,160
what do you advise

1134
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,838
people to come to you now and say hey

1135
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:19,279
i'm really interested in

1136
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,119
certain winery

1137
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,920
yeah

1138
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,000
well what do i advise people who say

1139
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,838
geez i just want to grow grapes and and

1140
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,760
have a winery

1141
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,358
um

1142
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,200
well there's a lot more money in the

1143
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,799
value-added part of it than there isn't

1144
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,838
the grape

1145
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,119
uh

1146
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:41,039
but i've had examples of people uh you

1147
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,559
know that come to mind like a guy who

1148
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,880
came into my

1149
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,838
office in

1150
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,960
1997 and

1151
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:52,159
or 1998 and said you know i'm a

1152
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,199
pharmacist i want to grow grapes

1153
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:55,199
and

1154
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,960
mentally rolled my eyes and you know

1155
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,919
said well are you aware of this this and

1156
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,679
this

1157
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,838
often i try and talk people out of it

1158
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:05,759
because you know that's what you do uh

1159
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:08,159
but you know here

1160
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,160
uh 20 years later he has a 50 acre

1161
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,639
vineyard loves growing grapes

1162
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:13,759
and made a real success out of it

1163
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:14,559
because

1164
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,640
he

1165
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:19,358
did his homework and so forth so

1166
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:21,279
um so i guess telling him uh do your

1167
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:22,719
homework

1168
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,319
and uh

1169
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:25,519
i guess a lot of people

1170
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:27,920
uh

1171
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,519
uh really repeat the thing how do you

1172
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,200
how do you make a small fortune in the

1173
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,119
wine industry you start out with a large

1174
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,358
portion that sort of thing

1175
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,000
uh but then you know i have an another

1176
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:40,318
one boundary breaks vineyard uh again

1177
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,280
this is a guy that came in and said

1178
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:43,358
you know

1179
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,200
i'm a wine geek i want to make the best

1180
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:46,480
riesling in the world and how many times

1181
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,799
have i heard that

1182
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,199
over the years how many people have

1183
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,240
you know sort of tried to do that

1184
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:54,399
uh

1185
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,399
but

1186
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,760
but he's successful and now you know has

1187
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,720
30 acres of grapes has a wonderful

1188
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,880
business

1189
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,480
he was very good at marketing very very

1190
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,760
intentional about it

1191
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,679
so

1192
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,680
you can make a success of it

1193
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,440
it's just

1194
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,800
don't expect it to be easy or don't

1195
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,519
expect to

1196
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,560
actually be making money uh

1197
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,559
uh

1198
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,039
until it's you know you're 11 years into

1199
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,039
it if you're a winery

1200
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:27,358
and that's just exactly been his his

1201
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,279
experiences that you know

1202
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,639
he invests a lot of money up front and

1203
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,400
then

1204
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:34,799
so finally it's starting to come back to

1205
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,960
him in the wine that he sold

1206
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,160
i don't know if that's a good answer but

1207
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,280
but

1208
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:41,039
yes

1209
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,200
so uh kind of

1210
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,800
the question in

1211
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:47,358
with two different um

1212
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,160
you know audiences one is when you talk

1213
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,358
to the grape growers about a practice

1214
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,759
that might have

1215
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:56,559
a positive environmental impact but not

1216
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,800
necessarily an economic one

1217
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,960
how are you talking to them about that

1218
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,640
and then the second part is that when

1219
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,400
you talk to the funders or work with the

1220
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,719
funding agencies

1221
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,838
how would you like them to

1222
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:11,279
assess

1223
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:11,279
positive environmental impacts

1224
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:14,399
yeah because you were just mentioned

1225
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,440
economics and that they just want to

1226
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,358
know yeah

1227
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,519
yeah but we know that there's a lot of

1228
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:21,519
positive we do a lot of work and show

1229
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:24,960
positive environmental impacts from our

1230
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:28,000
work how do we compare that back to the

1231
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,039
growers and to the funders

1232
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,519
uh

1233
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:33,119
well the growers are pretty easy to sell

1234
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:34,079
and uh

1235
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,039
on it

1236
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,240
actually

1237
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,920
uh because you know

1238
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:41,759
a lot of them like if you're on long

1239
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,760
island they say god i'm spending way too

1240
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,200
much time on my spare how do i get out

1241
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,720
of this you know

1242
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:48,000
and that might be new varieties that

1243
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,838
might be

1244
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,559
something

1245
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:52,719
else um

1246
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,318
i don't have any you know bad answers

1247
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,000
about this but uh

1248
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:57,679
but it's the growers that have been

1249
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,679
pushing us

1250
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,838
to do the environmental

1251
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:03,919
impact because they want to publicize

1252
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:07,358
the fact that they use cover crops they

1253
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,760
don't do any tillage et cetera et cetera

1254
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:12,000
so you know they're kind of pushing us

1255
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,880
in a way

1256
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,719
so it's not a hard sell

1257
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,720
getting them to think about it

1258
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,639
it's more tempting to soft pedal the

1259
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,639
parts that are you know

1260
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:25,199
maybe not so great

1261
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:28,318
uh with them

1262
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,960
uh with funders i think you just have to

1263
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:31,759
have a narrative that you tell them and

1264
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,519
uh

1265
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,599
yeah i don't see how we're gonna have

1266
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:37,119
any you know huge

1267
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,599
uh

1268
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,640
hard metrics that we're gonna be able to

1269
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,720
talk about

1270
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:47,838
with with those things i don't know

1271
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:47,838
whatever is just saying congratulations

1272
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,440
no questions perspective congratulations

1273
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:54,960
wow nice so so what comes next

1274
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,119
what do you think about what comes next

1275
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,519
for me yeah i mean you don't look around

1276
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,519
but do you have some ideas

1277
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,679
yeah well uh

1278
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,358
one thing i'm doing right now that i

1279
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:07,919
just started last week is i'm going to

1280
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:10,480
be a vineyard inspector for their

1281
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,800
third party sustainability program

1282
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,838
from the new york wine grape foundation

1283
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,280
and uh

1284
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:17,279
this has been fun

1285
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,839
so far because

1286
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,359
the last two years with kovid i've spent

1287
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:22,960
most of my time just sitting behind my

1288
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:24,799
computer and writing stuff and not

1289
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,599
seeing anybody so now i get to go out

1290
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,720
and

1291
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,760
you know

1292
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:31,519
talk to people and and find out uh what

1293
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,839
what they're doing

1294
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,440
and uh it's been interesting just in the

1295
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:37,838
first week i found out you know some

1296
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,679
people are doing great stuff some people

1297
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:40,480
are doing terrible stuff in parts of

1298
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:41,598
their

1299
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,358
uh

1300
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,519
operation you know for example i found a

1301
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:47,440
spray shed that had a bunch of squirrels

1302
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:49,599
living in it

1303
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,240
you know at one place and then another

1304
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,359
another one where they've gotten 75 cost

1305
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,879
sharing from

1306
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:58,719
from

1307
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:01,680
nrcs to build a just a wonderful

1308
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:03,838
spray spray facility so

1309
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:05,838
um so that's one of the things

1310
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,078
i like i'd like to stay involved

1311
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:10,639
somewhat with the industry because uh i

1312
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,200
have a lot of friends in the industry

1313
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:15,199
and uh and uh

1314
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,598
that's really the best part of been the

1315
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,598
best part of the job for me

1316
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,559
so i don't know what i'm gonna do marvin

1317
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:24,640
but i'm gonna do something

1318
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,319
so and elizabeth lamb would like to know

1319
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:28,400
so what advice would you give to an

1320
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:31,599
emerging extension specialist or someone

1321
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,039
interested in becoming one okay

1322
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,960
um

1323
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,800
my impression is

1324
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,358
make a good impression in the first two

1325
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,000
months

1326
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:44,960
get out and meet meet people

1327
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,920
because they always have a long memory

1328
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,199
so if they have a bad encounter

1329
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,119
that's what they're going to think about

1330
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:55,358
you for the rest of your career

1331
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,680
uh one of the keys for me was just

1332
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:58,960
starting in right away with these trials

1333
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:01,519
and uh

1334
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,559
and people would see me out there in my

1335
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:06,559
in the car hearts and you know out

1336
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,680
collecting stuff

1337
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,519
and uh

1338
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,159
that's when i realized okay i might not

1339
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,960
know how to fill up a sprayer

1340
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,639
but

1341
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,639
i know how to collect data

1342
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,079
analyze it write about it and that's

1343
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,079
what they

1344
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,000
really value from us so

1345
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,599
so that's my other piece of advice is go

1346
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,760
out and collect some data generate some

1347
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,640
knowledge yourself

1348
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,680
and

1349
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:33,679
uh

1350
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,399
i guess in my position i never had a

1351
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,879
problem

1352
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:41,519
getting faculty collaboration i mean

1353
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,200
i i always felt for my colleagues say in

1354
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,079
wisconsin or something where they were

1355
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:45,919
all

1356
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,680
