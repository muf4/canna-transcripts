1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,360
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,599
University our topic today is actually

3
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,399
around what a practitioner needs to

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,600
understand with regard to field safety

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,719
and there's a number of aspects to it

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,760
that I want to just highlight to really

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:27,038
give this subject a solid treatment I'd

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,800
have to spend a lot more time uh on each

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,080
individual aspect but I want to give you

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,120
an overview of the kinds of things you

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,000
need to think of and just really go for

12
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,238
the loow hanging fruit if you if you

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,280
don't if you're having a hard time

14
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:41,878
getting your arms around what is field

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,558
safety by the time I'm done you should

16
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,198
at least have a good understanding of

17
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,878
the things you need to have on hand to

18
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:52,640
make sure you're going to be successful

19
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:55,119
should this ever come into question for

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,198
you now when you think about the

21
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,718
intricacies of field safety there's two

22
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,320
components to it right you can have

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,879
field hardness that you're likely to

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,519
fall on and get hurt or you can have

25
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:12,319
high traction which oftentimes leads to

26
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,679
what we call non- contct injuries and

27
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,679
you can get knee and ankle injury so

28
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,520
we're talking about hardness that

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,759
causing con concussions and fractures

30
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,078
and tractions that are knee and Ankle

31
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,200
injuries and of course what I've done

32
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:29,000
here is look around the particular issue

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,680
and say what are the thing what are the

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,680
aspects of that hardness that involv the

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,360
soil and the grass what are the aspects

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,079
of that traction that involve the soil

37
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,118
and the grass and then you know the non-

38
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:42,798
contct football injury risk is one of

39
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,879
the things that we constantly will come

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,920
back to so we're worried about risk from

41
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:52,039
a perspective of hardness and traction

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,879
and for the purposes of my time with you

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,719
today I'm strictly going to talk about

44
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,560
surface hardness but I want you to

45
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,078
understand that there is a very

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,840
sophisticated aspect of of safety with

47
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:07,439
regard to

48
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:12,039
traction now in New York state we have a

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:15,719
law now that has been passed to protect

50
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:18,479
uh athletes at the Scholastic level from

51
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,519
D further damages from concussion there

52
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,199
the law the concussion management and

53
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:27,280
awareness act has now put into place a

54
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:28,759
series of uh steps and methods and

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,318
procedures and

56
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:35,840
diagnoses education plans that then

57
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:39,000
govern how when an a concussion is

58
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,878
suspected how it's diagnosed what kinds

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,039
of treatments are provided how long you

60
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:48,318
have to be away from the sport this has

61
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:52,439
become a very very very important aspect

62
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:54,598
of Athletics at the Scholastic level and

63
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,840
what's been fascinating to me is in this

64
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:59,318
entire act that I've read at length

65
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,439
there's virtually nothing about field

66
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:04,759
safety there's nothing about field

67
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:07,359
hardness it's really all about sort of

68
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:10,079
determining was a concussion happening

69
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,159
and um you know what do you do with the

70
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,519
athlete nothing about was it caused by

71
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:18,519
some sort of malfeasance on the field so

72
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,640
I'm drawing your attention to this

73
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,759
particular act because I think it's not

74
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,399
going to be long that there's an aspect

75
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,878
of this act that's going to impact the

76
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,039
way we manage our field so just like the

77
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:31,798
child safe playing field Act that is

78
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,798
governing whether we can use pesticides

79
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:35,640
or not uh that we can't use pesticides

80
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,000
on school grounds this concussion

81
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,598
management act right now it does not

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,680
have strict legislation regarding field

83
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:46,238
management but it could

84
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,040
eventually now there's a number of

85
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,480
papers that have looked at field in

86
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,560
injury associated with the field it's

87
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:57,438
typically done by medical professionals

88
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,680
Sports Medicine doctors uh sort of

89
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,479
epidemiologists people who study sort of

90
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,159
spread of disease and injury and things

91
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:07,158
like that and a lot of times it's

92
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:09,639
related to surveillance systems uh NCAA

93
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:11,798
or High School athletics has an injury

94
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,679
surveillance system that they look for

95
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,120
where the injuries occurred now the

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,918
other aspect of this that's very

97
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,798
important is the field quality and often

98
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:24,560
times there's a disconnect between the

99
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:27,239
injuries that are reported and the

100
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,120
quality of the field now this particular

101
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,120
study published in the American Journal

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:38,120
sports in 2004 looked at 250 games over

103
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,600
a 5-year period in high school sports

104
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,759
they looked at natural Turf which they

105
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,960
didn't characterize the quality of that

106
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:50,479
natural Turf and field Turf which is a

107
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:53,120
um a particular brand of Synthetic

108
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,918
infill Turf where you have the fibers

109
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,399
and the rubber now I don't know that

110
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:58,279
anything is specific and there's some

111
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,319
sort of controversy between the field

112
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:03,159
Turf people and this study but for now

113
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,599
it's a good indication I use this

114
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,400
because it's a good indication of the

115
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,680
things that actually will and could

116
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,519
happen now you have total injuries

117
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,478
injury rate per team game you've got

118
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,240
substantial injury and severe injury so

119
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,240
substantial injury is you miss a couple

120
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,800
of games severe injury is you miss

121
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,918
months maybe even the whole season now

122
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,960
if you look at the differences between a

123
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,038
natural Turf system and a Synthetic Turf

124
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:30,279
system the first thing you'll notice is

125
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:32,719
that the Synthetic Turf system has a

126
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:36,318
higher percentage of total injuries

127
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,840
occurring on Synthetic Turf however when

128
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,080
you look a little more closely you see

129
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:45,198
that the severe injury ratings on

130
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:49,120
natural Turf is much higher than it is

131
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,879
on Synthetic Turf so while you get more

132
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,120
common injuries on field Turf and

133
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,879
they're primarily epidermal rashes rug

134
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,639
Burns and some muscle

135
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,319
strains the concussions as we indicated

136
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,120
a minute ago uh is what we are focusing

137
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,199
on here in New York and maybe field

138
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,160
hardness is much more common on natural

139
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,639
Turf now here's where the tricky part

140
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,800
comes it's entirely possible that these

141
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,199
fields were in terrible shape because

142
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,478
one of the things we know is if you've

143
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,680
got grass you're likely to have a more

144
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,839
cushioned surface so there could be

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,160
these fields that they're playing on May

146
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,959
have a significant amount of bare ground

147
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,160
exposed which could lead to these

148
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,799
concussions so so just so that you

149
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,759
wonder oh you know do I have to about

150
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,400
one surface or the other from a safety

151
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,439
perspective they each each surface has

152
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,959
their concerns the concussions on the

153
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,319
natural field and the epidermal

154
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,598
abrasions on the field Turf now why

155
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,280
would you well it's just a rug burn why

156
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:47,680
is that a problem well the rug burn is

157
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,318
in fact a serious wound where blood

158
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,918
vessels can be exposed and athletes that

159
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,400
then go into sweaty whirlpools or sweaty

160
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,758
weight rooms or or go back into the

161
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,198
locker room and start touching things

162
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,960
with an open wound the potential for MCA

163
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,919
methylin resistance stafilic cacus orus

164
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,519
this sort of lethal fatal disease that

165
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,038
can happen to people that can they can

166
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,478
contract in those situations is very

167
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,918
common where you get a lot of these rug

168
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,519
burs so basically the solution to that

169
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:20,159
is not to spray the field with

170
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:24,159
disinfectant because that's not the

171
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,400
issue the issue is to treat the wound

172
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,599
keep it clean hygiene is the primary way

173
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:32,439
you avoid any further problems from from

174
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,759
this so just an overview of because you

175
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:36,560
get a lot of question about natural

176
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,319
synthetic it's an overview of this

177
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,280
issue okay so let's look a little bit on

178
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,879
Synthetic Turf

179
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,918
safety if we're just honing on Synthetic

180
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,560
Turf because I'm going to spend most of

181
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:48,279
my time talking about natural Turf but I

182
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,280
want to make a point here on Synthetic

183
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:53,079
Turf there's two additional health

184
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,000
concerns on Synthetic Turf you need to

185
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:57,878
be aware of one is that there's been a

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
long time concern about the presence of

187
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,879
chemicals in these products

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,560
lead in the paint that they're making

189
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,039
lead in the plastic that the Synthetic

190
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,800
Turf is made out of and also

191
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:10,079
contaminants in the rubber that makes up

192
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,280
the infill but the fact is the body of

193
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,639
research done shows done with this and

194
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,679
and a lot of it was done by the New York

195
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,439
State Department of Environmental

196
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,400
Conservation has done a thorough review

197
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,079
of this and you can go to the dec

198
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,758
website and see that report which is you

199
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:25,918
know mostly very in-depth deep than

200
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,360
science that I barely have can

201
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,359
understand but the the conclusion was

202
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,320
that there's minimal health effects

203
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,440
related to the chemicals used in the

204
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,839
Synthetic Turf process but the other one

205
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,839
that's real is the heat on an 80 to 85

206
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,479
Degree bright sunny day temperatures on

207
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:46,200
the Synthetic Turf system reached

208
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,680
between 120 and 146 to put this in

209
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,879
perspective you can fry an egg at

210
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:53,879
152 so this kind of safety is a serious

211
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,799
problem imagine you're playing on a

212
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,240
summer day on a synthetic turf field and

213
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,000
someone gets injured and then has to lay

214
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,600
on that field with waiting for

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,200
assistance about 5 or 10 minutes on a

216
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,759
Surface that's 140° will create first

217
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,640
and second degree burns of the skin if

218
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,399
their skin exposed so you want to be

219
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,360
very careful generally what we say is

220
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,679
Synthetic Turf in Northern climates is

221
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,200
ideal for the shoulders of the season

222
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:22,399
the spring Sports and the late fall

223
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,399
sports are good to play on these systems

224
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,720
when the grass is no longer growing but

225
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,120
when the grass starts growing in the

226
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,480
summer months and you know the heat is

227
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,679
building on there you best stay off of

228
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,240
them because water uh will decrease the

229
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,919
temperature but temperature increased

230
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,639
back up to 90 to 120 within 30 minutes

231
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,639
so the heat is a serious concern with

232
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,759
Synthetic

233
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,278
Turf now when we're talking about

234
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,439
hardness and we're going to talk a lot

235
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:51,120
about hardness um of these systems you

236
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,680
have to understand the way we look at

237
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,440
this basically if you look at this as a

238
00:09:53,679 --> 00:10:01,439
head when it's dropped okay if the

239
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,880
surface is is hard and not sort of

240
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,440
receiving of the D of the of the weight

241
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:09,679
the energy the downward energy is then

242
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,920
reverberated back into the head and this

243
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:16,439
is where the damage can occur however

244
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:18,399
when you have a softer surface right and

245
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,200
you drop your head or fall on the

246
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:25,120
surface the energy in that dropping is

247
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,160
dispersed into the turf rather than back

248
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,078
into the head that leads to the

249
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:32,799
concussion so this is an example of how

250
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,519
a ground could cause a

251
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:39,799
concussion now we have very particular

252
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:43,078
ways and standardized methods ASM

253
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:44,838
standards for how field hardness or

254
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:47,199
Surface hardness is assessed now this

255
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,440
was started many many years ago in the

256
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,959
80s there was some re research at

257
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,240
Michigan State that looked at how to

258
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,000
determine field hardness and they

259
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,959
borrowed some technology from the

260
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,200
pavement industry to see how firm the

261
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,199
pavement is they used to drop a

262
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,839
specified weight down from a known

263
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,800
height and measure hardness and then

264
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,920
they adapted Turf scientists adapted

265
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,120
that particular um method of measuring

266
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,278
surface hardness into Turf which has

267
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:19,120
then led to the f355 standard and the

268
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,439
F-1 1936 standard um that basically

269
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,480
tells you if you're going to measure

270
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,079
surface hardness this is the way you

271
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,680
have to do you have to have a consistent

272
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,679
way of doing it so that the measurements

273
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,399
all mean the same and then we ultimately

274
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:36,000
report it and you'll hear it often times

275
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:37,519
referred to as gmax testing now gmax

276
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
testing assesses the risk of

277
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,959
lifethreatening head injuries it does

278
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,078
not assess the risk of bone or joint

279
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:48,759
injuries which could occur but right now

280
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:51,638
we're focusing on head injuries and so

281
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,399
impact testing as a concept is a weight

282
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,959
is dropped onto the surface and the

283
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,120
shock of the impact is measured as

284
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:01,479
negative acceleration so you drop the

285
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,879
hammer down this tube this is a very

286
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,639
sophisticated gmax device 20 G for

287
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,720
something like this you drop it and

288
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,799
following the method and then the rate

289
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,360
at which it decelerates or stops is an

290
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,639
indication of how the energy is

291
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,240
transferred back into the head or the

292
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,240
hammer and then that is reported as

293
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,039
gravities and the gmax is maximum

294
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,320
deceleration the higher the value the

295
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:30,759
harder the surface now there's two ways

296
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,000
of doing this the kle hammer was the

297
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:35,480
original way that was designed by the

298
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,679
turf scientist to sort of look at field

299
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,600
hardness now what's not been well

300
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:42,000
established in this country and I'll

301
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,560
I'll show you some data from Australia

302
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,600
in a minute is can you correlate the

303
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,239
drop of this particular device to the

304
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,159
risk of head

305
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,039
injury now a different device the gmax

306
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:59,799
testing that follows the F-1

307
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:02,838
1936 uses a 20 pound weight which may be

308
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:06,159
more simulating what a head would do um

309
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:10,240
and the the shape of it is concave like

310
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:12,958
that um so the the the CLE is for the

311
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,079
natural Turf but not well correlated you

312
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,679
can't substitute this for the gmax and

313
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,359
there's some sense of there are people

314
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:22,000
that are trying to do it but you have to

315
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,120
be very careful so here's the two

316
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
devices that they use to measure this

317
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,159
now again this is only an accepted

318
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,799
method for Synthetic Turf and here's the

319
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,519
setup this is the $20,000 setup that you

320
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,759
get where you lift the hammer and then

321
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,278
the reason this is an accepted method is

322
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,919
it tells you did you drop the hammer

323
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:47,120
right is it moving at the right speed

324
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:49,919
there's a number of quality controls

325
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,639
that this system does that you can't

326
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,240
with the simpler kle Hammer that I'll

327
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,519
show you in a second 20 lb missile drop

328
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,360
from 2 feet you drop it three times and

329
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,600
the second two readings are average so

330
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,199
the very very specific way that field

331
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,639
hardness is tested now if you have a

332
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,278
Synthetic Turf how often should you test

333
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,799
it now first of all when you buy a

334
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:12,759
Synthetic Turf and it's new you want to

335
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,399
do it and establish a baseline because

336
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:18,159
if the contractor leaves the site and

337
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:21,958
leaves you with a field that is already

338
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,600
too high and unsafe you have no recourse

339
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:26,559
so make sure first of all you get it in

340
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,480
the spec that the field has to be built

341
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,198
so that when a gmax test is done at the

342
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,720
end it reads a number this or lower all

343
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:36,240
right so F certainly to establish a

344
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,759
Baseline and also to make sure you got

345
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,320
what you're paid for and then annually

346
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,159
thereafter on heavily used Fields so you

347
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,480
say heavily used Fields wait a minute I

348
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:48,078
got Synthetic Turf yeah Synthetic Turf

349
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,000
wears out the infill moves for those of

350
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,278
you that play lacrosse on the Synthetic

351
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,320
Turf you know that the gold mouth is

352
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:56,958
constantly having the rubber pushed away

353
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,759
and the fibers degraded and you'll often

354
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,359
and almost always get a much higher

355
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,320
reading by the go mouth than you will

356
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,879
away from the gold mouth because the

357
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:11,240
rubber compacts or wears away and

358
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:14,480
therefore the surface becomes harder so

359
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:17,600
annually on heavy use fields and then if

360
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,920
you have reports of a serious head

361
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,680
injury and the field is implicated go ra

362
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:25,078
you know immediately find someone in the

363
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,078
private sector and there's a number of

364
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,719
people particularly Dr hmel at Hummel

365
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:33,078
and company that can go and do this gmax

366
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,560
testing for you to create a body of

367
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:39,399
evidence that you may need in a legal

368
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,439
case now let's talk about natural Turf

369
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,559
no one would argue certainly being on

370
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,440
natural Turf uh on a summer day would be

371
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:49,039
preferable uh but certainly a

372
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,199
well-maintained grass field uh can be

373
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,559
safe or a well-maintained synthetic

374
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,399
field can be

375
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:58,799
safe if you're going to maintain a cool

376
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:01,198
season turf field and you're worried

377
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,039
about liability and risk management as a

378
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,838
school board member in a local community

379
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,838
here I I am concerned about that one

380
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,360
place to start is that there is an ASM

381
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,600
standard for maintaining cool season

382
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,800
Turf on athletic fields it's uh

383
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,278
f260 and this is a document you should

384
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:22,879
have you should understand should have a

385
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:25,958
basic knowledge of you know what's in

386
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,838
here and am I following and doing my due

387
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,119
diligence so this is number one

388
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,079
something you should have and also in a

389
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,519
more plain English approach to what's

390
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:36,198
involved in a safe field that you might

391
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,440
give to coaches and players and

392
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:40,719
community members administrators is

393
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,560
something that the sports turf managers

394
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,160
have developed a foundation for safer

395
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:49,879
athletic fields has a whole four or five

396
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,480
page very in plain English natural grass

397
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,198
athletic fields for safety and I have

398
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,959
the website there but you can go to

399
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:59,838
stma.org and access this

400
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:02,758
document now when you get involved in

401
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,959
the legal end of this process you have

402
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,519
to sort of learn some jargon and one of

403
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:11,439
the most important parts words in jargon

404
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:15,279
and field safety to see how involved you

405
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,679
may be is the duty of care a duty of

406
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,399
care is a legal obligation on an

407
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,079
individual organization required that

408
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,519
they adhere to a standard of reasonable

409
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:28,639
care reasonable

410
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:32,119
care this would be considered reason

411
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,520
able care so get this learn this it's

412
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:37,159
very generic it ought to be something

413
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:39,359
you can easily commit to doing

414
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,400
reasonable care we performing any acts

415
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,839
that could be could foreseeably harm

416
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,480
others right are you leaving rocks

417
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,199
Exposed on the fields it is the first

418
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,240
element that must be established to

419
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,038
proceed with action and negligence so

420
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,000
let's imagine an athlete is using your

421
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:58,558
field and falls and hits their head and

422
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,679
there's no grass there and someone

423
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,200
realizes that person's concussed and

424
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,679
they are going to seek remediation for

425
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,080
the damage that might have been done to

426
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,480
that child or adult on that field the

427
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,639
first thing they're going to do when you

428
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,200
get a lawyer involved is their

429
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,038
negligence and negligence could then be

430
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,000
established if you weren't taking

431
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:23,640
reasonable

432
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,119
care now let's look at potential risks

433
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,280
now this is from um a cfers and beard

434
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,558
publication from the late this is one of

435
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,440
the foremost turf grass scientists in

436
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:36,759
the United States dropped the kle hammer

437
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,320
on a number of different surfaces all

438
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:41,000
right where a cement floor was as much

439
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:44,599
as 1,400

440
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,919
G's uh the a football outdoor for your

441
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:48,279
artificial

442
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,280
175 you know you don't think about this

443
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:53,440
but in tennis if you fall and hit your

444
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:55,839
head that can't be good basketball court

445
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,120
that's not going to be good baseball

446
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:01,678
natural Turf Bermuda grass field so you

447
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:04,439
can can see very hard to

448
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,280
softer what's not well understood and

449
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,159
not well established in this country is

450
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,158
what how does this correlate to head

451
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,440
injury they've got it for the gmax

452
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:15,960
testing they don't have it for the CLE

453
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,558
Hammer

454
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,319
yet now as we're talking about legal

455
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,079
things that's the kind of data that a

456
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:25,439
good lawyer is going to start pulling

457
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,519
out and so as a school district as a

458
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,919
member of a school board I am constantly

459
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,798
mindful of

460
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,480
the management of risk in a school

461
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:36,639
district whether it's how a teacher

462
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,440
manages their classroom it's how what

463
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,080
kind of cleaning products we use to

464
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,798
clean the bathrooms to all the way to

465
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:46,439
how the fields are kept so from a risk

466
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:50,119
management perspective knowing that

467
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,200
field use with that wears out the

468
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:53,798
centers of these fields often you can

469
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,000
see the wearing out

470
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:59,119
here knowing that that's one of the

471
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,200
primary ways the turf gets less safe is

472
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,158
do we have enough space for the amount

473
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,519
of use that we have is the space

474
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,400
appropriate for the type of use for

475
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:11,440
example you know here's a lacrosse field

476
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,640
are they going to be all right playing

477
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,759
lacrosse on a little bit of dirt skin

478
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,440
here is it appropriate for that use and

479
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,798
is the space managed properly do you

480
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,600
have enough room is it appropriate to

481
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:26,200
play that sport

482
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,959
there and are you managing it properly

483
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,798
so those are the things I'm thinking

484
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,919
about out when I'm thinking about moving

485
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:34,440
further with regard to this now one way

486
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,080
to get your arms around this is for

487
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,120
communities led by the groundskeeper

488
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:41,439
with a board of education or Community

489
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,719
Sports people to go out and assess the

490
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,720
field now we developed a tool many many

491
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,240
years ago that's very simple for the

492
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,640
average person to fill out if the

493
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,120
grounds manager is there that grounds

494
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,200
manager can answer a question about

495
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:59,319
whether it's the field is watered how

496
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,880
much fertilizer they put on

497
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:05,879
what the mowing height

498
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:08,000
is and that's it everything else can be

499
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,278
answered by a lay person that might use

500
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,480
the field and then you get a number by

501
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:16,119
answering these things so here is a

502
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,120
Hector soccer field where we rated these

503
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:22,239
numbers and it came out with a 31 and

504
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:25,079
we're saying if you get between 21 and

505
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,319
35 you should reassess your management

506
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:29,399
program unless the quality you expect is

507
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,678
less than three but you've got to wonder

508
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,038
from a safety perspective whether that

509
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,519
field is at risk so if you're over 35

510
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,319
you've got to think about renovating

511
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:42,000
those fields if you're under 21 you're

512
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:43,678
doing pretty good so this this uh Travis

513
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,359
High School football is obviously doing

514
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,919
pretty good so an easy way to get

515
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:51,119
everybody on the same page and have a

516
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,679
conversation about the fields as you're

517
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,879
thinking about risk

518
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,720
management

519
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,159
now no one's going to argue

520
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,200
that a grass field is really good when

521
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:06,240
there's grass but in fact there's data

522
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,278
to support

523
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,038
this it starts out first of all by

524
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:14,000
understanding your soil this is the

525
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,798
amount of fine particles so when you go

526
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,278
from here you're probably talking about

527
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:22,720
a high sand content all the way up to a

528
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:25,038
really clay soil along the bottom here

529
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,000
and this is the hardness of that

530
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:33,319
field all right so when you dry that

531
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,440
soil down right you can see without any

532
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:38,678
grass

533
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,038
cover without any grass cover as you add

534
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:44,880
more clay particles if you have a clay

535
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:48,440
soil field without any grass cover you

536
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,400
can see how hard it gets as it dries out

537
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,080
the more clay you

538
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,480
add and then

539
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:58,960
however when you have 100% grass cover

540
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,679
you can see that the grass

541
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,319
mitigates the hardness so what's the

542
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,440
message here well I'm trying to give you

543
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:08,798
really simple things the simplest thing

544
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,240
is if you have a natural grass field

545
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:14,158
make sure you've got vegetation I'm

546
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,640
going to say vegetation because we think

547
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,400
generally broadleaf weeds are not as

548
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,200
traffic tolerant we're still getting

549
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,038
some more data we've had some new data

550
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,840
from Tennessee that's indicating they

551
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:25,919
don't hold up as well they wear out much

552
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,319
more quickly and that's a problem

553
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,400
because you want to have a great grast

554
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,960
or vegetated Surface to mitigate the

555
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,679
hardness here especially for those of

556
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,720
you without irrigation as The Field's

557
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,159
going to dry out more now I spent a

558
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,759
little time in Australia this past year

559
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,760
and traveled around looking at sports

560
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:47,079
fields and number of conversations with

561
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:49,440
the grounds industry over there and they

562
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,960
actually have guidelines that they've

563
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,759
developed from a number of studies

564
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,720
conducted in Australia on Australian

565
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:58,480
Rules football fields because they play

566
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,400
Australian Rules Football

567
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,919
which is this sort of gayc football

568
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,120
rugby soccer thing it's they play on a

569
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,799
huge field there's 17 guys on a side

570
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,678
they're very no equipment it's shorts

571
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:15,599
and a t-shirt that's it and they've

572
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:18,000
actually developed a system using the

573
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,240
CLE which we right now in the states

574
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,759
have not adopted but this is what they

575
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,759
have done in Australia where they're

576
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:28,519
grading it as too

577
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:33,519
low all the way to

578
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:37,038
unsafe okay so it's safe is between 31

579
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:40,240
and 69 the preferred range is between 70

580
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:42,960
and 89 now they're also measuring this

581
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,480
with related related to traction as much

582
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,200
as field hardness that you could hit

583
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,038
your head on so that's probably why the

584
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,798
preferable range is good here and this

585
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:54,519
is considered unsafe because the

586
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:56,519
traction is probably really bad it's too

587
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,480
soft so you can have a field that's too

588
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,158
soft and you see that with Muddy Fields

589
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,200
an ideal field and a field that's too

590
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,360
too hard all right again we have not

591
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,840
adopted this but these are good values

592
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:12,759
to just sort of start with now if we can

593
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:15,959
agree that grass is good just having

594
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:18,119
this so soil covered is good then we've

595
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,679
got to think about how to maintain that

596
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:23,359
cover because overuse will result in

597
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:27,320
Failure so what we want to do if that

598
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:29,359
fail point is usually you know over here

599
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:32,599
we want to move that fail Point further

600
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:35,240
over so that the turf can sustain itself

601
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:36,959
longer and one of the things we've done

602
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,038
with this is some of our work with

603
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,759
intense overseeding where we're

604
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,879
overseeding on a weekly basis during the

605
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:47,240
traffic period light frequent amounts of

606
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,840
seed thrown on a regular basis to

607
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,480
maintain Turf

608
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,678
cover where normally the traffic would

609
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,880
wear out the turf to this so you're

610
00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:00,360
talking about is this safer than this I

611
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,919
can't say specifically but in general we

612
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,959
know the more grass you have the safer

613
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,159
that Field's going to be so here's the

614
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,919
study we did we took this field we moted

615
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:12,039
at 3 in we traffic the equivalent of

616
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,360
five games between the 20 and between

617
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:17,359
the hash mark so lots of traffic there

618
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:20,398
was no water we watered we we fertiliz

619
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,038
twice a year we used a drop spreader

620
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:24,839
because the soil is

621
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:27,679
exposed from the traffic so you to get

622
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:28,959
good so seed contact under high traffic

623
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,640
you don't have to Slit seed in fact

624
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,919
several Studies have shown slit seeding

625
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,960
makes it worse because slit seed starts

626
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,759
to dig things up and then you've got Ry

627
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,519
grass Blu grass and tall fescue now

628
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,359
here's the only two pieces of data that

629
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,519
I'm going to show you we did this over a

630
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,038
threeyear

631
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:50,278
period and the rainfall amount in the

632
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:55,038
first year was 20% below normal so here

633
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:56,599
is the treatment 2 48 and or 10 pounds

634
00:26:55,038 --> 00:27:00,720
of seed per

635
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:03,319
thousand this is Turf density 20% Turf

636
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,880
density which means the grass is not

637
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:08,319
very much 85% means you have a lot more

638
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,480
grass and then in a dry year weed

639
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,000
density you didn't see a big difference

640
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,319
in the amount of weeds that invaded

641
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,359
because there was no water for the weeds

642
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,000
to grow we looked at Turf quality which

643
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,839
I'm not going to worry about and we look

644
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,440
at gmax which I'm not necessarily going

645
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:23,839
to talk about but essentially you notice

646
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,240
as you go from 20% Turf

647
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:32,038
cover at 130 gmax down to 85 % Turf

648
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,759
cover at 55 that the turf gets softer

649
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:37,839
now this was true for both perennial Ry

650
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:40,000
grass and for tall fescue this did not

651
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,639
work for Kentucky Bluegrass because it

652
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
takes much longer for the Kentucky

653
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,120
bluegrass seed to Germany so fast

654
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,480
germinating plants like penal Ry and

655
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:50,599
tall fescue will work fine now the

656
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,798
second two years of the study did the

657
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:55,319
exact same thing but we got regular

658
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,558
rainfall matter of fact above average

659
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:59,918
rainfall and what you see is what

660
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:02,918
because of the traffic without any

661
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:06,799
seeding there's no Turf left lots of

662
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:12,000
weeds no Turf just a little bit of seed

663
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:16,079
2 lbs per thousand per week gave us

664
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,200
85% gave us 85% Turf density and did a

665
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,599
really good job of controlling weeds

666
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,080
Turf quality was excellent and field

667
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,959
firmness or field hardness was much

668
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,359
lower so when you have you know if you

669
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,880
have the if there's going to be rainfall

670
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:32,278
you have to be able to irrigate as

671
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,080
little as 2 L pounds of seed can be

672
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:37,679
enough to turn a field from a disaster

673
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:40,240
into a safer field because I can tell

674
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,480
you if a kid gets hurt on a field that

675
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,159
looks like this they're going to come

676
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,599
after someone for reasonable

677
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:49,519
care so let's look at this if you're

678
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:52,719
looking at an American football field

679
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:56,000
you're looking at between the hash marks

680
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,640
and between the 20 yard lines that's

681
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,919
where 80% % of the traffic in an

682
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,200
American football field occurs between

683
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:05,640
the 20s and between the hash marks

684
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,000
that's your high traffic

685
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,559
area let's go through the economics

686
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,319
people say oh my God throw seed every

687
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:15,639
week how you going to do that well let's

688
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:17,278
go to the two pound rate per thousand so

689
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,120
let's say we're putting out 2 pounds per

690
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,759
thousand assume a125 per pound some

691
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:27,398
people can get it cheaper so that's a

692
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:29,839
weekly cost of $2.50 a th000 that area

693
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:33,959
between the 20s between the hash is

694
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:37,199
16,000 Square ft so assuming these seed

695
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,440
rates cost of seed weekly cost per

696
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,360
thousand multiplied by the area that

697
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,919
you're going to treat it's $40 a week

698
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:47,158
for

699
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,399
seed let's say you did it 13 weeks in

700
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,840
the fall and 13 weeks in the spring

701
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:54,959
soccer or football in the fall lacrosse

702
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:59,119
in the spring that's 26 weeks it'd be

703
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,360
$1,000 in seed costs so it's not a

704
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:04,479
burden for most even small school

705
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:07,678
districts like mine could afford $1,000

706
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,640
receed now here's an example of a trial

707
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,159
we did in the Albany area Dave chinery

708
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,799
our extension faculty in the Capitol

709
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,320
district has done a lot of work with

710
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:18,359
this repetitive over seating and this is

711
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:20,599
one of his trials where they had played

712
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:22,759
football played football on it did the

713
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:24,759
over seating and then left it for the

714
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:27,798
next year they didn't do it again and

715
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:29,640
you can see in these plots

716
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:31,558
where they overseeded and where they

717
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,080
didn't where they didn't this is loaded

718
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:35,599
with crab grass and where they did

719
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,199
there's very little weeds growing in

720
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,798
there at all so obviously there can be

721
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,759
some weed control associated with that

722
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:44,200
now another way to get a safe field

723
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,798
especially if you're you know really in

724
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,600
a pinch and have to get that field in

725
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:49,798
shape really quickly which what the

726
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,759
professional athletes do and there's a

727
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:54,440
shot at a professional stadium with the

728
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,919
installation of what we call thick cut

729
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,679
sod where normally sod would be cut

730
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,799
between between a half and 3/4 of an

731
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:05,278
inch here you're talking about an inch

732
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:09,000
and a half to 2 in of soil underneath so

733
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:11,079
it's a very very heavy s so that when

734
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,519
you lay it you can play right on it

735
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:15,199
immediately because it won't move well

736
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,200
people say oh how how can we do that

737
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,639
well thick cut s is roughly 60 cents a

738
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:26,000
square foot your go mouth area that's

739
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:29,119
bare here is roughly 10 by 10 all right

740
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,919
60 cents a sareet foot by 100t gold

741
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,918
mouth area

742
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:36,159
$60 and you could do it a number of

743
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,919
times that it's always going to be safe

744
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,159
for those athletes there so many people

745
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:44,080
have started to consider this because we

746
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:47,799
know that having grass is the key the

747
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:49,439
first step to making that fi safer I'll

748
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:51,879
turn your attention back to this

749
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,440
standard that this is the minimum that

750
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,120
you should be doing you got to get your

751
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,159
hands on this and understand what's

752
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,000
involved in it and then simply Focus

753
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:04,120
focus on keeping the use to a level you

754
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,798
can manage and then try Innovative

755
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:07,839
things like the regular over seating to

756
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:09,879
keep that grass in place because that

757
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,879
natural Turf surface that has the grass

758
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,240
on it is always going to be a safer

759
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,159
surface in general than bare soil and

760
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,638
then the synthetic and natural Turf

761
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,240
debate is going to continue with no real

762
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:24,519
clear answers until we get our arms

763
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,638
around exactly um how we can use the kle

764
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,919
values in natural Turf so I hope I gave

765
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:30,759
you a little little bit of an overview

766
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:32,919
of this particular topic I know you're

767
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:35,158
going to have a a lot more time to

768
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:37,960
discuss this over the course of the day

769
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,960
and thanks for the

770
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:46,558
time this has been a production of
