1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:09,480
University I know you're prepared you've

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,429
been at this for a while oh yeah to hear

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,820
that you guys have been working on the

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:17,129
flame and stuff for all we're all in

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,289
we've been alright so we just started on

7
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:22,768
that a few months ago and we're seeing

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,900
some really cool stuff it seems like the

9
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:27,598
most stupid thing in the world to go out

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,479
and scorch all of the turf but when you

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,000
see how dramatically and how rapidly the

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,920
turf recovers but you get this

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,189
selectivity between certain weeds and

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,899
not especially like seedling control you

15
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:42,209
can be even less aggressive on the flame

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:46,469
get the job done your recovery is even

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,450
faster I mean it's a huge thing timing I

18
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,009
think one of the things we're seeing

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,600
with Chris's work out at the vineyard

20
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,009
and as soon as you know life gets

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,489
somewhere back to normal we would get

22
00:00:53,009 --> 00:01:00,869
you out there to see we did like a early

23
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:02,788
post flame on crabgrass we saw some

24
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:05,368
early seedlings coming up out there and

25
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,489
we went out with a very quick burn he

26
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:11,938
wasn't driving very slow at all and man

27
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:15,079
did it provide here st. controls season

28
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,938
long I think it's the seen rain Shawn I

29
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:21,780
think we might be taking out that seed

30
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:24,118
rain at the top and the grass is just

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,509
getting going it's the best time for it

32
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,780
to regrow and your colleague only liked

33
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,469
it on phrase mowing that Juvenal turf

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,659
that new tissue coming up that's much

35
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:40,048
more aggressive than sort of mature

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,729
plodding along yeah it actually helped

37
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,549
in long-term it helps your overall

38
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:46,438
quality of building because it gives the

39
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,659
turf room to grow it gets rid of all the

40
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,989
old stems and sticks and stuff and you

41
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,280
know it's pretty cool it's even telling

42
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:55,019
prevalent for one season grasses are

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,280
stolen if Chris grass is where you just

44
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:57,569
need to get rid of a line that old stand

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,170
material that's right and I think

46
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:03,779
further it's not just about dead

47
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,930
material but I wonder if this same

48
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:11,159
dramatic defoliation whether it's phrase

49
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:13,620
mowing burning final sand clove oil

50
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:18,150
whatever organic burned

51
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:21,780
waipuna foaming whatever it is I think

52
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,870
that timing of that defoliation not so

53
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,330
much what kind it is but the timing may

54
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,140
be more critical than actually the way

55
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,140
you do it

56
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:33,929
but I'm guessing yeah yeah well we're

57
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,518
definitely seeing there are certain we'd

58
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,989
speed so we're looking at all the

59
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,030
different turf types and then we also

60
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,980
have a couple of sites that have just a

61
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,128
smorgasbord of weeds and so we're

62
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:48,328
looking at how different durations of

63
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:51,598
flame per unit area and at some point I

64
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:54,450
want to figure out what we're doing in

65
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,429
BTUs because one one of the issues you

66
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:58,979
know like prevailing atmospheric

67
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,469
conditions ground moisture all that

68
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:04,139
could factor in well anyway we're seeing

69
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:06,658
huge differences in plant response

70
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,639
species response like we're that

71
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:11,189
threshold or where that cliff will be

72
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,529
between one weed or another if you're

73
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:14,989
talking a half of a minute one minute

74
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,000
two minutes three minutes whatever

75
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:20,370
wherever that non-return cliff is from

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,659
one species versus another is vastly

77
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,079
different so we're seeing a lot of

78
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:27,120
species separation what makes it work is

79
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,239
the rapid turf recovery in almost all

80
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,219
cases we're getting acceptable turf

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,799
quality back in a week

82
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:38,009
and I was in the salt and I'm talking

83
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,500
from Black scorched I mean there's

84
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:42,388
nothing left but ashes in one week later

85
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,000
we've got pretty darn good looking turf

86
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,040
and cool season warm season cool season

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,259
well and I'm referencing cool season

88
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,358
right now our warm season work right now

89
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:53,818
is kind of spring and we're finding out

90
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,889
as with herbicides during green oats not

91
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,328
a good time to come out and burn warm

92
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,159
season turf it probably should have been

93
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:02,849
done during dormancy when the stuffs

94
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:08,519
asleep anyway Bert we're gonna burn it

95
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:10,318
we're gonna if they thought pesticide

96
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,569
odor or drift was a problem wait till we

97
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:18,060
start burning everything really pissed

98
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:19,889
about that yeah so I will just introduce

99
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,959
everybody here today thanks everybody

100
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,310
for joining I know zoom kind of updated

101
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,408
here in the last week now we have a

102
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,660
password you know hopefully I got that

103
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:29,550
out in time for some people to join

104
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,050
but I guess today as we've been talking

105
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,810
about a little earlier you've heard that

106
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,970
dr. Shawn askew from Virginia Tech he's

107
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,470
here today we'll talk about polis and

108
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,030
it's a new pull of products that were

109
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,040
really excited about we've already

110
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,469
talked about burning as a method of weed

111
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,600
control so we I'm sure we'll get more

112
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,340
into that but as always we'll start with

113
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,590
dr. Frank Rossi Frank and give us a

114
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:51,089
little update where we been the past two

115
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,009
weeks at least in the northeast here and

116
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,529
then we'll get to the conversation yeah

117
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:58,039
big thanks to Shawn thanks Carl

118
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:02,129
big thanks to Shawn can you hear me okay

119
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:04,650
yeah yeah okay big thanks to Shawn for

120
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:06,389
joining us and of course big shout to my

121
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:08,639
pal Carl who's put up with me for the

122
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,740
last a couple of months anybody who has

123
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,500
to put up with me on a regular basis

124
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,110
like this is deserves a medal somewhere

125
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,720
and I have to say it's heartwarming I

126
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,879
like to start out with a picture I find

127
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,980
you know blowing around Twitter Twitter

128
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,129
when I'm not watching professor I ask

129
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:30,860
you devise country songs to the control

130
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:35,459
of weeds and other things the the real I

131
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,900
have to say widespread return of golf

132
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,639
course superintendents bringing their

133
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:40,589
families to the golf course and taking

134
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,019
pictures of it being really proud of it

135
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:44,699
and celebrating and I know this is

136
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,139
particularly warm to Carl's heart

137
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,409
because they're sitting by the side of

138
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:52,229
the green eating chick-fil-a your

139
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,939
favorite food all right so so let's do a

140
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,640
quick weather I haven't seen you guys in

141
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:59,610
a couple of weeks so we have caught up a

142
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,620
little bit but you can see you know it

143
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,780
feels really warm and it has been really

144
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,490
warm during the day but it's still

145
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,859
cooling off at night throughout much of

146
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,379
the Northeast even down where Shawn is

147
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,629
probably at the elevation level you're

148
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:15,180
getting some differences and so you can

149
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:17,459
see by the by the you know the heat

150
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,910
accumulation we're still a little bit

151
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:23,879
behind but the heat has really brought

152
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:26,610
on the growing degree days which then

153
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:29,370
gives us an indication about broadleaf

154
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,490
weed control we still use this model

155
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:35,040
from Purdue as a guide of when Esther

156
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,389
and Amin formulations we've talked about

157
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,090
this in the past since we're talking

158
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:41,370
weeds today but one of the things we are

159
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:44,189
noticing is that it's getting a bit dry

160
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,439
in many parts of the Northeast now maybe

161
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:48,750
not so much again down in Virginia tak

162
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,939
down in Blacksburg way but you can see

163
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,240
when you look at precipitation -

164
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,800
potential evapotranspiration you can see

165
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,960
throughout much of the Northeast

166
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,600
especially the northern parts of the

167
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,448
Northeast it's really starting to get a

168
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,060
little bit dry you can see that we're

169
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:09,060
expecting a further drying whether we're

170
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,879
getting regularly losing around an inch

171
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,129
of water a week now and so it's really

172
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,009
good obviously you're all noticing it

173
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:18,629
you're grown grass on sand in many cases

174
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,360
that we're striving for really good

175
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:23,790
drainage obviously now a water

176
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,790
management becomes a significant part

177
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:30,060
and boy did that switch click quickly

178
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:33,930
we went from cold 40 degree temperatures

179
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,180
to now well into the upper 80s here in

180
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,250
upstate New York now what's fascinating

181
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,829
about this again if you look at our

182
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:44,220
weather conditions right you can see

183
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:45,899
heat stress is defined essentially when

184
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,600
your nighttime temperature and your

185
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:51,209
nighttime relative humidity some to an

186
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,370
excess of a hundred and fifty right when

187
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:55,560
you're in excess of 150 between

188
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,860
temperature and relative humidity in the

189
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,930
evening hours a p.m. to 8:00 a.m. that

190
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,020
gives us heat strikes conditions and you

191
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,240
know one day two day three days of those

192
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:08,189
kinds of things you can see we're

193
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,860
finishing up coming out of some heat

194
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:12,959
stress that looks like it's going to

195
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,699
dissipate towards the end of the week

196
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,339
but we've got another day of it here

197
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,709
it's worth checking out on the forecast

198
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:21,388
website how about the soils obviously

199
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:24,180
the soils are warming dramatically look

200
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:26,970
at how they're warming west to east this

201
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,949
time and you see this pattern sometimes

202
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,260
based on where the winds and the

203
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:34,229
weather's come from we had a lot of east

204
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,450
wind the last week so you're going to

205
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,950
see a little bit lower soil temperature

206
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,129
soil temperatures makes us think about

207
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,200
soil pathogens oh boy or pathogen since

208
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:45,299
we talked about and Steve McDonald

209
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,509
posted a really nice blog on his green

210
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:51,958
cast blog this Steve McDonald is a must

211
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:53,879
follow kind of guy if he writes or does

212
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,778
things he's always worth paying

213
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,720
attention

214
00:08:54,778 --> 00:09:00,480
just the value of being observed in and

215
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,269
here is take all patch in higher cut

216
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,240
bentgrass that he doesn't see very often

217
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:08,549
but this is a picture taken recently

218
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,938
where you see alternative plants growing

219
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,748
inside there right Bank grass at a lawn

220
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:15,208
height cut

221
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:16,949
now what about diseases a couple that

222
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,539
you know the conversation is a little

223
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:19,828
bit more involved than it used to be in

224
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:21,688
the early season when nothing was

225
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:23,308
happening because now if you go to our

226
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:26,998
forecast website you'll see this

227
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:30,028
historical and predictive modeling of

228
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:33,028
various disease and pest pressure like

229
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:36,419
weeds and in sand diseases as well and

230
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:38,188
so here is the map over the last 30 30

231
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:40,409
days down in Farmingdale

232
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:42,149
I usually tracked the Bethpage State

233
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:44,068
Park where we do a lot of our research

234
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,350
and you can see over the last several

235
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:48,688
days anthracnose pressures been pretty

236
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,939
high what about the dollar spot pressure

237
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:53,338
high and looks like it's getting a

238
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:55,980
little bit higher building throughout

239
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,509
the Northeast obviously this is the kind

240
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,600
of thing you want to keep track of and

241
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:02,129
your Smith Kearns model as well a little

242
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,808
bit of note from Mike Hadley at the

243
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:05,399
black course about annual bluegrass we

244
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:08,250
will already starting to take out some

245
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,740
collars early indications right we're

246
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,600
adults were tough to get they were

247
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,629
spread out a long period of time they

248
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,449
don't use adult decides with with the

249
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:21,028
absence of durst band now in Bethpage so

250
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:22,889
they have to rely on larvacide so now

251
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:25,769
obviously this is beginning to give

252
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,509
indication set you know we've got to get

253
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:30,120
those larger sides out and here's

254
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:33,028
Steve's blog post about adult activity

255
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,278
and larval activity all right well the

256
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:38,308
conversation for today is is around this

257
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:40,620
particular problem that Piper and Oakley

258
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:42,659
talked to us many many moons about in

259
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,850
the original turf for golf courses book

260
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:46,588
the very first one published and it's

261
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,959
still something that has struck we

262
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:52,170
struggled with as an industry for those

263
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,119
that look on it as a weed today the

264
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:56,188
conversation is annual bluegrass as a

265
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,528
weed not annual bluegrass and in

266
00:10:56,188 --> 00:11:01,889
maintenance maintenance and if you don't

267
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:04,019
know sean has a wonderful presentation

268
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:06,120
he's given it's got to be from a seminar

269
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,419
something Shawn where you've done this

270
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,179
really comprehensive review

271
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:13,399
of just about everything you know if you

272
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:15,529
want to know what's going on in annual

273
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,449
bluegrass control just looking through

274
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:20,120
the slides in this presentation that I

275
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,410
pulled just prompt our conversation

276
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,169
today's show and what a wonderful job

277
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:26,659
you did here I love how you've done some

278
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:28,429
of the price comparisons with the

279
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:30,279
different products right and you know

280
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:34,279
people forget you know progress

281
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:35,769
exonerate velocity tenacity all with

282
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:39,169
post-emergent

283
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:41,299
activity you you know did a really nice

284
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:43,159
job of looking under you know this

285
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:46,729
particular study we looked at a variety

286
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:50,240
of different annual bluegrass control

287
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,190
programs over a two-year period see you

288
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,129
know I like when people send out data

289
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,770
that's multiple years of time and of

290
00:11:55,129 --> 00:12:01,460
course as we introduce the methods olan

291
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:05,899
a product developed by SJ kim cornell

292
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:06,830
alum now in in south korea many years

293
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:09,139
ago you know we're having this

294
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,580
conversation in 2020 show and i remember

295
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:13,490
when this thing was going to be labeled

296
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,310
in 2016 and this is your work from the

297
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:23,240
early teens 2010 I think you sprayed the

298
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:25,129
first one in 20 2009 yes that you just

299
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,000
showed there was young

300
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:32,269
Hans work at Penn State

301
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,710
Young is now like national leader for

302
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:38,899
pork you porker in the USA right I bet

303
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:41,750
he did that work at Penn State but yeah

304
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:45,829
it's uh it's been on it's been a long

305
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:47,659
ride since oh nine and a pretty cool one

306
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,900
except for the fact that like you said

307
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:53,919
we we've been for ten years

308
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:57,949
expecting imminent registration and

309
00:12:53,919 --> 00:13:03,049
finally finally it's here fine so let's

310
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:05,120
start with the questions um it seems to

311
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:06,949
me that we've had products that can kill

312
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,929
PO an your the problem is we like them

313
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:11,750
on greens that's where we want it and

314
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:14,419
when it dies you know the ball doesn't

315
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,009
roll so good and you've also so we're

316
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,990
not gonna get into that because if I let

317
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:20,360
Carl loose on your study with the ball

318
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,329
deflection we'll get nowhere on this

319
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,639
topic so so let's

320
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:26,438
just talk about let's start there there

321
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,039
are other post-emergent products what

322
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:32,139
makes Methos Oland different so the the

323
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:36,428
thing that that has limited our

324
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:38,499
application on greens for so long is the

325
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:39,399
inability to get true selectivity

326
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:42,278
between bentgrass

327
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:45,308
and poet so they are products that can

328
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:48,610
kill power but the the putting green

329
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:52,389
management the autonomy on the green is

330
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,919
such that we are so sensitive to

331
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:55,539
environmental stress

332
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,719
we're so sensitive to have root

333
00:13:55,539 --> 00:14:00,639
senescence rapidly and we're always in

334
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,439
this Evan flow trying to read what the

335
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,619
turf is telling us respond to it and

336
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:07,568
keep it happy and herbicides I don't

337
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:10,209
think there is a herbicide on the planet

338
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:12,188
that's gonna help with that you know you

339
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:14,469
get your salary by managing big grass

340
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:17,948
stress herbicide doesn't help with that

341
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:20,110
so poker is the best ever at giving us

342
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:22,238
that selectivity it's still her design

343
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,149
and we still have things we need to

344
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:28,179
tiptoe around but it's the best at at

345
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:30,639
selectivity between polar and bent like

346
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:33,458
the product is it's got just a lot of

347
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,678
really good things that we would want to

348
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,688
have it's got a very quick environmental

349
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:38,889
degradation which you would think oh we

350
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:40,719
don't want that laurent hang around and

351
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:42,818
kill the poet well the good news is you

352
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,829
can go through five to seven half-lives

353
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:46,838
of this product and still get polar

354
00:14:44,828 --> 00:14:48,488
pre-emerge if you're using it at their

355
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:49,689
point six fluid ounce rate that we

356
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:53,079
recommend in post-emergent

357
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:56,048
so it's still its rapid degradation but

358
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:58,418
but huge selectivity between poem bit

359
00:14:56,048 --> 00:15:01,058
and so we can it also gives us the

360
00:14:58,418 --> 00:15:02,409
ability but we don't know the motive

361
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:05,618
action we've done a lot of work on that

362
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:07,928
we're not yet there yet but the way it

363
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:11,589
works it gives us the ability to just

364
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:13,298
turn that nut a little bit fun and a

365
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,879
little bit further until we slowly

366
00:15:13,298 --> 00:15:18,519
transition out the pole which is we've

367
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:22,239
had other products of ALS inhibiting

368
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:24,578
products photosystem inhibitors that you

369
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:26,589
just can't do that either it's going to

370
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:29,618
work and if it does it works I mean

371
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:31,779
right now or if you dial it back a

372
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:33,278
little bit it just absolutely does not

373
00:15:31,778 --> 00:15:35,649
work you get complete recovery every

374
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,139
time and we've never been able to say

375
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:41,078
okay well I'm gonna put six apps out and

376
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:45,100
a in a strategy that's part spring part

377
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:46,299
fall and just slowly transition the poet

378
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,119
everybody says they want that slow

379
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:50,979
transition but then they start applying

380
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:53,649
the product and they're like oh man it's

381
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,139
no not dying well you just hang in there

382
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:57,938
that that so the downside is in order to

383
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:00,639
get that slow transition it takes one to

384
00:15:57,938 --> 00:16:02,919
two years and no one everyone goes in

385
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,659
saying I'm cool with that but they get

386
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:06,759
halfway in saying man I'm not cool with

387
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:08,469
this it's not happening fast enough but

388
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,659
but that's what we're trying to do and

389
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:14,889
that product can do it that's I remember

390
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:16,389
when I was first chatting with what is

391
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:20,289
the young man's name that was at Penn

392
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:22,028
State young young yeah yeah I met young

393
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:23,860
many times when he was first going

394
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:25,720
around when this was first happening and

395
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,209
one of the things he used to say to me

396
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,428
early on was they were using it in Korea

397
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:32,739
and he said Frank they just sprayed it

398
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:35,379
on these warm season grass fairways and

399
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,749
they didn't see they didn't do anything

400
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:40,389
all they did was just let what was there

401
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:43,420
sort of fill in and do its thing so let

402
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:45,370
me ask two questions one is you said it

403
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:48,578
takes a number of years let's start with

404
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:51,370
best practices I understand the jargon

405
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:54,039
is fall program spring program we don't

406
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,740
have to get into the minutiae of rates

407
00:16:54,039 --> 00:17:00,278
I'm sure it's important but let's start

408
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:02,709
with what are best practices and at the

409
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:05,648
same time do you need to see can this

410
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:07,838
happen and let's refine our comments

411
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:11,078
even further Sean let's talk about

412
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,698
putting greens because what your work

413
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:14,500
showed too is there's a lot of good

414
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,449
products for fairways tees in rough

415
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,099
there are a lot of good products nobody

416
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,890
pays attention to you made the case for

417
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:23,438
exonerate there's maybe a better product

418
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,299
yeah there is as well so if you're going

419
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,220
to talk about greens we don't then then

420
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:30,278
rate becomes easy there is only one rate

421
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,720
it's 0.6 fluid ounce per thousand though

422
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:33,538
that that's all rate we don't really

423
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,100
have to go so then the question becomes

424
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:38,679
how many applications I'm am I going to

425
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:40,569
apply at what frequency and win alright

426
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,269
and if you're applying those

427
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:46,599
applications in the spring what you're

428
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:49,329
gaining from that is a very slow like a

429
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:51,778
stunning of growth and a

430
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:54,759
very slow reduction of population that

431
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:56,200
with say three spring applications

432
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:58,148
you're probably not going to get much

433
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,919
more than ten twenty percent population

434
00:17:58,148 --> 00:18:03,189
reduction with spring programs it's not

435
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,380
that is not your I'm going to renovate

436
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,179
I'm going to kill it all program it's

437
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,510
not going to happen in the spring we're

438
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:14,200
trying to arrest expansion and set

439
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:16,390
ourselves up to get it's all about what

440
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,909
are we paying an injury risk too bent or

441
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,590
well what are we paying in risk to the

442
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:22,870
putting quality is really what it is

443
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:26,740
because the product is safe on bent

444
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:29,168
unless we really do something outside of

445
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,179
the herbicide that is stressful that the

446
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:33,460
herbicide then can then exacerbate then

447
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:35,440
we might get some vent injury but the

448
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,850
product alone at the rates were using

449
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:43,750
will not harm meant those the full

450
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:46,778
application set up the program for the

451
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,460
fall that's right so the spring programs

452
00:18:46,778 --> 00:18:51,369
are getting us and hopefully a little

453
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:54,880
bit better position to get a little more

454
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:57,609
bent than we had so that we can go after

455
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,789
the pole in the fall so two applications

456
00:18:57,609 --> 00:19:03,099
is usually all it takes three is is in

457
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:04,960
most cases going to be complete

458
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:06,819
renovation of polar if you're doing in

459
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,860
the fall so if you're if you have a

460
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:11,740
population that's not responding to pork

461
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:13,719
here very well then what you when I say

462
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,669
turn that nut a little bit tighter what

463
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,500
you can do is you can shift one or two

464
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:20,320
of those spring applications into the

465
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,169
fall and that's really going to ramp up

466
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:25,778
product performance or killing polar

467
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:28,840
which again everyone needs to remember I

468
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:31,960
know you won't get dead I'm going to

469
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:33,699
dead but what we're struggling against

470
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,220
with this herbicide and with our

471
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,798
playability is to take the pull out

472
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,058
slowly and so if you put now you could

473
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,690
save some money if you're willing to

474
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:47,079
take that decline in putting quality

475
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:49,990
peel and swallow it you could go out

476
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:53,439
with for fall applications take your

477
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,940
pole out and the following spring what

478
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,100
you're going to be left with is if

479
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:00,909
you're dealing with a 50 to 70% pole

480
00:19:57,099 --> 00:20:02,319
green what you'll be left with is the

481
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,160
vent grass is going to wake up the pole

482
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,019
is all going to look

483
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,150
you can manage that with colorants but

484
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:08,710
it's going to start to die and it's

485
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,930
going to start to melt out before the

486
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:15,190
bit can fill in you're going to end up

487
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:18,310
dealing with about four weeks of pitted

488
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:21,430
cutting surfaces something on par with

489
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:24,609
an aeration event and once you grow that

490
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:26,860
in you're essentially pure event and a

491
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:28,659
lot better so that may be a strategy

492
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:30,549
some people are looking for but most

493
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,000
people are going to go toward a couple

494
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:37,539
of spring apps and two to three fall

495
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,390
apps or more often maybe up to for

496
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:43,210
spring apps and up to two all apps it's

497
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:45,009
just so so with that yeah so there's

498
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,350
lots of ways but one of the things I

499
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:48,759
think is critical and and you know Carl

500
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:51,490
and I know this because we study a

501
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,440
little bit the decision making practices

502
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,589
of superintendents and and and the

503
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,860
deliberateness of on some cases and and

504
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:02,829
the reflexive in other cases right and

505
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:05,259
and so when is a good time to know if

506
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:07,089
what you're doing is working right let's

507
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:11,500
say I did the to fall treatments how do

508
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:13,539
I know when I gotta turn that nut and

509
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,259
I'm thinking at the same time you know

510
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:19,680
you you you know develop the late fall

511
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:22,299
application seed head control

512
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,779
something's happening to pol annua

513
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:28,599
even in a perennial form in that part of

514
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:30,430
the year so tell me number one what do

515
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:31,990
you think's going on with Poe at that

516
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,060
time of year that maybe he's helping

517
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,519
with Methos ole and control as well and

518
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:38,740
then how do when do I evaluate it can I

519
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:41,200
evaluate at the summer of next year to

520
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,970
know if what I'm doing is working so

521
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,130
first of all I do think the evaluation

522
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,019
is going to be in year two and so

523
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,390
depending on your scenario and what you

524
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:50,859
want I think so the way right now the

525
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,380
way the products being marketed and

526
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:56,859
superintendents go to polar calm and

527
00:21:53,380 --> 00:22:00,100
they enter a direct relationship with a

528
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:03,639
manufacturer so every so right now all

529
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:08,349
but five US states have had

530
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:11,190
registrations of which New York is five

531
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:15,909
California is not one Florida is not one

532
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:20,799
Washington and that's the New York

533
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:23,950
California Washington and I can't read

534
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,990
my writing on the other one anyway so if

535
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,240
it's in New Jersey and Connecticut it's

536
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,130
somehow gonna leak through the Hudson

537
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,279
River you know we don't want to talk

538
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:35,230
candidly about this and I think there's

539
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,170
gonna be a lot of scrutiny of it so

540
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:40,210
let's just say you work directly with

541
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:43,210
the manufacturer you don't have a

542
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,289
salesperson that you generally will deal

543
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,470
with the way you do with your other

544
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:49,420
products so they are going to get from

545
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,250
you what do you want and they're going

546
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,620
to give to you here's what we recommend

547
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,079
and also one of the things that that

548
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:58,299
they've implemented is if you did not do

549
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:01,720
the EP or have not tested the product on

550
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:04,809
your course before now then they are

551
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,750
requiring that you your maximum purchase

552
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,829
in year one is only four bottles which

553
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,619
is only enough to do some

554
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:14,319
experimentation on your course if you

555
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:18,339
say screw that I want to get started now

556
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:20,079
then you have to sign a waiver ah so but

557
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:21,849
they're they're strongly encouraging

558
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,710
people to get on-site experience with

559
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:25,480
the product before they proceed because

560
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,430
of the sensitivity of putting greens and

561
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,839
all they of course of course scenario

562
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,160
you so the question you asked was

563
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:31,659
alright what are we doing the scenarios

564
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,210
are going to be probably five or six

565
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,410
applications per year and they're going

566
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,960
to be catered predominately in the

567
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,029
spring and less in the fall after you're

568
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,430
done with exactly what that program

569
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:44,710
implementation is that is the time the

570
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,140
time to the question is this working is

571
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,460
not midstream as that's what that's the

572
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,230
mistakes that we've seen over and over

573
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,120
and all the experimentation people get

574
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,069
midstream and saying I it's not working

575
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:55,989
oh we all we didn't spray that product

576
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:58,629
because joe said it wasn't working and

577
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:01,870
so that that's where we've run into a

578
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:03,400
lot of problems or people say yeah put

579
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:05,349
it out and it's anything so I went ahead

580
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,210
one week later and put another dose out

581
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:10,149
you know though that's another and then

582
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:11,710
you get rapid activity anyway so one

583
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,600
year out the second year is when you

584
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:16,150
assess where where are we did we get

585
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:19,629
where we want to be do we need to change

586
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:23,019
things up okay it's just like it's about

587
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:24,670
seeding as well let's just let's these

588
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:26,710
two other things that are critical when

589
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,840
this thing was coming up and

590
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,850
looked like a registration was imminent

591
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,379
there was a note that went out to the

592
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:34,119
folks that were tested in and I was

593
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,278
privy to it then hey you can't do this

594
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:39,639
near drainlines now I don't need to get

595
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:42,159
into the politics of this but I would

596
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,070
hold it up in New York and worse yet if

597
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,980
it has water quality or water movement

598
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:49,599
stuff it's a no sale on Long Island and

599
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,380
I hate to say that to my Long Island

600
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:55,298
friends yeah a little bit about that I'm

601
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,179
with you Long Island friends if it had

602
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:59,798
issues I wouldn't recommend it and so it

603
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:03,640
wasn't really a political thing that

604
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:05,798
happened what happened was it was kind

605
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,399
of a speed of flow through issue with

606
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:11,889
EPA they originally the company had

607
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:15,069
submitted all the documentation for

608
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:18,370
aquatic toxicity they asked for and

609
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:20,439
received a waiver from the EPA that

610
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:22,869
allowed them to use agent route instead

611
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,690
of rainbow trout which is normally what

612
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:27,609
they require okay they already had data

613
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,380
on Asian trout which was exactly what

614
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,869
the EPA wanted but they didn't have it

615
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,028
on rainbow trout EPA said sure

616
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:36,788
give CAG trial they got the Asian trout

617
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:38,470
data and right before the eup the

618
00:25:36,788 --> 00:25:39,940
experimental use permit program that

619
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,159
you're talking about where the drain

620
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:46,419
tile issue came up right before that

621
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,460
happened one of the EPA scientists just

622
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,740
wasn't happy about it was a no effect

623
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:55,090
level but he wasn't happy about one of

624
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:57,159
those Asian trial levels so they

625
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:59,019
essentially midstream changed their mind

626
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,730
and said we don't want agent trout

627
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:03,609
anymore we want you to do the rainbow

628
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:06,130
trout that is in our documentation so

629
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:08,648
they kind of reneged on you know they

630
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,539
basically rejected the REC the Asian

631
00:26:08,648 --> 00:26:12,579
trout data they wanted to study redone

632
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:15,579
with rainbow trout so then two things

633
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:17,259
happen the first was the company had to

634
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:19,240
then do I don't know a million-dollar

635
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:21,908
rainbow trout study and that takes time

636
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:26,140
that was one of those delays the other

637
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:28,210
is EPA suddenly puts the product in a

638
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,940
category okay we don't have any aquatic

639
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:32,890
oxidative so since we don't have any

640
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,870
data if we add data but you know I'm

641
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:38,409
saying it didn't qualify now because the

642
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:40,268
guys said I don't want it so they placed

643
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:43,179
it in a category of

644
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:45,009
you know we gotta air on the safety and

645
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:47,080
so they put that restriction on the EP

646
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:48,848
now that the SC formulation is

647
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:50,829
registered in the United States here's

648
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:53,648
your proof that it's not a problem no

649
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:55,989
drain tile restriction in fact the only

650
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:58,598
stipulation regarding water is that you

651
00:26:55,989 --> 00:27:00,759
cannot spray the product directly into

652
00:26:58,598 --> 00:27:02,439
the water so an island green is good to

653
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:04,118
go you can spray right there is no

654
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,879
buffer zone you can spray right to

655
00:27:04,118 --> 00:27:08,588
within an inch of water as long as you

656
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:12,218
know that you're not spraying on the

657
00:27:08,588 --> 00:27:14,408
water so well I just I'll give you a yes

658
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:17,048
you know making it through California in

659
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:19,599
New York that's gonna be the acid test

660
00:27:17,048 --> 00:27:22,418
and especially Long Island which is much

661
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:24,700
like California one last thing see if

662
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:28,450
there's any questions you know six

663
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:31,749
applications you know I want to keep it

664
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:34,690
out I get a little nervous it might be

665
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:37,048
coming back in should I keep using that

666
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:39,399
thes ole in am I worried about

667
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:41,858
developing resistance that's of course

668
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:44,108
as a weed scientist comes to my mind but

669
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:48,519
also can I transition to a trim it

670
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:50,499
program can I transition to a tenacity

671
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,679
well not with Bank grasses but some

672
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:55,868
places what do you recommend number one

673
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,329
about resistance management about and -

674
00:27:55,868 --> 00:28:00,189
I'm assuming other products are going to

675
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:01,418
be part and parcel to that absolutely

676
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,959
and from a resistance management

677
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:07,929
standpoint on the one hand as you say we

678
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:11,169
are we're placing ourselves in in a

679
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:13,929
scenario that is ripe for developing

680
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:17,079
resistance because to ensure bit grass

681
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:19,719
playability we are trying to down the

682
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:23,288
rate back and meat or the product out at

683
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:26,139
these low sub-lethal rates until finally

684
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:28,179
we get the mortality we desert that we

685
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:29,738
want and that mortality is coming from a

686
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:31,899
combination not just of the herbicide

687
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:34,209
which the herbicide could do it but

688
00:28:31,898 --> 00:28:36,008
we're we're using herbicide Plus bit

689
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:37,659
competition to get that job an

690
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:39,069
environmental stress to get that job

691
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:41,709
done and so we're trying to do is slowly

692
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:43,598
as possible we're setting ourselves up

693
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:49,808
to the belt resistance right but on the

694
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:52,689
other hand we have a system that is much

695
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:53,769
much less capable of developing

696
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,110
resistance and the reason I

697
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:57,849
say that is we have a product that's

698
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,919
going to be priced such that it's going

699
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:03,879
to be targeted applications only primary

700
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:06,550
greens otherwise targeted to collars or

701
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,560
localized areas so we're not going to be

702
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:10,809
bringing resistant seed from elsewhere

703
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,490
on the Golf Course onto greens right the

704
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:14,349
resistance problem if it's going to

705
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,720
develop it's going to develop on the

706
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:19,269
grain and you better damn well be

707
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,700
managing it on the grid like if you see

708
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:23,650
once you go through a renovation program

709
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,049
which I would say should take you should

710
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:27,820
be two years out before you consider to

711
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:28,869
put the rubber stamp on that and say

712
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:31,509
we're done

713
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:33,309
at that point you should be managing any

714
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:35,609
escape hole with a pocketknife you

715
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:38,289
should be managing with with a dabber

716
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:40,329
you know we've done work with divers

717
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:42,629
using paccarb uses all which is a pretty

718
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:46,629
cool option to limit green stress

719
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:48,790
dabbers with ochre so that you can you

720
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:52,270
know save some money and isolate the

721
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:54,700
product only where you want it those are

722
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:56,230
really good options to manage resistance

723
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,779
so we're on these little isolated

724
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,940
islands where the product is applied and

725
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:02,379
we don't have to worry about nasty stuff

726
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,690
coming in from the outside and that's

727
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,380
the big difference it's going to keep

728
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:11,799
resistance from becoming an issue on

729
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,810
everything but you know what it it does

730
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:16,029
sound like it's on your mind though I

731
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:19,240
I'm with you a hundred percent you know

732
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:21,720
we get this really good tool we've had

733
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:25,240
really good tools this is human behavior

734
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:28,059
where if we don't steward it properly if

735
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,009
we don't manage our P's and Q's in the

736
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:32,649
way we're using it we're going to lose

737
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:35,079
it and no matter what companies tell us

738
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:37,360
we you know listen

739
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:39,429
money is only gonna stop a certain layer

740
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,199
of this industry there's some parts of

741
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:43,990
this industry that money is not going to

742
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,130
stop them are you more concerned if we

743
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:51,009
go to teas and fairways and approaches

744
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:53,440
well so we've got we've got another

745
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:55,690
thing that's helping us out besides site

746
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,250
specificity in the application we have

747
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,620
an alternate mode of action and it's

748
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:03,640
called turf grass competition yeah the

749
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:06,579
resistance development inter is not not

750
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,389
completely but mostly limited to dormant

751
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:09,458
turf situation

752
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:11,108
she's like poor Angela oh the entire

753
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:15,038
southern United States is resistant to

754
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:18,009
triazines and schedule SS DNA's because

755
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:19,509
they're targeting polar in a period when

756
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,889
they don't have that alternate mode of

757
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:22,868
action when they don't have that turf

758
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:25,298
competition that's right in the North

759
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:27,519
we're pretty much always going to have

760
00:31:25,298 --> 00:31:29,319
turf competition to help manage that in

761
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,690
Korea they've been using the product for

762
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:33,428
pretty much a decade now no cases of

763
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,639
resistance they've been using it now in

764
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:39,389
Japan for a year or a little over a year

765
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:43,838
so no cases of resistance so far in

766
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:46,238
practice yeah we're always worried and

767
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:49,388
it's you know it's it's funny too it's

768
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:51,429
it's funny because listen we associate

769
00:31:49,388 --> 00:31:53,108
resistance we go we'll do a little deep

770
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:54,700
dive here know if there's questions Carl

771
00:31:53,108 --> 00:31:58,628
but I got a weed scientist so I'm not

772
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:01,119
going to yeah in my head in my mind I'm

773
00:31:58,628 --> 00:32:03,878
thinking if we don't even know the mode

774
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:09,308
of action you can't seem to isolate cell

775
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:12,368
wall or the t-80 mode of action is it

776
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:15,190
possible it's multi-site in a way that

777
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:18,668
we're not familiar with even testing

778
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:20,288
it's very well I'll tell you everybody

779
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:22,299
talks about these herbicides like this

780
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:26,378
one's an ALS inhibitor and that one is a

781
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:29,108
photosystem inhibitor but so

782
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:30,728
each herbicide is going to have well

783
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:31,989
potentially can have don't let me

784
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:35,139
overstep my bounds I'm not a

785
00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:38,528
physiologist but these herbicides can

786
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:40,328
have a different mechanism of acting on

787
00:32:38,528 --> 00:32:42,729
one species than they do in another

788
00:32:40,328 --> 00:32:46,868
Quinn cleric is an excellent example now

789
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:50,139
that is not killing crabgrass via you

790
00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:51,009
know hormone induced aux-in mimic

791
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:53,888
mimicry

792
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:56,200
you know it's killing crabgrass by being

793
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:58,328
a cell wall biosynthesis inhibitor so

794
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,578
here we have a product that kills clover

795
00:32:58,328 --> 00:33:07,989
as an oxen mimic and crabgrass as a CB I

796
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:10,989
hope you're in our lab we we have pretty

797
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:14,169
much proven that there is a very low

798
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:16,028
level a very low level t-80 inhibition

799
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:18,209
going on or at least something that

800
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:20,920
causes bleaching symptoms and can be

801
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:23,350
very partially mitigated by

802
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:26,050
adding back hoe magenta see acid so we

803
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:27,939
agree with the the German lab in that

804
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:29,680
respect that the t-80 inhibition is

805
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:34,450
happening but what we were able to show

806
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:36,640
that unlike what they concluded ta T's

807
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,620
not killing polar it's definitely not

808
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,750
killing poem and it's definitely not

809
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:43,239
even a major player like I don't think

810
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:45,789
it is the the element that's responsible

811
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,410
for killing anything we repeated all of

812
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:49,299
the studies that have been done and we

813
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:52,390
found that the results that they showed

814
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:54,039
were kind of exaggerated we saw some of

815
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,480
the same stuff but nowhere near at the

816
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,049
magnitude and then when we looked at it

817
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,720
on poorer

818
00:33:56,049 --> 00:34:01,899
it was non-existent on polar whereas on

819
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,360
duck weed it was so but we know it does

820
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:07,120
act on ta t I've seen actual bleached

821
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:09,849
plants in the field like broadleaf

822
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:13,690
plants and things like that's rare but

823
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:16,569
the true mechanism of killing poor dr.

824
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:19,570
Koo SJ ku the CEO of the company he

825
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,340
believes that it's probably a mechanism

826
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,980
that's related to the grameen aside it's

827
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:26,650
kind of like the ACC ace inhibitors

828
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:29,679
either a lipid biosynthesis inhibition

829
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:32,918
or a fatty acid because you know I mean

830
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,960
it has this odd selectivity that is

831
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:36,579
another way to get at this now listen we

832
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,940
could talk about this forever Carl are

833
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:42,509
there questions yeah one from John and I

834
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:45,789
know Shaun was touching on earlier about

835
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:47,320
maybe some abiotic factors that could

836
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:50,019
come into play John's wonder if there's

837
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,940
any concerns high heat days if you're

838
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:54,219
applying it then in March I know it kind

839
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,019
of maybe you'll get a random 90 degree

840
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:59,169
days something like that anything to be

841
00:34:56,019 --> 00:35:02,079
concerned with there well so the thing

842
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:04,360
to be concerned about is stress and and

843
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:08,170
in particular stress that can lead to

844
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:11,200
root senescence in poem so what we have

845
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:13,930
seen is aeration for example if you put

846
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:17,439
pala cure out in conjunction with an era

847
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:20,319
fication and topdressing event we pretty

848
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,809
much every time see much more rapid Poe

849
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,380
in your control and on occasion we've

850
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:28,599
seen been injury some mild fight oh we

851
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:31,750
actually had one series of studies that

852
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:34,089
we repeated and saw consistently if you

853
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,588
do this if you have a stressful era

854
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:39,130
fication

855
00:35:35,588 --> 00:35:40,960
Plus at the farm there is something

856
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,608
going on with the ethylene escalation

857
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,579
that's happening from Epiphone and

858
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:48,269
ethylene acts as a hormone I believe and

859
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:51,400
it's shown to promote senescence

860
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:54,190
ripening etc and other I believe that

861
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,829
ethylene escalation from the f-fine is

862
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:59,800
causing that environmentally do induced

863
00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:01,750
root senescence to go nuts and we're

864
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,630
losing you know where normally we would

865
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,980
lose 30% of the roots we might be losing

866
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:08,140
80% of the roots well they have to come

867
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,608
back from the crown if pol cure is on

868
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:11,529
the ground and you're in the middle of a

869
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:13,869
repeated application Spring Park your

870
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,670
program and you lose eighty percent of

871
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:17,920
your roots if it weren't for the pol

872
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,750
cured one week later no big deal roots

873
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,700
would be back down but if you've got a

874
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,400
band of four cure right there and the

875
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:26,259
roots have to come back from the crown

876
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,670
50 60 70 percent of them at least while

877
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:31,180
the fourth your concentrations high and

878
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:32,470
if they're not coming back well it will

879
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:33,818
lose bit grass or you're going to be

880
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:35,889
able to go out and pull a plug and say

881
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:37,989
whoa on the pole cure treated side I got

882
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:39,368
like almost no roots and over here where

883
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:43,118
I didn't treat poor cure it's already

884
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:46,240
back down to ten inches and so it's you

885
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,430
have to you have to manage stress as

886
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:51,429
best as you can while you're in the

887
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:53,949
middle of a pork your program so you

888
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:55,659
know either get your Arif occation like

889
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:57,669
if you're Corey refine I get that healed

890
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:59,670
in before you start you always want to

891
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:01,869
be two weeks apart from any other

892
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,150
potentially stressful application like a

893
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:07,480
packer butas on or for criminal like an

894
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:09,000
era fication chin two weeks before or

895
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,920
after and you want your pork to your

896
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,318
program in the middle there so so listen

897
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,059
if one of the things we see a lot of

898
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:17,858
people doing and there certainly are

899
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:20,318
places where this could happen as a

900
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:22,929
result of the pandemic and maybe some

901
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:24,429
right sizing people may decide hey maybe

902
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:26,739
we're gonna have Bank grass greens now

903
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:31,000
if I start out with a really good Bank

904
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:35,469
grass green when do or do I ever

905
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,338
consider a poker program would I just do

906
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:40,959
dotting would I go to a PGR program and

907
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:43,449
I'm thinking about those people that

908
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,710
might have put Bank rats in recently or

909
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:47,858
the last five years

910
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:48,519
some PO is coming in what about for

911
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:50,259
approach

912
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:52,840
get where you've got a lot of good

913
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,400
competition that's a great question and

914
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,900
you know there's a lot of people are

915
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,700
gonna fit that mold because they're

916
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,869
gonna one thing poor cure can't do for

917
00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:01,000
you they can't update your bentgrass

918
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:02,380
variety right right and so people are

919
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,480
going to take that advantage of say okay

920
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:08,440
now I can keep it clean let's do it all

921
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,570
right so you can get on so the the poker

922
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,309
is being as far as I know they're

923
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:14,200
marketing it there's two strategies

924
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:15,759
there's the renovation strategy which is

925
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:17,679
getting rid of the old Pola that you

926
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,660
have and while keeping the vent you have

927
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,579
and growing it back in and then there is

928
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:24,159
a maintenance program the maintenance

929
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:26,679
program is two apps a year it's going to

930
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,210
cost for the year less than a PG our

931
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,799
program would ruin your life if you're

932
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,199
going out with trim it on a routine

933
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,400
program and that's cost can you say

934
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:35,710
thirty five hundred a year that's about

935
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,300
what your maintenance program for pork

936
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,039
here to keep polar from coming into

937
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,960
those new greens would would call

938
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,429
somewhere in there and I'm pretty sure

939
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,139
what they're going to promote is kind of

940
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:49,419
a strategy where you rotate between you

941
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:51,250
know PGR or you could if you want to do

942
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,990
both if you've got the budget you can

943
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:56,230
come in with that single spring app of

944
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:58,689
Poker 0.6 fluid ounce and then two weeks

945
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,490
later at least you get on whatever

946
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,110
you're if you're doing Cutlass if you're

947
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:04,149
doing trimming or one of those type of

948
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,829
programs you're going to get on that and

949
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,139
stay on that to make sure that anything

950
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:09,130
mid summer can't come back and then in

951
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:11,650
the fall you're going to hit it again

952
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:14,230
with coal cure so that program is meant

953
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,210
to keep a long-term residual of Mathias

954
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:18,820
oh and in the sole so that you pull off

955
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:21,010
seeding seedlings that are brought in by

956
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:24,039
cleats and and God knows what else

957
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:27,790
watershed over the green can't you know

958
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:29,710
get hope or so so that that program is

959
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:31,269
part of it but again always keep that

960
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,619
resistance in the back of your mind and

961
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:35,710
always try to come up with your own

962
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:37,179
strategy to rotate other strategies into

963
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,980
that program that's right it's good to

964
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:40,809
hear it's been in Korea for a decade and

965
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,300
they're not talking about resistance

966
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:44,590
problems Carl we're well past you know

967
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,180
if you don't say something I'm just

968
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,309
gonna keep talking so are there other

969
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:50,349
questions or we're gonna thank Sean and

970
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:52,659
get him on with his day no more

971
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,860
questions I think that was a really good

972
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:55,059
summary of this though and then

973
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,440
obviously we'll throw this up on a

974
00:39:55,059 --> 00:40:00,329
recording I know a lot of people are out

975
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,329
it's a tea time in New York

976
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,179
Haymitch country songs you got one for

977
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:10,239
polo cure you haven't heard any of my

978
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:12,969
