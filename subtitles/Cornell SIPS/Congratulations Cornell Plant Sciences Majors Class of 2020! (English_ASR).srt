congratulations to the class of 2020

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,879
unfortunately we did have not yet had

6
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:20,009
our 2020 commencement commencement is my

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,019
favorite activity of the year

8
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:26,278
to celebrate all of your accomplishments

9
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:28,109
but once commencement is set for 2020 we

10
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,089
look forward to welcoming both you and

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,500
your families back to campus well this

12
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,198
sure didn't end the way any of us

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,659
planned but we want you to know how

14
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:38,460
extremely proud we are here particularly

15
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:41,279
because you've persevered through these

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,520
last few months of our keyboard if you

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,480
stare in Ithaca you experienced snow in

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,579
May a few times these are left Ithaca

19
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,488
you probably did so with little time to

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,989
say goodbye to friends or professors and

21
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,948
all of you experienced the challenges

22
00:00:54,988 --> 00:01:00,689
and joys of remote teaching none of what

23
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:03,149
has happened is taken away from the hard

24
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:06,239
work you've done from organic chemistry

25
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,549
to statistics to the outstanding job

26
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,849
each of you did doing your presentations

27
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,530
and the Senior Seminar in between we

28
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:15,539
shared Mills went on field trips

29
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,200
together with some of us travel together

30
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,710
to distant lands we hope your Cornell

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,650
experience has been special and that you

32
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:27,989
graduate with the knowledge skills

33
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:30,810
networks and confidence to be successful

34
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:32,578
in whatever path you take you're one

35
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,978
step closer to becoming our professional

36
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:37,319

37
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:40,828
from you no matter how many years after

38
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:43,618
you graduate you have experienced one of

39
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:46,109
the most unusual semesters that anyone

40
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:49,409
could have imagined and you've done it

41
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:51,390
with grace and resilience I hope that

42
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,340

colleagues and also a thorough knowledge

61
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:36,819
of the understanding of science that

62
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,098
Sciences it isn't a bunch of facts

63
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:41,979
science is a process it's a way of

64
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:43,780
knowing about the world the Eureka

65
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:46,119
moments are fantastic but it's really

66
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,568
about looking at that plant and saying

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,480
whoa that's really interesting that's

68
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:54,968
what drives science and it takes it a

69
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,949
collaboration of people to get this kind

70
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:59,739
of work done no one person knows

71
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:01,839
everything about anything and that's

72
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:03,718
what makes it so interesting so travel

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,239
