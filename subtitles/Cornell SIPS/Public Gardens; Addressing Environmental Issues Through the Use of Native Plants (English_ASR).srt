1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
university

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,160
well thank you all for being here today

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,679
i'm excited to

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,800
talk about what i've been doing the past

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,039
two years

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,320
it's definitely flown by

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,359
um so

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,800
just as an introduction to this topic

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,880
dawn mentioned that i had spent some

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,480
time at the birmingham botanical gardens

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,038
and

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,320
working in their native plant

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,160
collection

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,719
i really developed some interests that

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,039
were instrumental in

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,800
developing this topic public gardens

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,839
addressing environmental issues through

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,839
the use of native plants

20
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,679
so native plants have existed for

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,679
millennia have evolved

22
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,238
with their environments and have become

23
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,439
increasingly popular in the cultivated

24
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,599
landscape

25
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,599
for the purposes of this research a

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,478
native plant is one that occurs

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,719
naturally in a particular region state

28
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:13,319
ecosystem and habit without

29
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,319
direct or indirect human action

30
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,239
and to provide a context for this study

31
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,359
i am studying native plants in public

32
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,079
gardens

33
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,400
which are living museums mission-based

34
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,118
institutions which maintain

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,118
plant collections and plant records by a

36
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,159
professional staff and are open to the

37
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,359
public

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,560
the study of native plants are important

39
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,239
to botanical gardens because they serve

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,640
missions including displaying

41
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,640
biodiversity beauty and history

42
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,679
so when i began this study i started

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,280
questioning why native plants were

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,079
increasing in use

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,320
and one of my observation was that

46
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,158
they were being used to address

47
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,919
environmental issues such as food for

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,600
wildlife

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,320
a reduction in the use of chemical

50
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,639
pesticides fertilizers and water when

51
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,959
planted in their natural habitats

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,318
preventing the spread spread of alien

53
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,680
invasive plants contributing to

54
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,199
phytoremediation efforts addressing

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,239
climate change

56
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,318
and increasing ecosystem biodiversity

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,560
they also are valued for their aesthetic

58
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,560
beauty and regional sense of place

59
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,439
my research objectives for this study

60
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,359
are to understand how public gardens are

61
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,159
using native plants throughout their

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,400
gardens and program offerings what the

63
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,479
motivations are for doing so

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,319
and if they're addressing environmental

65
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,878
issues

66
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,719
native plants are supported by research

67
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:52,318
but i wanted to know what motivates

68
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,318
public gardens for using them

69
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,919
so i chose four u.s botanical gardens

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,920
based on preliminary interviews their

71
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,238
prominence in the field

72
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,958
and their collections policies i

73
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,439
conducted two to three phone interviews

74
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,080
to maintain consistency with leadership

75
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,000
staff of each garden including the

76
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,560
executive director director of

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,280
horticulture and director of education

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,360
when applicable

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,598
these interviews were followed up by

80
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,480
site visits when i had previously if i

81
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,639
had previously not visited the garden

82
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:32,719
and i conducted follow-up interviews

83
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:35,598
based on the need in the writing process

84
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,439
so now i'm just going to go through each

85
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,039
site

86
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,199
first site was the lady bird johnson

87
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,679
wildflower center which is located in

88
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,839
austin texas and it was created through

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
the vision of lady bird johnson and

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,598
actress helen hayes

91
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,598
their mission serves to focus their

92
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:55,199
displays in education around native

93
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,199
plants of the state of texas

94
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,519
the second site is new england

95
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,120
wildflower society's living museum

96
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,039
garden in the woods

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,519
it was founded and designed by will

98
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,438
curtis and they display native plants of

99
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,759
the new england region

100
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,759
education at garden in the woods centers

101
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,598
around engaging visitors to gain an

102
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,598
interest in using native plants

103
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,399
the third site was the blowdell reserve

104
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,319
located on bainbridge island washington

105
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,198
it was created through the inspiration

106
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,759
of prince blodel and his wife with the

107
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,280
mission of providing a tranquil visitor

108
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,319
experience

109
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,879
this series of landscapes spans over 150

110
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,879
acres and is picturesque of the pacific

111
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,879
northwest

112
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,319
the final site was the birmingham

113
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,599
botanical gardens which is unique to

114
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,839
this study and

115
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,919
it offers a variety of collections for

116
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,159
visitors to experience

117
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,240
including two gardens of nature which

118
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,680
focus on the display and education of

119
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
native plants

120
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,560
the collections were made possible by

121
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,000
donations of money and volunteer hours

122
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,000
by key individuals

123
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,560
so now i'll tell you a little bit about

124
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:15,519
what i found in the form of key themes

125
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:20,280
differences challenges successes and

126
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,279
practical implications from the study

127
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,959
so the first theme was the use of native

128
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,038
plants throughout the gardens and

129
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,719
program areas

130
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,639
as pictured here

131
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,960
native plants permeate throughout the

132
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,918
education and displays at the wildflower

133
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,319
center and at garden in the woods

134
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,560
while their styles vary at both of these

135
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,639
gardens teaching people to understand

136
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,918
appreciate and use the regional native

137
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,840
flora is in a sustainable manner is

138
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,839
central to the organizational goals

139
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,360
the use of native plants at the bledel

140
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,120
reserve is focused on providing a

141
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,879
tranquil experience

142
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,600
currently they do not have a formal

143
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,600
education program

144
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,918
at the birmingham botanical gardens

145
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,160
native plants are displayed in two areas

146
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,680
focusing on the biodiversity the state

147
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,840
has to offer

148
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,000
the barber alabama woodlands displays

149
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,839
mainly native trees and serves as the

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,120
hub of native plant education for

151
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,719
children

152
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,639
the call wild flower garden was

153
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
developed from an old stone quarry from

154
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,280
the works progress progress

155
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:34,159
administration and is pictured here

156
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:37,279
and displays herbaceous native plants

157
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,919
placing a special focus on those of wild

158
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,679
provenance in alabama

159
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,120
while native plants are not central to

160
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,199
their mission at the birmingham

161
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,439
botanical gardens they do offer

162
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,520
educational programming for all ages

163
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,319
that encourages a deeper engagement with

164
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,318
native plants

165
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,399
a second

166
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,360
theme was the motivation behind the use

167
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,359
of native plants

168
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,038
key figures played a role in

169
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,038
establishing each garden or collection

170
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,079
within the garden in each case of this

171
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,399
study

172
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:13,279
beyond that the key figures lady bird

173
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,198
johnson will curtis and princess bluedel

174
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,719
respectively at the wildflower center

175
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
garden in the woods and the lodel

176
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,840
reserve

177
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,520
were all influential in establishing a

178
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,198
mission that was instrumental in

179
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,799
determining the plant collections

180
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,800
policies at these gardens

181
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,839
a third theme was the motivation for

182
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,399
using native plants for environmental

183
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,399
purposes

184
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,759
each garden in this study emphasized

185
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,720
using native plants for a conservation

186
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,960
purpose

187
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,360
thus promoting an awareness and in the

188
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,279
case of the wildflower center and garden

189
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,598
in the woods the use and further

190
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,758
conservation of native plants

191
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,598
garden in the woods

192
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,000
further has

193
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,000
a display of rare and endangered native

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,079
plants

195
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,639
gardens also display native plants in

196
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:06,000
order to enhance their natural world so

197
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,560
as to bridge visitors to it

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,319
a couple of examples are

199
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,439
public gardens providing a place for

200
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,000
visitors to see

201
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,478
the effects of climate change on plants

202
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,598
and to see solutions on how to address

203
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,359
this issue

204
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,839
in the same way they are using native

205
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,520
plants in their natural habitats to

206
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,638
illustrate the reduction of water and

207
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,639
chemical inputs

208
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,080
some collections at the wildflower

209
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,439
center and garden the woods specifically

210
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,959
were established to address

211
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,039
environmental issues through their

212
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,278
research efforts

213
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,080
research areas included native plant

214
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,320
propagation carbon sequestration with

215
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,320
native grasses of texas

216
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,200
green roof composition

217
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,560
alternative turf mixes water runoff and

218
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,879
others

219
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,119
in the future each garden in the study

220
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,399
is increasing efforts to reduce their

221
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,399
environmental impact

222
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,800
another trend that arose in this study

223
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,680
was the focus of reaching three specific

224
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,679
audience groups

225
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,199
professionals in the lands in landscape

226
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,799
architecture architecture design

227
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,040
and contracting

228
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,399
young families and singles in their 20s

229
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,120
and 30s

230
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,600
by creating various educational programs

231
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,278
workshops and garden events towards

232
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,120
these different groups they hope to

233
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,120
garner their interests and further their

234
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,120
missions

235
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,159
there were two key differences between

236
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,080
the gardens in this study

237
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,879
the first difference was the specific

238
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,399
environmental issues that were addressed

239
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,320
because each garden resides in a

240
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,278
different climate zone in the u.s each

241
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,760
garden focuses on a different issue

242
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,480
for example the blue dell reserve in

243
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,399
washington state enjoys regular rainfall

244
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,759
however they are continually focused on

245
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,000
maintaining clean water sources

246
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,679
the wildflower center in central texas

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,078
places a major focus on water

248
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,559
conservation as they constantly face

249
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:16,559
drought

250
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,360
another major difference was in the

251
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,200
educational programs

252
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,278
offered

253
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,519
the bledel reserve was the only garden

254
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,240
in the study lacking a formal education

255
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,679
program although they do offer informal

256
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,519
programs such as walks and tours

257
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,359
education is completely focused on

258
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,039
native plants at the wildflower center

259
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,519
and garden in the woods

260
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,559
and recently the birmingham botanical

261
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,200
gardens

262
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,359
joined in efforts as all three of these

263
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,560
gardens offer a native plant certificate

264
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,360
program

265
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:54,078
these certificates are awarded

266
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,639
to participants through their completion

267
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,000
of required and elective courses field

268
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,838
trips

269
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,839
and volunteer service

270
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,320
each garden also experience exceptional

271
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,399
success in various ways of using native

272
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,959
plants

273
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,278
the three pictured here are ways that

274
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:20,000
gardens are disseminating information on

275
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,759
native plants

276
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,600
the native plant database on the

277
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,919
wildflower center's website is

278
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,040
internationally accessed and in last

279
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,958
year alone received 5 million hits

280
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,879
the recently launched certificate in

281
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,879
native plant studies at the birmingham

282
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,958
botanical gardens has had an

283
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,399
overwhelming success

284
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,239
in that their

285
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,639
response rate

286
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,680
and that they have had to create more

287
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,639
classroom space to meet the demand and

288
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:51,039
they have enjoyed an unexpected

289
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,559
revenue generated

290
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,599
the recent launch of new england

291
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,518
wildflower society's go botany program

292
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,920
a computer bit is a computer-based

293
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,399
broker program that is used to

294
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,799
facilitate education and displays in a

295
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,600
variety of settings and according to

296
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,679
staff is in high demand

297
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
success of the bloodell reserve comes in

298
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,919
the form of grant funding for

299
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,839
restoration programs which have

300
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,519
continually increased over the past two

301
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,240
and a half years

302
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:24,039
staff members also know the anecdotal

303
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,039
feedback from visitors

304
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,879
the key each garden

305
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,800
also faces challenges that affect their

306
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,120
displays and educational efforts of

307
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,000
native plants

308
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,360
one of these is managing invasive plants

309
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,759
today 1.4 trillion dollars or 5 percent

310
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,759
of the global economy is spent managing

311
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,600
invasive species

312
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,439
while historically public gardens may

313
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,320
have played a role in bringing invasive

314
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,399
plants in through plant exploration they

315
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,720
are recognizing their damaging effects

316
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,078
and costs associated with them and are

317
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,160
working to prevent their future

318
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,399
developments

319
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,319
other challenges included caring for a

320
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,519
large space with limited staff and

321
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,360
budgets

322
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,278
and overcoming the general lack of

323
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,278
knowledge of the value and importance of

324
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,679
native plants

325
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,559
just to be clear katie texas blue

326
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:21,120
bonnets are not an invasive

327
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:24,559
yes yes

328
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,560
that's a pretty picture to look at

329
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,439
thank you for pointing that out

330
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,079
using native plants in public gardens as

331
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,560
presented in the study culminates into a

332
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,399
group of practical implications

333
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,879
these are intended to build the success

334
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,399
of other gardens use of native plants

335
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,480
and how they use them to address

336
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,278
environmental issues

337
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,839
these include establishing expected

338
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,000
outcomes in their use

339
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,160
using them in a way that continues the

340
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,320
design of the garden

341
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:00,799
using their connection with native with

342
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,800
animals to bring in younger audiences

343
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,159
using them throughout the collection

344
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,160
instead of in individual collections

345
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,639
considering the environmental effects of

346
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,799
the design process

347
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,959
and to look at other organizations for

348
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,319
guides as creating successful displays

349
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,319
and educational programs

350
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,360
i conducted this study just to discover

351
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,600
how public gardens are using native

352
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,000
plants and if a main motivation is to

353
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,759
address environmental issues

354
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,240
i found that these gardens are using

355
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,480
native plants in diverse ways to not

356
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,320
only address environmental issues but

357
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,480
also to demonstrate that their value

358
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,760
goes beyond their positive environmental

359
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,680
roles

360
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,919
these gardens are able to display their

361
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,319
beauty encouraging and understanding and

362
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:53,838
appreciation of native plants

363
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,839
and thus furthering their use

364
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:02,480
so i'd like to acknowledge my committee

365
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,480
and cornell plantations for funding and

366
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,440
support throughout the process and the

367
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,440
other fellows in the program

368
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,838
yes okay did any of the places you

369
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,679
visited express a challenge of sourcing

370
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,199
their native plants such as propagating

371
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,519
them or finding them from commercial

372
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,919
suppliers and how did they address that

373
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,919
challenge

374
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:38,239
no they didn't because

375
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,198
all gardens have their own nurseries

376
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,600
that

377
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,039
it it really didn't come up

378
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,560
but

379
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,559
i think they're all um

380
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:52,479
some of them are wild collecting

381
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,479
seeds and

382
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,839
no it didn't come up in the interviews

383
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,440
at all actually

384
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,959
so

385
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,800
i think they're trying to actually

386
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,879
provide sources for people in their

387
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,879
community that do have challenges with

388
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,879
that

389
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,198
it's done both the blue dell reserve and

390
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,000
the birmingham botanical gardens where

391
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:17,599
it's a mixture of native plant displays

392
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,159
and non-natives

393
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,800
are the horticultures

394
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,439
taking measures in the

395
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:28,240
non-native displays to make sure that

396
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,680
they're not introducing invasives that

397
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,120
could migrate

398
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,120
into the native displays

399
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,039
i think that where that comes up is more

400
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,879
at the birmingham botanical gardens

401
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,120
the barber alabama woodlands that i

402
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,519
mentioned is

403
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,639
probably 20 feet from their japanese

404
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,879
garden

405
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,360
and the japanese garden does have

406
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,600
invasive plants so they are constantly

407
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,278
trying to pull those out

408
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,800
and that is something that they just

409
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,198
recognize as a challenge and it's

410
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,559
something that they have to do

411
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,558
um

412
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,879
at the blue dell reserve because

413
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,199
everything grows so fast

414
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,240
invasives are always a major challenge

415
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,640
and

416
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,599
the restoration programs

417
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,199
that

418
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,719
they are implementing

419
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:22,558
are really helping to address that

420
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,558
does that answer your question okay

421
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,960
yeah is there any external push

422
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,599
for

423
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,880
more more use of native plants at public

424
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,719
gardens generally speaking i know um

425
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,400
like chicago botanic garden is involved

426
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,240
in the

427
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,640
end of a plant like the seeds for

428
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,000
success program and things like that

429
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,240
so did you

430
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,440
get any response from the folks who

431
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,880
interviewed about external pressure

432
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,440
um

433
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,600
i think they are they're not sensing the

434
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,558
pressure but they are wanting to reach

435
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:01,119
out um the groups so these certificate

436
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,200
programs that three of the gardens have

437
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,279
they are really trying to reach

438
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,759
people in the industries like landscape

439
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,279
architecture

440
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,919
the

441
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,839
to encourage green building practices

442
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,600
and establishing plants in the correct

443
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,480
habitats

444
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,639
so i i think it's the pressure is more

445
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,960
than reaching out to people and not

446
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,320
they're not getting that from people

447
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,279
outside

448
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,279
um does that make sense

449
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,079
yes

450
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,599
so

451
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,160
i think a lot of the gardens in the

452
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,240
study have seen the growth but they

453
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,320
haven't specifically been tracking it

454
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,558
and that is something that i recommend

455
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,639
for future research to

456
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,639
really see what the impacts are in

457
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,640
numbers

458
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:08,200
this has been a production of cornell

459
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,200
university on the web at cornell.edu

460
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,038
you
