1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,399
university

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,039
thank you excellence well uh good

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,079
afternoon everyone and it sounds like i

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,558
am between uh

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,120
between this this group and a break and

7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:16,399
uh

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,640
would certainly like to thank the

9
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,118
opportunity for uh for cornell to having

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,519
uh

11
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,800
having bayer as well as myself join your

12
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,320
your presentation

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,320
uh today my name is mark foster and uh

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,800
i'm with bare crop science and our sea

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,839
growth

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,200
business i've been with with bayer for

17
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:38,238
roughly 22 years in both the canadian

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,480
and u.s businesses as well as across

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,320
both the row crop business and our our

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,000
veg organization

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,079
and it is introduced uh i'm going to

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,719
talk a little about how how bayer crop

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,640
science

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,239
positions themselves when we're thinking

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,719
about seed treatments

26
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,359
and the various components that go into

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,120
our

28
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,198
our thought process about bringing

29
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,320
products to market

30
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,878
so first and foremost who is bayer well

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,879
of course we're a multinational company

32
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,000
with a focus on seed trait

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,760
chemistry and biologicals and uh

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,560
and really when you start to think about

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,320
uh the sea growth perspective of course

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,400
we really encompass all of these things

37
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,959
that we're talking about on this screen

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,799
uh we we have wholly owned seed brands

39
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,599
we uh mark i'm not seeing you share your

40
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,439
screen

41
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,640
okay hopefully you're seeing it now

42
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,000
perfect got it

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,478
there sorry about that so

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,319
so as bayer we we do focus through the

45
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,478
uh the components of our our go to

46
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,359
market strategy inclusive of seed

47
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,799
traits chemistry and biologicals and uh

48
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,200
target them for both an

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,759
upstream use pattern as well as a

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,240
downstream use pattern

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,519
when we're focusing on on any type of

52
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,839
innovation

53
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,519
really the vision is driven by ensuring

54
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,960
that that the products that we're

55
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,078
searching for

56
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,078
offer offer value to our customers

57
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,759
that they can be utilized in sustainable

58
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,399
means and then also have an

59
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,680
ability for utilization as we look at

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,639
more data-driven decisions

61
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,479
so when we're thinking about seed growth

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,839
there's a lot of things that go into

63
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,800
into this type of type of innovation and

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,439
investment clearly number one in order

65
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,599
for a customer to uh to want to do

66
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,400
business with with any type of company

67
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,199
is to provide innovation and uniqueness

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,400
within

69
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:31,119
within their their operation

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,760
the next part is of course utilizing

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,920
some

72
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,239
some technologies and formulations that

73
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,799
can be broadly adapted for many

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,400
different types of use patterns

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,400
as you all know there's there's many

76
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,680
different types of treating systems out

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,120
there with varying degrees of

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,280
sophistication

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,959
and the ability to apply them correctly

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,878
is going to require some

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,920
some adaptable formulations that can

82
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:57,280
make them work in varying circumstances

83
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:59,359
that leads us to application technology

84
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,318
we have a wholly owned division within

85
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,000
bayer that that

86
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,679
builds treater application technology

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,280
and seed treaters based in shakopee

88
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,519
minnesota i'll talk about here

89
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,039
throughout the presentation and then

90
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,158
lastly from a customer service

91
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,239
perspective

92
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,759
it's definitely critical that that

93
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,439
you're able to service the products that

94
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,759
you bring to market

95
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,759
and uh and making sure that the customer

96
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,239
experience is a positive one

97
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,280
and from our standpoint the customer is

98
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,039
not only the

99
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,360
the person selling the seed treatment

100
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,798
that we sell the same treatment to

101
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,720
whether that be a seed company or

102
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,159
distributor but also through

103
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,318
the person who's actually doing the

104
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,318
application and then ultimately to the

105
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,598
farmer who is seeing success with

106
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,119
utilizing the uh

107
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,679
the product from an efficacious

108
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,680
perspective

109
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,280
now lastly when when we're thinking

110
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,239
about the marketplace

111
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,919
as mentioned we we are a uh a provider

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
of seed within the the global

113
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,679
marketplace and one of our largest

114
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,878
customers at bearcrop science is our

115
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,200
wholly owned brands

116
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,199
uh this gives us a great opportunity to

117
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,479
test run the formulations that we need

118
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,719
to make sure that they

119
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,079
they can be applied correctly and in

120
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,759
addition to it gives us

121
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,159
an opportunity to make sure that

122
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,798
customers are are able to see a pathway

123
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,079
to uh

124
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,200
to utilize the product not only there

125
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,639
will be a seed company we are a

126
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,120
chemistry provider

127
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,160
uh the seed growth space is a very small

128
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,959
world where uh

129
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,479
there's there's a today to finite number

130
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,758
of active ingredients

131
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,199
and we also want to make sure that

132
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,840
there's an opportunity to work with

133
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,120
other other providers out there

134
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,839
as mentioned we're an equipment

135
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,918
manufacturer and ultimately the success

136
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,758
of our products rely on application

137
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,000
being successful as well

138
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,080
and the investment that we have in uh in

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,959
creating application technology that's

140
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,079
sustainable

141
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:49,120
and and efficient is important and then

142
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:53,519
lastly making sure that we have end use

143
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,439
confidence now

144
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,799
just to maybe focus on what is an

145
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,240
example of success

146
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,000
and why these things get a little bit

147
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
more complicated

148
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,038
in this top right hand corner you see

149
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,319
some of the things that we're really

150
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,240
trying to do

151
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,918
as an example of a soybean seed

152
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,918
treatment we're really looking at

153
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,038
roughly eight to nine different

154
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,000
components

155
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,319
in very small scale that we're applying

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,918
to a seed in order to have the

157
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,918
the expression of of efficacy to control

158
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,240
varying degrees of pests or promote

159
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,879
growth in the case of biologicals

160
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,319
to be illustrated within a farmer's

161
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,639
situation

162
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,519
when we start to talk about these these

163
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,038
seven eight or

164
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,959
even up to nine different types of

165
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,439
products that we're putting on the seed

166
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,519
being able to do so on a on a finite

167
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,639
amount of real estate within the seed is

168
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,639
extremely important

169
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,919
with the development example through

170
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,159
equipment you can see a

171
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,240
a picture of a bayer on-demand treater

172
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,240
which allows for varying components to

173
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,319
be applied to specific

174
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,478
seeds at a at a very a controlled rate

175
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,039
and a very quantifiable rate

176
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,800
as you can see a closed system a closed

177
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,199
system that doesn't allow for

178
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,759
significant exposure to the user and is

179
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,439
ultimately a clean means of of doing so

180
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,600
while relying on loss-of-weight

181
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,279
measurements to ensure accuracy that the

182
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,319
amount of seed treatment that is being

183
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,879
applied to those

184
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,759
particular components is being done in

185
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,038
an accurate measure

186
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,000
so while we have many of those

187
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,478
components and we have ways to to apply

188
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,478
them

189
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,240
in an accurate means we we also have to

190
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,918
make sure that when we do put it into

191
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,478
the drum of the treater that the

192
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,359
the treatment itself goes on to the seed

193
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,519
and not

194
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,520
become sticky within the bowl or within

195
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,120
the uh within the drum

196
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,879
so success at the end of the day is

197
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,959
really having uh

198
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,879
that's that product you're applying go

199
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,038
from the chemistry jugs

200
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,319
onto the seed and not being upheld by

201
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,639
the by the

202
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,639
metal surrounding the application means

203
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,478
the next step of course is then taking

204
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,519
it from that treater and putting it

205
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,758
through the planter

206
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,560
and in a means of testing you want to

207
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,879
make sure that

208
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,240
uh all of those varying components still

209
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,918
allow flow ability

210
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,000
uh they don't bridge up within a

211
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,318
planting system which ultimately creates

212
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,199
time and and costly efforts on behalf of

213
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,280
a farmer

214
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,439
in order to get that planted seed into

215
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,758
the field

216
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,199
and then lastly of course the the proof

217
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,759
is always in the results

218
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,280
and when when we do get the seed into

219
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,598
the field we want to make sure that the

220
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,879
products do control the pests that they

221
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,478
perform

222
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,120
and and say that they will control and

223
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,800
ultimately lead to a farmer being

224
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,800
set up for a successful harvest

225
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,120
now from a a a four pillar type of

226
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,120
approach it really all starts with the

227
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,360
formulations that you're working with

228
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,598
and as we're considering these things we

229
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,000
have full formulations inclusive of

230
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,839
fungicides

231
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,720
insecticides adding seed coatings and

232
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,719
finishers

233
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,879
so things like fluency agent advanced to

234
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,479
ensure that we have flow ability

235
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,960
as mentioned in the previous speaker

236
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,519
biologicals are also added to the uh

237
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,680
to the uh the formulation and into the

238
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,439
into the actual application

239
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,360
and then ultimately making sure that the

240
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,800
formulation is stable

241
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,960
we need to make sure that we can ship

242
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,400
these products to the applicator and

243
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,120
they'll be able to maintain

244
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,519
uh their longevity and be able to manage

245
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,000
some

246
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,918
some more adverse conditions such as

247
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,720
higher heat temperatures or lower

248
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,279
lower temperatures to avoid freezing and

249
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,960
thawing

250
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,719
but ultimately maintaining their

251
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,679
viability to make sure they can

252
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,759
be used effectively and lastly another

253
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,918
pathway to that is through custom blends

254
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,399
which is ultimately the layering of

255
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,120
individual assets in fully formulated

256
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,958
means

257
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,360
one on top of the other and then can be

258
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,879
mixed together for a for an application

259
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,159
at point of of time

260
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,559
when we're thinking about that

261
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,559
application means we we do run all of

262
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,599
these things through our labs

263
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,679
and then at a pilot scale in our in our

264
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,240
research facility and then we move it on

265
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,439
to a

266
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,320
a full-fledged scale treater at uh

267
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,560
at a pilot plant our labs are located in

268
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,120
st

269
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,559
louis do this on a small scale to ensure

270
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,399
proof of concept

271
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,239
and then in our pilot facilities we have

272
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,639
scaled down versions of

273
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,480
full-sized treaters to make sure that

274
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,240
they do work in either a batch treatment

275
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,039
or a continuous flow type of

276
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,839
type of experience then the final step

277
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,759
is to uh

278
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,279
to take it to commercial treaters and as

279
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,360
mentioned we know that

280
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,720
while we build seed treaters ourselves

281
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,839
at bayer

282
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,519
we want to make sure that they have

283
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,480
functionality with a vast array of

284
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,080
application technologies that do exist

285
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,839
and when we're doing all these things

286
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,959
we're first and foremost considering

287
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,640
seed safety

288
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,159
putting this putting these chemistries

289
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,958
on the seed it's important they don't

290
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,639
hurt the

291
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,399
the efficacy of the seed from a

292
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,240
germination perspective

293
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,679
as mentioned by your previous speaker we

294
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,240
want to make sure that they uh

295
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,120
the chemistries can can work together

296
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,959
and don't uh

297
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,039
necessarily have antagonism when they're

298
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,919
when they're mixed together in a slurry

299
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,519
uh formulating recipe creations in in

300
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,559
utilization of those coatings and

301
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,159
finishers

302
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,479
and then ensuring that we have field

303
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,159
testing that that has been

304
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,320
accomplished to ensure that they they

305
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,958
work correctly

306
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,040
from an equipment perspective this this

307
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,119
varies anywhere from what i've called

308
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,120
inside the bag as well as some outside

309
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,120
the bag type of opportunities commercial

310
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,120
of course is when

311
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,600
upstream companies or c companies are

312
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,240
applying the product for you

313
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,519
generally this is a means professional

314
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,278
application

315
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,360
and then the formulations also need to

316
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,200
be able to work in an outside the bag or

317
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,320
downstream mentalities which is very

318
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,680
common in in soybeans and cereals

319
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,600
ultimately this equipment we want to

320
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,319
make sure is accurate

321
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,159
can be applied in a in a safe means from

322
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,360
a stewardship perspective and then from

323
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,919
a sustainability

324
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,039
uh component that they're applied in a

325
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,799
means that

326
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,919
that put the seed treatment on the seed

327
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:00,479
and that treatment stays there

328
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,159
and then lastly a full service portfolio

329
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,839
is important whether that be from the

330
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,559
development of the product in our field

331
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,880
solutions

332
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,958
organizations or uh technology

333
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,360
development all the way through to uh

334
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,319
to ensuring that the customer has a very

335
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,240
satisfied

336
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,240
product uh in the field

337
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,159
now just a couple more slides here that

338
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,278
i wanted to go through as to a bit of

339
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,078
the complexity

340
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,838
on the formulation development one of

341
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,519
the things that we take for granted is

342
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,800
ultimately we're trying to put

343
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,360
as many solds as we possibly can into a

344
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,958
liquid

345
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,399
and make sure they will still pump and

346
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:38,319
then hold themselves

347
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,559
to to the the seed once it's applied

348
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,000
as you can see within a formulation the

349
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,359
active ingredient portion

350
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,360
is is really about a quarter of it

351
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,720
and and beyond that you have several

352
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,639
other components that make the

353
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,480
formulation of viable

354
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,320
products be utilized whether that be

355
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,120
pigments or buffers

356
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,959
anti-foaming agents or de-dusting agents

357
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,320
and really getting the mix of those

358
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,399
products correct

359
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,519
uh is really what's going to ultimately

360
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,240
have the best

361
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,839
uh best utilization for your end user

362
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,278
the active and green of course you're

363
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,360
working on making sure that it is going

364
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,799
to control the pests or or promote the

365
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,159
growth that you're you're actively

366
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,159
intending to do

367
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,439
uh from a disbursement we're making sure

368
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,838
that it will stay in

369
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,320
in the uh in the means of of liquid that

370
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,920
you want it to be staying in

371
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,519
and then ultimately from water and

372
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,479
solvent and filler that's to make sure

373
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,879
that it will uh

374
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,240
will flow within the certain formulation

375
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,399
that you've built

376
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,759
as well as then adding adjuvants and

377
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,559
rheological aids to

378
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,639
to make sure that they they do perform

379
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,679
in means of suspension and

380
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,278
application that you're searching to do

381
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,638
ultimately as mentioned you can see the

382
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,078
varying different types of things that

383
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,799
you're attempting to do

384
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,159
and uh whether that be adding solos to

385
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,719
liquids or oils it's

386
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,719
it's extremely difficult to do in a

387
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,959
concentrated means that is still able to

388
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,160
be utilized by our end customer through

389
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,159
the application means

390
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,720
now after we've got that formulation

391
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,759
built i'd mention the next element is to

392
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,800
make sure that we can

393
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,399
apply these products in a a way that is

394
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,639
going to ensure that there is

395
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,440
good stewardship as well as proper

396
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,440
efficacy

397
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,600
of the product ending up in the intended

398
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,360
active ingredient load

399
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,120
different types of means are done but

400
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,759
it's a couple of core measurements for

401
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,000
us are ensuring that dust and dust off

402
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,720
is well under control

403
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,679
with the formulations and if any tweaks

404
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,040
would need to be done

405
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,879
through d dusters or additions for that

406
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,719
and what you can see here from an

407
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,838
application standpoint in the bottom

408
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,399
left-hand corner

409
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,639
is particularly when you get to on-farm

410
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,240
applications not all seed quality

411
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,240
is uh is necessarily uh

412
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,079
industrial grade if you will so you have

413
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,240
to make sure your formulation is able to

414
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,958
be optimized to work with

415
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,839
with varying degrees of of seed quality

416
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,078
going in

417
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,440
and as you can see the in the bottom

418
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,000
corner we've we've

419
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,240
attempted to work with both uh highly

420
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,720
highly cleaned conditioned seed and then

421
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,759
and then some stuff that is maybe a

422
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,959
little bit more uh

423
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,958
uh or i should say less refined

424
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,239
after you've put the product on the seed

425
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,879
we we run it through some

426
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,480
seed flow ability testing ultimately

427
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,679
this is to ensure that it doesn't bridge

428
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,920
when it's within

429
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,799
within its planting technology or going

430
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,078
through the

431
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:30,000
the augers into the planter this is

432
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,679
definitely a pain point for consumers

433
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,519
if they do experience any of that type

434
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,278
of issue and in particular in the

435
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,879
planting situation

436
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,198
and uh what we know is that the

437
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,399
viscosity can change of that seed after

438
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,240
we applied these

439
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,559
these products to them so seed flow

440
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,000
ability is extremely important

441
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,239
and then the other thing i just talked

442
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,639
about is the the coverage so

443
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,278
uh ensuring that the uh there's enough

444
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,919
liquid

445
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,519
and uh application technology to ensure

446
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,838
that we have ideal coverage to the

447
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,919
entire seed

448
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,079
as some of these products are are

449
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,278
more of a contact rather than a systemic

450
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,239
and it's important to make sure that you

451
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,360
have good coverage

452
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,560
of of every every opportunity of that

453
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,079
that particular seed now lastly i just

454
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:16,159
want to talk a bit about our

455
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:18,078
our equipment focus here um

456
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,078
we've certainly seen tremendous

457
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:23,198
innovation when it comes to equipment

458
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:25,120
bayer has uh of course mentioned we have

459
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,799
upstream type of application equipment

460
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,879
through commercial plants

461
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,879
but there's also a need for uh for

462
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,958
downstream type of equipment

463
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,320
and clearly in the top left hand corner

464
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,278
you see examples of

465
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,360
of probably a little bit more

466
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,039
unorganized type of treatment location

467
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,639
and and we could probably all agree that

468
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,319
there's uh

469
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,720
some things we'd rather not see in that

470
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,440
picture below that is the the bayer on

471
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,759
demand

472
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,040
which controls the amount of chemistry

473
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,639
being being uh

474
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,240
applied to the sea but it's also a

475
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,560
closed system

476
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,600
opportunity where it's just really done

477
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,399
through the pumping

478
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,278
stands and and loss and flow measurement

479
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,159
of the chemistry

480
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:06,399
being applied through the atomizer this

481
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,559
uh this type of technology is all done

482
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,919
in the shakopee location where there's a

483
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,239
135

484
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,479
000 square foot facility built to

485
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,759
construct both upstream and downstream

486
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,560
equipment

487
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,120
of varying levels of of control and

488
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,919
scale

489
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,039
so we're very fortunate to have have

490
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:27,599
this investment to be able to utilize

491
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,360
the the top to bottom integration of

492
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,800
creating a formulation

493
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,120
but also being able to apply it the core

494
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,919
elements of of the equipment business is

495
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,480
really from application

496
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,240
uniformity as well as utilizing the

497
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,278
formulation to make sure it goes through

498
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,360
the equipment

499
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,439
but our true areas of emphasis are on

500
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,959
stewardship user safety

501
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,800
and then value assurance that the

502
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,039
product is going on to the product

503
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,359
onto the seed correctly and then lastly

504
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,799
from a regulatory compliance

505
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,480
it is very important that we use these

506
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,039
products at the appropriate rates

507
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,839
and uh and be mindful if they do get to

508
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:06,798
the seed

509
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:10,318
correctly so really in summation from a

510
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:13,279
a customer success standpoint

511
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,318
our goal here at bayer is to have

512
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,119
products that move

513
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,798
from a plantability perspective have

514
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,239
user safety

515
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,838
have considered stewardship

516
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,919
considerations

517
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,159
and then offer value to customers

518
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,280
through efficacious approaches to

519
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,679
to insects and and diseases

520
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,798
as well as offer means of applying

521
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,759
varying

522
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,038
biological components so with that i'm

523
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:41,119
going to maybe hit pause

524
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,119
and and see if there's any questions

525
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,160
this has been a production of cornell

526
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:54,640
