1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,770
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,769
University

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,350
Oh

4
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:14,830
so thank you for coming today today I'm

5
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:16,960
going to do a talk that is a little bit

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,359
different than the technical talk I gave

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,039
in plant breeding a couple weeks ago if

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,839
you're watching on YouTube it's maybe in

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,600
one of the channel of videos around this

10
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:28,089
portion of your screen but here today so

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,040
I just want to talk about some things we

12
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:31,960
doing more than the art side of breeding

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,140
and some of the trends and things we are

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,700
looking to influence to try to

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,210
maybe give us some more opportunities in

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:43,690
what different crops we can breed

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:46,268
and so in plant breeding much of what we

18
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:49,030
do aligns with some grand challenge

19
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:51,429
questions feeding a global population

20
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,739
look at sustainability and various

21
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:56,170
facets climate change addressing

22
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:58,718
malnutrition throughout the world and

23
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,689
being able to keep up with evolving and

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,170
dispersing pests and pathogens that are

25
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:07,629
coming to challenge their crops and

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:12,009
there's a lot we do to directly address

27
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:13,929
these but in the process the the topic I

28
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:15,430
want to integrate today and we'll

29
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,930
explore in a couple different stories

30
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,409
some you're familiar with some might be

31
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:23,289
new is reducing waste in the breeding

32
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:25,030
process itself and not necessarily

33
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:27,399
looking at directly in the waste stuff

34
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,280
there's a lot of the squash that is left

35
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:31,868
over from our breeding program that ends

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,599
up going to the food pantry a lot from

37
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:35,968
trials we've been distributing the

38
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:38,408
leftovers from our genomic selection

39
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:40,030
populations around before Thanksgiving

40
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:42,969
so there's some direct ways but there's

41
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,259
also just some wasted opportunity in the

42
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:45,669
breeding process so that's one of the

43
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:47,968
main things I want to talk today and

44
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,740
really bring it back to the market class

45
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:53,798
concepts and demands of the marketplace

46
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:55,688
and to see if we can influence them we

47
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,670
can maybe influence how much progress we

48
00:01:55,688 --> 00:02:01,478
can make

49
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:04,509
and so the one of the main challenges we

50
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:07,209
work on and so this pest this is a

51
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:10,899
striped cucumber beetle is a specialist

52
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:13,750
herbivore feeding on Kubik crops you've

53
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:15,699
probably heard from myself or my student

54
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,520
Lauren about how these beetle just are

55
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:20,859
specialized to feed on cucurbit crops

56
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,930
they will lay their eggs at the base

57
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,490
they sequester some of the bitter

58
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,740
compounds in the plants used for their

59
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,560
own defense and if you have a winter

60
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,330
like we did last year or it looked like

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,460
we might have this year remains to be

62
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,590
seen we really didn't have that killing

63
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,090
from the really low temperatures to

64
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,759
really really reduce the butyl

65
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,830
populations and so there were swarms

66
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,449
everywhere and it was one of the most

67
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,930
challenging year for a lot of Kubik

68
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:48,099
growers that i've heard of and we're

69
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,469
just really thinking about climate

70
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:52,359
change and how those mild winters are

71
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:54,430
gonna intensify this problem so from the

72
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,950
reading perspective you know what can we

73
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,930
do and it's important to think about it

74
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:03,069
from a breeding plant breeding

75
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,659
perspective because as we look at some

76
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:07,150
of the chemical controls we have and

77
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:09,280
we've relied on breeding for resistance

78
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,590
to these insect pests and probably many

79
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,349
insect pests has lost a lot of attention

80
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:17,349
because of the cheapness and efficacy of

81
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:20,349
a lot of the pesticides we've had that

82
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:23,259
really do a really good job of

83
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:25,269
eliminating this pests the challenge and

84
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:28,229
the increasing scrutiny these pesticides

85
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:31,630
have is as you can see these insects are

86
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:34,030
attracted to the flowers there's a lot

87
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:36,490
of nectar in the flowers pollen protein

88
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,959
and you know that's also where the bees

89
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,180
are feeding and so as we're starting to

90
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,400
scrutinize neonicotinoids and their use

91
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,840
and how them there might be some

92
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,180
interaction with pollinator health

93
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,400
having some alternative and if we can

94
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,800
find one within the plant that would be

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,930
an ideal solution

96
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,969
and we initially approach this how many

97
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,580
people have before starting to do some

98
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:59,109
field assays of beetle damage where you

99
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,959
can see there are some plants and some

100
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:04,060
plots that are green and thriving and

101
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,400
other plants where it's noticeably well

102
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,890
the plants are rather absent the bee

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,750
it'll just devour them to the ground and

104
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:12,759
as we sorted through this you know we

105
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,089
definitely focused originally on those

106
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:18,659
extremes and that's why we've shown a

107
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:22,109
few times before so on the top we have

108
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,560
success PMS straight next summer squash

109
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,720
developed here at Cornell by my predator

110
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,720
and

111
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,000
also very popular in organic systems

112
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,639
it's an organic seed is broadly

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,509
available this one on the bottom you see

114
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,819
a golden zucchini and this is a crop

115
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:42,918
where the beetles really prefer it

116
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:45,199
they've d foliated it and also in the

117
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:48,019
process the plants that escape that have

118
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,560
gotten bacterial will and then will die

119
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:52,668
from that and there's been a lot of

120
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,990
people have looked at from the

121
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:56,750
recommendations in trying to figure out

122
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,600
so what can a grower plant that's really

123
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,160
going to be able to give them a crop

124
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,750
that will be less vulnerable to these

125
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,310
beetles and they've often looked at

126
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,540
different cultivars that are popular at

127
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,689
the time

128
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,270
we took it one step further and looking

129
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:13,399
at all the different market classes and

130
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,439
the amount of defoliation damage we saw

131
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,449
there's definitely a trend and you can

132
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:21,560
order the market classes through

133
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:25,069
increased damage and further where the

134
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,478
biology really comes into play is it

135
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:30,168
turns out there is a really nice

136
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:32,779
demarcation in the middle where of all

137
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:35,418
these squash you eat pumpkins

138
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:38,329
jack-o'-lanterns pumpkins acorn squash

139
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:40,519
zucchini coca Zell there's two different

140
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:43,189
subspecies two separate domestication

141
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:47,089
events and there's a clear distinction

142
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:49,160
in preference based on the best same

143
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:51,769
subspecies klein so on the top you see

144
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,560
the summer squash that are getting very

145
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:57,529
little damage a member of the subsidy

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,310
fanon and the bottom the zucchini a part

147
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:02,719
of the people people and so how this

148
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,759
relates to some of the market class

149
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,020
questions is one thing it really comes

150
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,620
down to those two extremes I was showing

151
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:12,409
genetically they're very different

152
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,220
there's two the beetles they're very

153
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,200
different

154
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,120
to consumers there's still different but

155
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,930
you know to what degree could they

156
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,360
substitute right so here is that yellow

157
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,150
summer squash on the far side is a

158
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,330
golden Cikini you have two yellow summer

159
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:31,129
squash fruits once you put a less almac

160
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,050
marinade and put them on the grill you

161
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:35,689
know how different might they be but

162
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,129
still there is driving the marketplace

163
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:38,180
to have these two different market

164
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:40,790
classes

165
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,100
and use them differently or at least the

166
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,629
demand to have access to both and indeed

167
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,270
the zucchinis tend to be a little bit

168
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:50,089
more preferred in the marketplace which

169
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:51,319
is again a question that comes back to

170
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:52,429
the sustainability because the yellow

171
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,469
summer squash

172
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,000
they have multiple flowers print per

173
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,699
note are actually much higher yielding

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,350
so you have it's kind of the more

175
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:05,180
sustainable choice okay and further

176
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,040
looking at all of the different market

177
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,840
classes here will you see if her

178
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,330
breeders off and what we do is to try to

179
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,819
be able to continue to make progress and

180
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:16,069
most rapidly many people do conservative

181
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:19,699
crosses they you seldom see crosses

182
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:21,949
across the subspecies and often you'll

183
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,960
see crosses within a market class and so

184
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,960
the amount of gain you can stand to make

185
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,629
is you know quite narrow quite

186
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:32,719
restricted

187
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:34,909
but we have started doing many of those

188
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,650
crosses and so here's a population

189
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,660
between those two contrasting squash I

190
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:41,448
showed and you can see the selection

191
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,610
process here after lauren has gone to

192
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:46,520
the field and vacuumed up thousands of

193
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,870
beetles to put into these cages and you

194
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:49,549
can see there's some clear preference

195
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,649
differences as we have these segregating

196
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,228
populations some plants defoliated some

197
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:55,779
plants still have you know fledgeby's

198
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:59,329
full intact leaf

199
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:01,359
and so here so we're doing a cross

200
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:03,949
between the two and

201
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,800
one question we're going to have is so

202
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:09,168
at what point are we going to need are

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,379
we going to be close enough to a golden

204
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:13,848
zucchini and in this time they were

205
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:15,620
doing the breeding - you know what

206
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:17,389
extent can yellow summer school our

207
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,449
substitute in the marketplace it's

208
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:23,090
really a market class drive we're doing

209
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:25,250
here friends so in terms of being able

210
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:28,959
to have just a good summer squash it's

211
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:33,019
well there's already exists

212
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:35,329
the true alternative that we are very

213
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:36,829
excited to be starting to work on and

214
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,330
it's something where I myself need to be

215
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,839
kind of persuaded down this road to

216
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:44,360
explore this is an Italian summer squash

217
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,970
this is a trombone Chi know summer

218
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,589
squash they are part of the most shot of

219
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,019
species so rather than being between

220
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:53,900
those two subspecies its own species

221
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:56,389
and they they can be used as a winter

222
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:59,179
squash the butternut squash you might be

223
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:01,850
enjoying this week in addition they can

224
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:04,279
be used as a summer squash in our work

225
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:07,070
to look at some of the climate change

226
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,539
aspects we often have trials in the

227
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,190
southeast because that's a good

228
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:11,990
predictor of the climate we might have

229
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,110
to come and the growers are working

230
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,970
through many of those challenges now and

231
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,300
one of the key differences that makes

232
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,840
this from an chino more sustainable is

233
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:26,329
nearest to me on the right you have a

234
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,220
zucchini stem it is hollow and very

235
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,139
susceptible to squash vine borers they

236
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,930
get in that passageway they're very hard

237
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:34,909
to control once they get in on your left

238
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:37,069
you have the solid stem of one of these

239
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,389
mo shadow species so just naturally much

240
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,700
more resistant to the vine boards

241
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:42,620
because they can't really burrow in and

242
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,200
just have a subway system through the

243
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,820
plant

244
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,990
but this was the Trump and Chino is an

245
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,390
heirloom there's a lot of room to

246
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,970
improve and

247
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:54,679
so this is where we started to get some

248
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,750
of the great input from the team at Blue

249
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:58,219
Hill and chef Dan barber as we look

250
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,960
through to see so what are the

251
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,509
characteristics we do need to preserve

252
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,639
in these from and Chino squash as we

253
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:07,389
start to breed with them and then

254
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:11,439
understanding so how can they best be

255
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:13,580
displayed in a dish and so you have some

256
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,200
different uses where you find the

257
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,110
Tremonti no they're much more delicious

258
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,480
than a zucchini they have Laver and so

259
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,519
if you've ever thought about where its

260
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,899
flavor in zucchinis well there are some

261
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,059
classes that they do have some great

262
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:28,370
flavor but also here in a trump and

263
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:31,369
Chino you get a lot flavor there's a lot

264
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:35,360
of density to it and this became a very

265
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:37,090
popular offering there and this model is

266
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,409
something that we have

267
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:42,440
we're very optimistic for how it work

268
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:45,620
with the trombone Chino because of the

269
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:49,450
great success we've had in the past and

270
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:53,000
so the honey nut squash you know

271
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:55,190
hopefully no one enjoy now is here in

272
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,690
the bottom corner and it wasn't

273
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,940
something that originally took off

274
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,740
because it looked different than it's on

275
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,790
the marketplace the Trump and Chino is

276
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,220
going to look different than this squash

277
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:06,750
the growers we talked to that's one of

278
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,340
their major concerns is how are they

279
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,750
actually going to get in the marketplace

280
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,759
it's a crop they know that works for

281
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,940
them but so how do you get that culinary

282
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:18,450
trend to catch on well the the chef is

283
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:21,690
the key so Honey Nut is a small squash

284
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,339
it has a built-in ripeness indicator you

285
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,970
can tell when it's fully ripe that will

286
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:30,420
change from a green to an orange rind

287
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,830
and is much more delicious at least I

288
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:35,370
will tell you than any other flutter nut

289
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:37,830
squash you'll have and the key within

290
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,110
that is that it has a cross I was done

291
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,270
many years ago dick Robinson at Geneva

292
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,490
started the process Miley John continued

293
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:46,829
it but it's a cross between a butternut

294
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,100
squash and the Buttercup squash and that

295
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,120
yielded the honey nut squash which that

296
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,899
talked about some of the technical

297
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,870
aspects before this is an exciting crop

298
00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,169
both for how good it is itself and it's

299
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,879
much sweeter much smoother texture then

300
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:05,939
it was much of that to the Buttercup in

301
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,370
its pedigree but also it has about twice

302
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,020
the beta-carotene

303
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,360
more than three times the lutein again

304
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,750
as much alpha carotene so it's really a

305
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,669
neutral and antioxidant nutrient

306
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,769
powerhouse there and it's also been

307
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:22,679
serving the basis for further genomic

308
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:25,319
selection work we've been doing the the

309
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:28,859
reason it had some challenges getting

310
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,780
into the marketplace and the kind of

311
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,389
what's helping it now is that its

312
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:35,338
distinctive right and so it's smaller

313
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:37,519
has the orange rind if you're growing

314
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,290
your garden starting out dark green

315
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,629
so it took a while for that to catch on

316
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:45,838
it was getting that popularized so then

317
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:47,570
when it did catch on now we're getting a

318
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,820
privilege it's normally reserved for

319
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,740
apple cultivars where it's sold by name

320
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,920
in the grocery store that had the SKU

321
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,450
code that's specific to it and so all

322
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,939
the work we've done in Vienna crates on

323
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,040
it's really delicious has is

324
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,750
identifiable so consumers can go back to

325
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,539
find it experience and they can know

326
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,309
when it's ripen at its peak is all

327
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:11,129
coming together and this is something we

328
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:13,139
can do hopefully for many of the other

329
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:14,220
they work on the ripeness indicators

330
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:16,169
that trend were putting into all our

331
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,149
squash it's really hard to tell whether

332
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:20,449
a butternut squash is ripe or not

333
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:22,620
otherwise and

334
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,840
also just an example of one of the

335
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,830
trends that we now know we can drive a

336
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,790
couple others where we are

337
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,490
recreating some crops that don't

338
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:35,909
necessarily fit in the existing molds is

339
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:39,379
our work with some purple snow peas and

340
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:42,659
so this is exciting to us for the color

341
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:44,399
there's a of course in the antioxidant

342
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:47,819
boost that comes with the anthocyanins

343
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,980
and associated flavonoids but these are

344
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,300
a little different and they're a little

345
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,870
different because they're not a

346
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:56,459
perfectly straight and so in pee

347
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,429
breeding a lot of effort has gone into

348
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:03,210
making the pods perfectly straight the

349
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:05,399
challenge we find when it comes to you

350
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,830
know beyond incorporate them into food

351
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,899
is whether you have a few of those in a

352
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,820
stir fry it works very well it's pretty

353
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,500
they mix in but once you start to add

354
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,379
more than a certain amount they start to

355
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,820
look a little bit like the truckloads of

356
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:19,590
firewood that might have been dropped

357
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,360
off at your houses so there's just you

358
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,180
have that pile of them and they all just

359
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,909
kind of stack together

360
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:29,519
these as you can see have a curl to them

361
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:31,529
they have this wavy nature that actually

362
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,509
is really cool initially because it

363
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:35,250
gives them loft and so they just have

364
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:37,409
much more presence appearance on the

365
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,929
plate and as you are starting to work

366
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,879
with them share it it is actually just

367
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:44,069
something that's more interesting to

368
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,419
work with and present in addition to all

369
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,960
the work we've done on getting the

370
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:51,649
flavor to be sweet and overcome some of

371
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,650
the stringency of those purple flavors

372
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:57,480
there's some often some bitterness and

373
00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:00,480
astringency associated with the

374
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,509
accumulation anthocyanins and crops the

375
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,759
other example where we just having fun

376
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:08,669
and creating new types of in this case

377
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,559
peppers and so just trying to do some

378
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:13,589
things to really increase the market

379
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:16,199
appeal you see those little snacking

380
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:18,840
peppers that you'll see increasingly on

381
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,740
the vegetable trays you have a gathering

382
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:24,889
it's great to see that they are one the

383
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,200
first one first vegetables to go off the

384
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:29,360
tray but we can think we can increase

385
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,490
the consumption even more the vitamin C

386
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,039
content in these is also through the

387
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:36,919
roof and so there's this novelty and

388
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:39,370
looking at flavor and quality and then

389
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:42,319
also being able to capture some insect

390
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,179
disease resistance with the Trump in

391
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,740
Chino

392
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:48,459
there's also work we do on another

393
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,899
pathogen q Corbett downy mildew

394
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:55,370
this there's a lot of this work I do

395
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:57,799
with Chris smart and the resistance we

396
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,528
had to downy mildew it wasn't really an

397
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,838
issue for many growers for quite a few

398
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:04,820
years for a few decades there was some

399
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,600
resistance and been bred into held

400
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:11,480
really well the challenge we faced is we

401
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,430
started to get some new races some new

402
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,990
strains of the pathogen that we're

403
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:17,899
starting to overcome the existing

404
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,909
resistance and so you'll have some

405
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:24,169
telltale symptoms on a cucumber leaf and

406
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:26,689
then once it occurs an area it rapidly

407
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:29,629
the fully it's the crop and so on the

408
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,940
bottom left you can see just a little

409
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:34,070
bit over just ten days of disease

410
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,620
progress for this pathogen so once it

411
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:39,980
moves in you go from having a productive

412
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,659
crop to nothing very quickly now all the

413
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,459
downy mildew resistant cultivars that

414
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:45,579
were out on the market you know the

415
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:49,159
pathogen has overcome their resistance

416
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:52,009
and toward that we've hard to do some

417
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:53,778
this isn't working Peter Oh jumbo in

418
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:55,580
North Carolina and looking at how we can

419
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:57,169
track the pathogen you know one thing

420
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,420
you can see it's going to retrieve to

421
00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:02,120
the east coast we can watch how it moves

422
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:04,279
through the year and with some special

423
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,140
emphasis with has been in from the major

424
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:07,879
area than the Carolinas in Michigan

425
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,429
where a lot of the production happens

426
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,620
and then up in our area in New York it

427
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,720
always often arrives later but this is a

428
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:17,588
pathogen that's being dispersed it is

429
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,670
probably overwintering in

430
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:21,948
protected structures around Michigan

431
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:24,500
where as we try to have this global

432
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,329
continual supply of cucumbers year round

433
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,819
that leads to we're growing cucumbers

434
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:32,329
year round in the pad the gin is present

435
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:35,210
year-round and especially as tropical

436
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:37,339
storms move up the East Coast as those

437
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,889
increase we often get much more and

438
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:43,490
sooner the dispersal of downy mildew up

439
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:45,798
the coast and so you know this is a

440
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,710
pathogen that then interacts with some

441
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:51,619
of our food system issues on a large

442
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,620
scale and the most direct way you would

443
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:57,528
interact with it is if you were growing

444
00:17:54,619 --> 00:18:00,199
cucumbers in the fall you'll see that

445
00:17:57,528 --> 00:18:03,138
your plants just quickly die in all the

446
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,600
regional local food markets all the

447
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:07,219
cucumber's are lost at some point in the

448
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,230
fall not just because of you know the

449
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,999
frost of the season is ending up but you

450
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,798
know this passage is moving in and the

451
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:14,889
fungicides are losing their efficacy as

452
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:18,589
it continues to rapidly evolve

453
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:21,769
so we've been excited when we can be

454
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:24,589
able to have a major change in disease

455
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:26,839
resistance for this so our two most

456
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:27,829
resistant varieties on the top so

457
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,109
varieties that are now commercially

458
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:31,460
available talked about now

459
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,558
compared to some of the other options

460
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,298
growers had as they turn to something

461
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,099
that had improved downy mildew

462
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:39,679
resistance or was just one of these

463
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:41,418
heirlooms you know a typical crop they

464
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,409
had been cucumber called bard they had

465
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:46,879
been growing and

466
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:48,889
excitingly also and as I showed you that

467
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:52,819
map of how downy mildew is coming up the

468
00:18:48,888 --> 00:18:54,648
East Coast this is a trial of the

469
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:57,499
beautiful location our collaborator

470
00:18:54,648 --> 00:19:01,099
Janine Davis has in North Carolina and

471
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:03,019
you can see in the foreground as downy

472
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:05,109
mildew starts to move in and take out

473
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:08,269
our cucumber and melon pots behind it

474
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:11,778
you can see the this site I was

475
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:14,690
overjoyed to see as I pulled in is the

476
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:16,638
arrows show you the green patches so

477
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,409
these are our resist and cucumber

478
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,490
cultivars so it's bred in New York but

479
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:21,710
it's not as something that works in New

480
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,899
York it's something that is also really

481
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,700
holding up in some of the severe disease

482
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:29,418
pressures in some of the main cucumber

483
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:32,808
producing regions in the nation and with

484
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:36,019
this and one of the the back stories

485
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:38,118
with it that is exciting is often is

486
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:41,089
people think about the time line four

487
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:44,778
introducing a new cultivar so for us

488
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:47,298
this new downy mildew resistant line 401

489
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:50,298
it's something that I've showed in some

490
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:51,589
other talks is a much higher yielding

491
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:54,710
when downy mildew is there of course

492
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:59,538
it's still alive but also has some

493
00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:02,440
competitive earliness in the initial

494
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:05,658
cross we did in 2012 to take what was a

495
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,298
later but robust disease resistant

496
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:10,460
breeding line this a 264 cross it to

497
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:12,970
Dasher which is one of the most commonly

498
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:16,038
grown slicing cucumbers around

499
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:19,489
that cross in 2012 we were doing

500
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:20,808
selections in the field in 2013 we can

501
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:22,700
have the benefit of a couple of

502
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:26,989
generations a year using the greenhouse

503
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:29,960
face we had a a selection that we were

504
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:32,389
really confident about in 2015 was out

505
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,970
in a couple of trials as a really

506
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:38,689
preliminary stage

507
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:41,358
the our release just came out last week

508
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:44,210
and so the publication of its existence

509
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:46,460
is just coming out and also there's a

510
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,769
seed company that has it licensed did a

511
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,269
see production this summer and so this

512
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:52,700
is something that we started the process

513
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:54,378
in 2012 it's going to be available to

514
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,139
growers or the specific focus on the

515
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:59,028
southeast where they really need it most

516
00:20:56,138 --> 00:21:01,699
next summer and so this is a really

517
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:03,558
rapid response system where is it really

518
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,419
fully finished can we do more with it

519
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:06,769
certainly we're going to keep working on

520
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:08,538
it that's in part why we're giving them

521
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:10,190
these numbered lines and not names yet

522
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:12,558
because these are still going to be

523
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,349
works in progress but that doesn't mean

524
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,690
that a grower can't really benefit from

525
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:19,759
having this tool on their farms now

526
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,139
right and so we've just continued to

527
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,058
release things as soon as we have

528
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:24,798
something we know is an improvement it's

529
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:26,558
hard to fast-track that get it out to

530
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:30,229
the growers

531
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:32,648
and so and while that is something we're

532
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:34,609
proud of and seems fast on that scale

533
00:21:32,648 --> 00:21:37,908
there's also something that could be

534
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:40,038
even faster some of the sources for

535
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:42,919
downy mildew resistance we're using are

536
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:45,378
things that are our cultivars that are

537
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:47,840
well know their cultivars depending on

538
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:49,928
where you are in the world that was the

539
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,250
seat that was the key to much of our

540
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:53,750
resistance breeding is taking different

541
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,819
cultivars that had moderate resistance

542
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:59,230
bringing that together and getting an

543
00:21:55,819 --> 00:22:01,669
even higher level of resistance and

544
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,710
looking through some of these cultivars

545
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,830
you'll see there's some Chinese

546
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,450
cultivars that are in growing in parts

547
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:13,308
of the world where these pathogens are

548
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:15,740
endemic there are also Indian cultivars

549
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:16,639
that are also being grown in parts of

550
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,819
the world with some of these pathogens

551
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,490
are endemic and so these are existing

552
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:26,419
cultivars that are fit with existing

553
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:28,759
cuisines around the world and while we

554
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,039
can spend a lot of time adapting these

555
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:33,079
doing some breeding to be able to kind

556
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,940
of take that resistance and intrigue

557
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:38,119
resset into some of the market classes

558
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:40,910
we enjoy there's also the potential for

559
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:42,129
these to be enjoyed right now and to

560
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:45,170
help to

561
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,880
diversify to share more broadly this how

562
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,830
well they might do the many have

563
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,679
excellent yield these in high tunnel

564
00:22:48,829 --> 00:22:54,019
open field trials with them and the

565
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,250
flavor is great sometimes the flavor is

566
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,990
different sometimes it needs to be used

567
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,960
differently in the kitchen but these are

568
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:03,079
still cucumbers that can be grown now

569
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,370
and enjoyed at least while we are at

570
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:06,289
certain times of season when it's

571
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:08,779
difficult to grow the other cultivars or

572
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:11,000
while we are continuing to make it into

573
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:13,009
to do the breeding process to introduce

574
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,769
the resistance into the market classes

575
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:19,099
we enjoy

576
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:20,720
and so that's really looking at some of

577
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:24,129
those aspects of the breeding process

578
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:28,299
and where we can interact

579
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:30,920
another opportunity and that has

580
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:33,799
increasingly drawn attention so here's a

581
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:38,870
study by the NRDC is just looking at the

582
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:41,319
amount of produce that is harvested and

583
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:44,928
then just never really makes it

584
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:47,119
into you know well into our diets and

585
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:49,330
never makes it into our bellies and a

586
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:53,419
variety of reasons sometimes it is

587
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:55,279
oversupply and so there's often to make

588
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,830
sure you a grower can meet a contract

589
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,720
they will produce more just to make sure

590
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:02,809
they can have that supply

591
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,600
much of what's over produced my end up

592
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:08,509
in a landfill something that doesn't

593
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:10,939
look like you might be expecting to fit

594
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:14,420
that market class concept might end up

595
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:16,460
in a landfill and so as we've been

596
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,950
starting to look at some of the

597
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:22,299
different ways we can improve this again

598
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:25,400
we've taken the lead from

599
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:28,960
our great collaborator chef Dan barber

600
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,769
and this is his salad

601
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,809
collaboration with sweet greens that's

602
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,690
been a big inspiration to us and how we

603
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:38,329
start to think about

604
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:40,820
also how we can change some of the

605
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:45,069
attributes we're breeding for okay and

606
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:48,200
so this is their their salad where it is

607
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:49,849
essentially the what you might have left

608
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,259
over on your cutting board after you

609
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:56,959
make a salad and so it is broccoli stems

610
00:24:54,259 --> 00:25:00,650
carrot peel you see the leaves from some

611
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,110
of the brassicas that actually do make a

612
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:07,550
fine salad these are they're all edible

613
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:09,259
parts and this was celebrated in a salad

614
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,839
at sweet greens where it ran for a wild

615
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:14,240
is really looking at even as we have the

616
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,799
harvested of plant parts that come in

617
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,160
and whether we are not we choose to use

618
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:21,109
them how can we be able to change our

619
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,330
approaches to be able to use more of

620
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:25,429
that and so you know there's part of it

621
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:27,679
that can happen through culinary trends

622
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,600
and how consumers the public approaches

623
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,690
what to do with the produce they bring

624
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:35,059
home and it can be you know introduced

625
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:37,130
to them in these ways but also for me as

626
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:39,319
a plant breeder we start been

627
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,570
increasingly starting to think about so

628
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:44,750
what about all these other components of

629
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:47,119
the produce that I'm not selecting for

630
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:50,240
so I'm always selecting for the best

631
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,009
fruit quality and as I try to get over

632
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,599
the hurdle the trombone chino and how

633
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:56,240
that was something that wasn't really

634
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,980
fitting with my concept of what I was

635
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,710
going for in a butternut squash we're

636
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,920
going for a straight next small really

637
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:06,049
sweet then to be introduced to this long

638
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,670
windy squash it and it took a little

639
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:10,099
while for me to be able to really

640
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,090
realize the potential of doing the

641
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:14,619
breeding work within how release it into

642
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:18,819
the food system in a more sustainable

643
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:22,539
choice so looking at the under

644
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:24,339
appreciated components in this salad the

645
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,409
part where it's kind of come home to

646
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:29,199
some of the breeding and selection I've

647
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:31,750
been doing is I find myself going

648
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,940
through a squash field tasting more

649
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:38,339
parts of the plant than I ever would

650
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:41,289
have imagined even a year ago

651
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:43,299
then barber started to tell me how it

652
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:46,450
was you know I should be doing this and

653
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:48,220
how we would be you know and how there's

654
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,279
this potential to breathe for the flavor

655
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,380
of the stems of a squash plant the leaf

656
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,930
petioles and

657
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:58,240
again this was something where he helped

658
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:01,660
me really kind of think more broadly

659
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,359
about what we could be selecting for and

660
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:07,720
for me the what converted me was

661
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:12,240
sampling the dish so the nearest to me

662
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:16,120
is a cue carpet people penne pasta where

663
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,759
there is the leaf petioles of the squash

664
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:21,639
plants that are prepared if you look for

665
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:24,420
a gluten-free pasta now this is 100%

666
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,370
gluten-free it's just the leaf petioles

667
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,380
but you know there's variation within

668
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:32,500
squash so some actually don't taste very

669
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:36,010
good some are okay and some actually do

670
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:38,319
have good flavor and so as I've gone

671
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:40,930
through the field and doing oscillations

672
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,679
one of the key places you can really see

673
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:47,340
this can impact sustainability is

674
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:52,120
at the end of the season here's a

675
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:53,829
panorama of a squash field and you can

676
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:57,219
see on the side nearest me on the right

677
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:59,589
you see the typical loss that plants are

678
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,329
succumbing to powdery mildew even the

679
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:04,329
spider breeding efforts at some point

680
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:07,509
they senescent go down there's also some

681
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:09,429
other species from other parts of the

682
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:12,940
world that I have growing on the Left

683
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:14,740
these are naturally adapted species and

684
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,600
some of the the breeding work we start

685
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,700
to do with them and you can just see

686
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:23,859
they are still green vibrant growing

687
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:25,840
this was at my house in October you

688
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:27,579
could only imagine it a little bit more

689
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,909
milder part of New York they would have

690
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:34,139
been growing just fine probably up until

691
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:37,150
maybe well today last night

692
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:39,040
and so this is a poem you know so the

693
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,380
ground is being used it's being planted

694
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,240
growers can harvest the fruits but you

695
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,640
know at the end of the season or as they

696
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,339
are just having a succession of plants

697
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,870
there's really a lot of food out there

698
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:53,289
in the field and so as we've gone

699
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:55,779
through and learned how to be able to do

700
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:57,399
some of the sampling or kind of realize

701
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:59,190
that this is a great thing that we can

702
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,710
do

703
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,720
you know it you can only have some some

704
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,370
benefits

705
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,160
and so there's also an emphasis on

706
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:10,199
Lawrence right so I learned this from a

707
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,970
chef

708
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,860
you know and so this sort of approach in

709
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,079
some of the cultivars we're using it's

710
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:19,959
something that's not new to the world

711
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:22,240
and so in many parts of the world you

712
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,480
know this is part of the culture this is

713
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,359
part of the cuisine these plants are

714
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,259
eaten the whole plant in many other

715
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:34,869
different countries and so for us it's

716
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:37,049
been a matter of kind of learning those

717
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:40,329
cultures learning those traditions

718
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:42,849
appreciating the value they have and how

719
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:46,169
it contributes to sustainability food

720
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:48,309
access and those parts of the world and

721
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:51,759
just kind of really starting to enjoy

722
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:54,059
and celebrate those opportunities and

723
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:57,250
for us of course as a plant breeder

724
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:58,599
there's also as we look into some of

725
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,279
these crops they're growing much warmer

726
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:02,379
parts of the world still there's an

727
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:05,139
opportunity to adapt them to more thrive

728
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,190
in our parts of northern North East it

729
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,840
will be very different from where

730
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,850
they're originally grown right but so

731
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,279
this is learning from other cultures

732
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:14,519
kind of getting some more diversity in

733
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:17,470
and being able to

734
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,269
appreciate some of the the plants now as

735
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:20,589
they are as they come from many

736
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:22,210
different places of the world and

737
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:24,549
there's definitely some breeding that

738
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:27,430
can be done but also as value as they

739
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:31,240
are and so the kind of some of the

740
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:32,220
themes I try I wanted to focus on today

741
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,180
is

742
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:37,980
its be able to be have a more efficient

743
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,779
breeding process you know there's an

744
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,089
opportunity cost and waiting until

745
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:44,039
something is finished and restricting

746
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:46,500
ourselves to this is exactly how it

747
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:48,599
needs to look in the marketplace so what

748
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,000
what diversity what potential is there

749
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:54,779
to have uniqueness and how can it be

750
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,200
used to actually drive consumption and

751
00:30:54,779 --> 00:31:00,180
so increasingly some of the approaches

752
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,009
we use as we look and how to take

753
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:05,549
something that's working well now and

754
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:08,250
just get ready access to a grower so on

755
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:10,470
farm trials as pilot production and so

756
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:12,660
as we start to do our own farm trial

757
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,490
work there's often an idea that whoa Kay

758
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,009
it'll be available later when it's

759
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:18,900
commercialized as we can commercialize

760
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:20,579
some of the cultivars some of the

761
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,950
breeding lines that are actually doing

762
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:25,049
well now that gives growers immediate

763
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,250
access to it we're not gonna have them

764
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,470
risk their whole farms to it but they

765
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,180
can certainly be able to take a portion

766
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,910
of their land and be able to have

767
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,529
something that might work better and

768
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,960
work into more land for it as we

769
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:38,039
continue to improve it and that's

770
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,279
because it's before it's finished

771
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:43,769
cultivars there's often some value

772
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:46,170
reading for reduced waste learning from

773
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:47,759
other food cultures on you know what are

774
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,710
the other plants parts of use how are

775
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,779
they consumed what makes them delicious

776
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:53,460
how can we be able to look at what we're

777
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:55,230
growing and be able to apply some of the

778
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,360
same and also maybe try some of those

779
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:01,650
cultivars here to see what we can do to

780
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:04,379
introduce those and with that as we can

781
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:07,920
get some culinary trends led by a chef

782
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:11,100
to look at how we can be able to take

783
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:14,190
those cultivars or adapted now are

784
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:16,289
working really well and be able to

785
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:19,080
hopefully start some culinary transit

786
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:20,879
can embrace that diversity because those

787
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:22,470
are things we can eat now that will have

788
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,170
a much greater sustainability

789
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:28,380
even before the breeding process starts

790
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:29,880
here and to really embrace the breeding

791
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,530
process that's been going on for the

792
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,780
many years to get it to the state it was

793
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:35,480
as we experienced it from those other

794
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:39,359
parts of the world

795
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,829
and so with that I like to thank the

796
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,538
graduate students in my lab I showed

797
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:47,119
clay work Lauren Brazil ski former

798
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:49,609
postdoc Brian lucky and a fantastic

799
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:52,849
group of graduate students and postdocs

800
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:56,240
in the lab some great technical support

801
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:58,819
to make everything come together and a

802
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,099
big thanks to chef Dan barber at Blue

803
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:02,960
Hill that's really led us as we've

804
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:04,069
learned to explore things explore

805
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,579
vegetables a little bit more bravely

806
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:10,278
than we were before and lots of great

807
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:12,139
collaborators that have helped us that

808
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:14,119
have helped or we've helped with some

809
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:18,288
there's aspects of I've shown and a

810
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:19,989
great support from USDA nifA and some

811
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:26,379
other funders thank you

812
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:26,380
[Applause]

813
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:35,759
nope yeah yeah yeah

814
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:48,599
yeah it's from 2012 to 2017 yeah sure

815
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,600
did I skip one

816
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:58,480
well no so we're getting two generations

817
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,759
a year there this so the the cucumber we

818
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,380
can get multiple generations a year we

819
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:06,759
can even squeeze it to three and and

820
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:10,110
yeah and so that's what really helps us

821
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:12,099
be able to push it forward quickly

822
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:15,720
yep

823
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:15,719
Zack and then Marcus yeah

824
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:30,140
yeah and I guess maybe I should repeat

825
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:33,449
the questions and so the question about

826
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:35,639
if there is hazards in rushing something

827
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:38,659
to a grower and if there might be some

828
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:43,230
more durable resistances other progress

829
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:45,869
so I think the it is in kind of rushing

830
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,880
it to a grower I think the the

831
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:50,369
considerations are you know they might

832
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:53,730
be losing production out they might have

833
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:55,799
given up on a crop completely as we talk

834
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,010
to some growers in the southeast they've

835
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,080
given up on summer squash zucchini

836
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:03,980
entirely and so in that system being

837
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:06,150
able to share something that might work

838
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,980
and we won't suggest so plant their

839
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,590
whole farm too that that would be a huge

840
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,619
risk but you know to put in a row and

841
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:16,079
see how it does and so it is really

842
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:18,630
those exploratory plots kind of getting

843
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,400
them at a scale an appropriate scale

844
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,619
where they can be introducing them to

845
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,269
their production and also at the same

846
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,489
time then they have enough to test

847
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:28,469
market and kind of and start to be able

848
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:29,909
to build their following before they

849
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:31,889
take something new and novel and

850
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:33,899
introduced in a large scale so it does

851
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:36,769
have to be balanced but I think it works

852
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,769
and Marcus

853
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:57,680
yeah and I think it's in terms of you

854
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:01,460
know culinary trends you know start so

855
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:04,009
kale was it you know so that's chef

856
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:06,619
driven trend you know I think the baby

857
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:09,170
leaf lettuce you know and how that's a

858
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:10,639
like similar to the teas and so you know

859
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:13,539
that's something that provides law so

860
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:16,460
loft to a salad so as we moved away from

861
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:18,259
iceberg lettuce to all these baby greens

862
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,079
it's something that's actually much more

863
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,850
sustainable for a grower it gives them

864
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,139
more some opportunity so you know how

865
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:26,000
many farms do we see now with high

866
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:27,769
tunnels that are growing greens

867
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,199
year-round and they're not just doing

868
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:33,170
one market class or type you know they

869
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:35,599
have multiple different species families

870
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:37,280
brassicas are being mixed in and so

871
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,409
there's great diversity at least going

872
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,900
in and so you know that's something that

873
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:44,349
got a lot of its push from the chef

874
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,349
community

875
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:52,120
yeah any questions in Geneva

876
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,119
yeah

877
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:09,460
well the

878
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:12,760
well we have been working with some seed

879
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:16,059
companies that are can kind of see a

880
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:20,050
real critical a way to address a need

881
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:22,599
now and so some of these are are ending

882
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:25,000
out in more regional seed companies that

883
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,670
do not need to have you know thousands

884
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,409
of pounds of seed but can do it at much

885
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:32,800
smaller scale and be able to kind of get

886
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:34,629
it out now so as we have field days

887
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,000
throughout the southeast its attended by

888
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:38,769
many of the southeast seed companies

889
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,019
many of those are picking up so these

890
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:42,579
varieties now is it they can see it's

891
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:44,340
starting to work well in a region in

892
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:49,090
need and

893
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:51,660
their seed production can also be kind

894
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:56,079
of their last proof in the trial

895
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:58,690
so but yeah so it's otherwise it is yeah

896
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,250
being able to convince someone to take

897
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,619
the plunge and something radically new

898
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,650
that's why we need somewhere the pull

899
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:06,819
through help sure

900
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,300
anything else from Geneva before I move

901
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,309
to a couple here

902
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,430
yeah

903
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:14,429
Hey Bruce

904
00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:24,909
yep

905
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,860
yep

906
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:39,930
yeah sure and and I I didn't focus on on

907
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,420
it here there's a

908
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:44,559
campaign I did a talk in plant breeding

909
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:48,130
couple weeks ago they're really focused

910
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:50,650
on much of that and so that should be up

911
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,180
on YouTube now so again for the people

912
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:56,530
on the screen at home it'll be hopefully

913
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:59,079
in the list there but so a lot of the

914
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:02,650
work we're doing there is so genomic

915
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:04,840
selection is a really great in promising

916
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,970
tool for us right now and so we've been

917
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,530
doing genomic selection for quality and

918
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:11,649
winter squash the next step is store

919
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:15,100
ability because we'll have that the

920
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:17,230
whole debris the whole crop cycle is one

921
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:20,139
year to be able to fully evaluate the

922
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,269
storage of those to go from and when we

923
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:24,250
plant them to when the last ones come

924
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:28,900
out of storage and so that's going to be

925
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:31,570
a huge help we will be looking at the

926
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:35,050
true the games we've been able to make

927
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:37,630
next summer but so far it's it's very

928
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:42,190
it's very promising and we're seeing the

929
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:44,230
games being made and so and again that's

930
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,639
one that kind of fits in as we've had

931
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,530
the intermediates in the genomic

932
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:49,960
selection process we've been

933
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:52,840
distributing a lot of butternut squash

934
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,690
from that which are all I think

935
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,789
hopefully being received very well and

936
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:00,730
so they're already high-quality they are

937
00:39:57,789 --> 00:40:03,279
diverse there's mixtures of fruits sizes

938
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:05,670
and some qualities and shapes but

939
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,490
there's still very high quality produce

940
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:11,230
and the other majors with the stripe

941
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:14,739
kubera beetle starting to look at the

942
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:17,800
genomic context so what is the reason

943
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:20,759
for that subspecies difference in in

944
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:24,940
beetle preference and we've been

945
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:27,160
focusing on f2 populations by parental

946
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,559
populations because the population

947
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:31,779
structure for an association study

948
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:34,739
precludes that we are studying the sub

949
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:37,210
structure and so we had to mix that up

950
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:40,239
but so we've done that coupled with

951
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:42,389
starting to look at RNA seek to see what

952
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:45,339
and using some of the new 3-prime

953
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:47,949
quantitative methods to look at you know

954
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,900
the gene response for beetle feeding and

955
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:51,989
what's going on between those you kurby

956
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:55,030
tason's and

957
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:58,259
also just some other volatiles and other

958
00:40:55,030 --> 00:41:01,420
maybe anti feed and metabolites and

959
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:04,240
the thing that we're very proud of and I

960
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,940
was just accepted this morning the

961
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:10,029
powdery mildew resistance that was

962
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,250
famously done by Henry Munger here at

963
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:15,130
Cornell

964
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:17,469
4q cucurbits so moving the wild species

965
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:21,910
introgression from the Q curve Itamar an

966
00:41:17,469 --> 00:41:24,309
easy I into Mossad ax and pepo and a key

967
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:27,519
attribute and much of the brain has been

968
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:29,860
done here so we're the first to have a

969
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:33,519
published publicly available marker

970
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:35,950
that's so far completely Co segregates

971
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,619
with the trait and we were very excited

972
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:40,809
about how we did that approach because

973
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:42,369
rather than creating a lot of

974
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:43,929
populations for ourselves we just took

975
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:47,259
advantage of the populations that were

976
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:49,539
already there and so as we had that

977
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,970
resistance gene that Henry Munger did

978
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:54,250
and shared throughout the world dozens

979
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:55,929
of breeding companies hundreds of plant

980
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:58,210
breeders working on that for probably

981
00:41:55,929 --> 00:42:01,809
millions of meiosis and as we've been

982
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:03,699
able to just genotype what's resulted

983
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:07,599
from that the one region they share in

984
00:42:03,699 --> 00:42:10,389
common is a 75 KB interval about 75 KB

985
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,949
with a couple really promising candidate

986
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:13,719
genes and we're now following up so

987
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:17,379
those are the types of studies we're

988
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:19,509
doing it's a via another video that kind

989
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,820
of summarizes all those but and this was

990
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,260
really just looking at some of the the

991
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:26,559
art behind it and some of the other

992
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,600
opportunities to change how we do what

993
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,500
is otherwise

994
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,339
and kind of an established pipeline

995
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,269
thanks Bruce

996
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,269
yeah Rachel

997
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:40,769
mm-hmm

998
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:46,118
yeah

999
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:49,108
this is the zucchini say that that

1000
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:49,108
subspecies yeah

1001
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,239
mm-hmm

1002
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:13,819
yeah so yeah so the question here was as

1003
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:16,489
we're crossing these two and we are

1004
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:19,130
trying to go toward being able to put

1005
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:21,969
the non-preference from the summer

1006
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:25,010
squash into the

1007
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:26,299
more consumer preferred market class of

1008
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,090
the golden zucchini how are we going to

1009
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,670
know when we're close enough

1010
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:34,670
so that will be something that will be

1011
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:36,530
on part up to kind of consumers and as

1012
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,000
we're sharing some of the intermediates

1013
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:41,030
with growers if they are being in a

1014
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,409
market there are some subtle flavor

1015
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:44,030
differences there are some other

1016
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:48,019
characters who might come along for the

1017
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:50,720
ride we can it will probably in the end

1018
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:54,108
just be a match of the visuals if we

1019
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:55,699
kind of converted it over but and also

1020
00:43:54,108 --> 00:43:57,670
you know there are some culinary

1021
00:43:55,699 --> 00:44:00,639
differences that we can also

1022
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:05,619
rotate will taste a lot of squash yeah

1023
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,618
thanks is a time for remote yeah

1024
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,280
yep

1025
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:25,100
yeah and so there's a

1026
00:44:21,489 --> 00:44:28,339
conference in 2013 that really helped

1027
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:30,769
get a lot of that going and kind of a

1028
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:33,710
much greater visibility to the potential

1029
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:36,679
there so yeah it's increasingly you'd

1030
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:38,630
see the the chef breeder interaction

1031
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:40,429
going which has been really exciting and

1032
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:42,950
you know it's it's a way to be able to

1033
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:45,319
you know capture the creativity from

1034
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:47,809
both sides and be able to work directly

1035
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:50,930
so there's actually two ends of the

1036
00:44:47,809 --> 00:44:52,570
process that are coming together and

1037
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:55,569
Hannah did use the other

1038
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:55,570
okay

1039
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:03,490
you know and I think then the the thing

1040
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:08,060
I'd be arguing is to what extent can we

1041
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:10,429
do to move beyond that of it and so and

1042
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:14,259
just have it so what other is people

1043
00:45:10,429 --> 00:45:16,940
think about creating new market classes

1044
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:19,610
is kind of it when is something just

1045
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:21,320
great as it is and Ken Hakeem can

1046
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:23,000
introduce that and that was with the

1047
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,610
honey nut squash you know a miniature

1048
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,710
butternut squash was not not something

1049
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:29,840
that really fit into the market is small

1050
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:31,579
and looked different in it it tasted

1051
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,260
really good but it wasn't until people

1052
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:35,980
really got introduced to it that they

1053
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,980
got popularized

1054
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,729
