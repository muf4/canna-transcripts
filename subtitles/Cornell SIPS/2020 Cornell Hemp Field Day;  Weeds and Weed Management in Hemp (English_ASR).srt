00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,199
hello

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,798
welcome to my talk about weeds in weed

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,720
management and hemp

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,638
my name is lynn sisnoski and i'm an

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,440
assistant professor of weed biology

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:13,518
ecology

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:17,439
and management and specialty crops here

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:20,160
at cornell university

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,600
weeds in any cropping system compete

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,359
with the crop for water

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,960
nutrients and light and that can

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,000
directly impact

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,920
yield quantity and quality

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,678
weeds that become established in crops

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,000
can alter the microclimates

16
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,759
around the plants which can then impact

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,359
disease development

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,439
and weeds can actually serve as

19
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,640
alternate hosts for both pests and

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:45,280
pathogens in car cropping systems

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,679
vegetation that isn't controlled can

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,640
reduce the final harvestability of the

23
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,320
crop

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,480
and the absence of any kind of

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,600
vegetation control chemicals

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,398
in the hemp crop itself may necessitate

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,120
the use of

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,679
multiple and integrated practices to

29
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,718
suppress

30
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,400
weeds that become established

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,079
with respect to integrated weed

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,240
management and hemp

33
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,438
the first step should always be proper

34
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,438
site selection

35
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,359
and that means avoiding fields with

36
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,079
perennials or extremely

37
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,959
high weed densities if you're going to

38
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,158
start clean

39
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:22,798
make sure to try and stay clean always

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,159
manage and harvest your cleanest fields

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,400
first

42
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,359
with respect to planting date you might

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,240
be able to plant and get ahead of weeds

44
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,159
for example if the field that you're

45
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,359
planting into has a lot

46
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,439
of summer emerging weed species

47
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,680
choose an earlier planting date that

48
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,078
allows your crop to get up and gives it

49
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,920
some kind of competitive advantage

50
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,679
against the vegetation it's going to be

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,079
competing with

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,560
using a stale seed bed technique where

53
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:55,519
you stimulate the germination

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
of weeds and then eliminate emerge

55
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,959
ceilings both

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,478
physically and chemically can be a

57
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,399
really useful tool

58
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,718
but understand that not all weeds are

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,920
going to respond equally well

60
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,280
species with non-dormant seeds might be

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,280
better controlled

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,959
under this strategy as opposed to

63
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,959
species with dormant seeds

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,159
make sure that you have the best

65
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,560
planting conditions that you can achieve

66
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,919
for instance making sure you have a nice

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,000
even seed bed

68
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,479
so that you have good soil to seed

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,719
contact for even germination

70
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,159
which will improve the crops competitive

71
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,680
ability

72
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,079
make sure that you plant with

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,200
appropriate densities to minimize that

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,120
open space that weeds can then colonize

75
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,679
if you're using transplants this can be

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,080
a really useful strategy to give your

77
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,519
crop a competitive size advantage over

78
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,319
the weeds

79
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,080
choosing varieties can have an influence

80
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:55,199
on how competitive the crop

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,719
is as well based on the heights and the

82
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,158
branching traits that that

83
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:02,158
varieties possesses if you're going to

84
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,079
be cultivating make sure you keep your

85
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,120
rows as straight as possible

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,680
to maximize cultivation performance

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,439
and get the weeds while they are small

88
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,480
either at the white thread

89
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:17,039
or the early seedling stages

90
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,878
if you're using plastic mulch remember

91
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,479
that this is still going to require

92
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,199
weeding between beds

93
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:26,079
and removing weeds that emerge through

94
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,919
the planting holes

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,400
so even though herbicides aren't

96
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,719
available for use in hemp directly

97
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,120
they're likely to be used in crops that

98
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,120
are planted before him

99
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,200
and we have to pay attention to this

100
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,200
because these products have rotation

101
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:45,119
restrictions on the label

102
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:48,318
and hemp may not be explicitly listed

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,799
but the term other crop often is

104
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,759
and hemp is going to fall into that

105
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,040
other crop

106
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,959
category so if you're interested in

107
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,079
understanding the type of plant back

108
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,519
restrictions that

109
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,680
might be encountered in industrial hemp

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,000
production i suggest doing a google

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,719
search for the terms wisconsin

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,400
hemp and rotation restrictions and

113
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,560
you're really likely to find

114
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
this nice handout that was produced by

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,798
uw madison

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,079
which explicitly looks at the

117
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,478
restrictions

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,918
that are associated with the herbicides

119
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,439
that are used in

120
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,439
pre-seeding crops

121
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,759
these are some of the rotation

122
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,400
restrictions that my colleagues at uw

123
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,800
madison

124
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,560
found across multiple herbicide labels

125
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,280
and you can see they're extremely

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,040
varied in the amount of time that you

127
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,719
need to wait before you can plant

128
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,199
industrial hemp

129
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,960
for example for the fuselage and select

130
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,040
max labels there was a one-month

131
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,519
rotation restriction

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,319
for something like pursuit in the zether

133
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,399
pair

134
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,759
there was a 40-month rotation

135
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,719
restriction

136
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,840
now understand the list is not inclusive

137
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,520
and labels can

138
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,918
and do change and it is your

139
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,799
responsibility to always consult the

140
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,359
labels

141
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,280
before making any herbicide application

142
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,759
and before planting crops

143
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:13,839
following herbicide applications

144
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,840
just because we don't have herbicides

145
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,839
currently labeled for use in hemp

146
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,758
doesn't mean that we aren't looking to

147
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,399
see how herbicides

148
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,840
affect him we have a lot of herbicide

149
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,159
trials that are currently

150
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,000
underway in the united states and

151
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,560
they're being undertaken

152
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,800
for multiple reasons the first of which

153
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,079
is to identify active ingredients that

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
will be safe to use

155
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,839
in hemp and to address pest management

156
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,319
needs in the u.s hemp

157
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,239
industry the second reason is to

158
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,879
identify herbicides that will be able to

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,840
control

160
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,879
hemp escapes that occur in following

161
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,359
crops

162
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,159
and the third reason is to characterize

163
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,639
herbicide

164
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,759
symptomology in the case of herbicide

165
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,879
carryover or

166
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,879
drift injury

167
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,240
while there's considerable interest in

168
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:04,800
conducting hemp herbicide trials

169
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,960
very few have actually made it to formal

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,960
publications stage yet

171
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,038
the one exception being some work that's

172
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,879
been recently undertaken by michael

173
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,680
flesner's group

174
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,159
at virginia tech university and this is

175
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,840
a really good paper where they evaluated

176
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,800
herbicide tolerance of

177
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,679
industrial hemp in both greenhouse and

178
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,680
field conditions

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,759
so the objective of the research that

180
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,560
was conducted in michael flesner's lab

181
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,879
was to test

182
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,879
hep tolerance to both pre-emergence and

183
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,879
post-emergent herbicides

184
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,120
and when we say pre-emergent herbicides

185
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,439
we're talking soil applied herbicides

186
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,959
and when we're talking post-emergence

187
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,319
we're talking fully or applied

188
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,318
herbicides

189
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,000
they did conduct this across years and

190
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,280
they did do the studies in both

191
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
greenhouse and in field trials and what

192
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,198
they saw

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,240
was variability across time and

194
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,478
between growing conditions

195
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,038
although with respect to the results

196
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,199
they did find that esmetolochlor

197
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,598
was the least injurious of the soil

198
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,759
applied herbicides in the field

199
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,918
although their greenhouse trials did

200
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,720
suggest that other active ingredients

201
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,719
may have potential for future research

202
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,840
with respect to the foliar applied

203
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,800
herbicides

204
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,560
quizalifop and cythoxidim which are both

205
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,639
grass herbicides

206
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,839
were found to be the least injurious of

207
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,598
the post products

208
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:33,119
along with clopirolid and bromoxinil

209
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,959
i'd like you to know that we're also

210
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,759
conducting herbicide trials

211
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,560
here at cornell agritech these are the

212
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,960
results from

213
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,800
a preliminary screening project that

214
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,038
we've started to look at the

215
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,759
safety of post-emergence or foliar

216
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,399
applied herbicides on industrial hemp

217
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,560
and you can see that our results largely

218
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,038
agree with those that were

219
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,360
achieved by michael flechner's group

220
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,318
primarily if we're looking at percent

221
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,720
injury

222
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,199
the post-emergence herbicides currently

223
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,440
in our trial providing the least amount

224
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,120
of

225
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,240
injury to hemp are clethodyn which is a

226
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:13,120
wssa1 herbicide

227
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:16,079
clopyramid and bromoxinil

228
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,240
so we plan to continue these herbicide

229
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,000
screens both in the greenhouse and under

230
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,199
field conditions this fall

231
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,839
and in 2021 the previous slide

232
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,720
showed you our post-emergence herbicides

233
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,719
that we're looking at

234
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,879
we also have a suite of pre-emergence

235
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,719
herbicides that we'll be evaluating

236
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,680
and again we'll be doing it in both the

237
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,599
greenhouse and field conditions

238
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,079
we hope to have some trials describing

239
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,440
the impacts of herbicide carry over and

240
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,560
drift on crop

241
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,680
growth and yield development

242
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,919
we're also hoping to look at the biology

243
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,239
of

244
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,559
hemp and evaluate its competitiveness

245
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,278
with both current weed issues such as

246
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,479
velvetly

247
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,639
foxtail bindweed and nightshade and up

248
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,560
and coming problems in new york such as

249
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,559
palmer amaranth and waterhemp

250
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,278
