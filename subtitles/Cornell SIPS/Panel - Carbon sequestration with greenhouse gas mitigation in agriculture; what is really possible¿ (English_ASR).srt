1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,399
university

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,519
so welcome everybody uh we have a really

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,080
exciting panel discussion today on the

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,240
topic

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:19,118
of gsg emissions from agriculture as it

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,839
pertains also to carbon sequestration

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,640
try to bound this uh this topic a little

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,239
bit by

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,719
the consideration of what's really

11
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,439
possible and

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,879
essentially looking back in

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,520
retrospective mode

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,000
to see sort of what's changed over the

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,680
last

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,759
decade uh what we've learned and

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,920
uh having some critical thoughts about

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:45,039
how we how we move forward

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,559
so um you know we have a really

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,879
fantastic panel here today and cornell

21
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,759
has the advantage of having global

22
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:56,960
expertise and global carbon cycling

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:01:00,479
atmospheric dynamics

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,198
all the way down to soil scientists who

25
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,279
work

26
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,840
both at the fundamental level but also

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,079
on agronomic management options

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,118
and we have the good fortune of having

29
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,519
four of our

30
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,400
really global leaders in this area join

31
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,359
us today for

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,920
the panel uh we have natalie montwald

33
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,159
who's the

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,519
irving border church professor in rich

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,080
and atmospheric sciences

36
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,840
we have peter woodbury who is a senior

37
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,438
research associate in soil and crop

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,960
sciences within sips

39
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,879
we have dominic wolfe who's also a

40
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,798
senior research associate

41
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,719
uh in the soil and crop sciences and

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,920
sips and we have johannes lehmann who's

43
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,118
the liberty high baylor

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,799
bailey professor also in soil crop

45
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,118
sciences so

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,240
we have a really fantastic panel uh

47
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,519
today

48
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,679
um i should say that this is

49
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,959
really timely to have this you know you

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,040
can't

51
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,959
you can't go 30 seconds if you're paying

52
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
attention to

53
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,078
the the scientific media mass media on

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,719
these things without

55
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,158
a mention of regenerative agriculture or

56
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,118
the potential role for

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,799
agriculture to reduce net ghg emissions

58
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,640
but there's a lot of a contention around

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,959
how we get there

60
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,239
and the the panel today is meant to to

61
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,759
point us in that direction

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,920
the way it will go is that we're gonna

63
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,560
have uh four lightning talks in the

64
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,639
order that i

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,598
introduced the speakers then we're gonna

66
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,679
pivot to

67
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,039
a panel discussion that will take us to

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,400
about 120

69
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:27,120
and and then the final 10 minutes or so

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,439
will be open questions from the audience

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
so

72
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,239
please keep those uh keep those in your

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,959
pocket type them in the chat if you have

74
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,039
to go

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,878
and we'll pivot to them at the end of

76
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,079
the session today

77
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,959
uh so with no further ado i think that

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,519
dominic you're

79
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,640
in the lead on transitioning between

80
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,319
slides

81
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,079
and everyone else please make sure that

82
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,399
your mics are muted

83
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,519
and away we go thank you to the panel

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,519
for applying this together

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,560
well thank you ender for moderating i

86
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,158
think i'm up next here since my slide is

87
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,120
on here and uh

88
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,639
um what i want to emphasize um you know

89
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,158
i'm not a soil scientist

90
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,839
what i want to emphasize is really what

91
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:08,878
do we need to do to meet the low carbon

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,200
targets

93
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,039
so i'm natalie mahowald i'm not going to

94
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,799
talk about my own personal work

95
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,158
with earth system science or climate

96
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,120
models i'm really just going to

97
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,439
present the ipcc intergovernmental panel

98
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,640
on climate change

99
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,318
results here and the context for soil

100
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,000
sequestration

101
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,919
what do we need to do to meet the low

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,400
carbon targets

103
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,079
one really important point that i find

104
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,719
that a lot of people don't really

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,480
understand

106
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,080
is climate change has really long time

107
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,439
skills and that's really what we're

108
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,200
trying to get after

109
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,598
so um on this slide this is a classic

110
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,719
climate change kind of slide where we

111
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,759
start you know the

112
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,318
x-axis is 1850 out to 2100 here in the

113
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,798
middle or

114
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,719
2300 to the right so this is the kind of

115
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,400
view i have of the world these really

116
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,400
long time scales

117
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,680
um on the y-axis that's the temperature

118
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,239
change and you can see in octo 2005 for

119
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,840
this particular plot from the last ipcc

120
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,920
assessment report

121
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,080
that's the historical time series and

122
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,000
right now we're at a crossroads where

123
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,680
we can go on the red trajectory which

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,160
would be business as usual

125
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,160
which you know 2100 might be 4 degrees c

126
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,280
2308 degrees or more c

127
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,720
versus if we act right now and we

128
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,959
completely change

129
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
our economy and start sequestering

130
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,079
carbon as much as possible that's this

131
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,040
lowest blue line

132
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,000
um so really we're acting now to have an

133
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,040
impact

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,120
at 2100 or later so it's a really

135
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,960
difficult problem for politicians to get

136
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,399
their head around but also for humans to

137
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,239
get their head around but

138
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,599
it's really important to understand

139
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,639
climate change has a really

140
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,639
long time scale next slide

141
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,478
the the other point to make is that it

142
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
is

143
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,800
the cumulative co2 emissions which is on

144
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,879
the x-axis here

145
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,560
um that linearly relates to the

146
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,879
temperature anomaly relative

147
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,759
uh to pre-industrial and there's a

148
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,639
little bit of

149
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,879
noise up and down in this you can see um

150
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,720
you know from short-lived gases like

151
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,959
methane or aerosols or

152
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,520
exactly the trajectory but almost all

153
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,198
this is co2 emissions are dominating now

154
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,879
nitrous oxide emissions also have a

155
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,639
really long lifetime so

156
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,959
they could also be included here but are

157
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,560
much much smaller in magnitude

158
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,719
but the reason we only think about the

159
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,439
cumulative co2 is because of the

160
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,880
really long lifetime of co2 which is

161
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,000
thousands of years

162
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,519
and how much co2 we emit okay and the

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,478
really important thing to understand

164
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,719
is that until our anthropogenic net

165
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,839
anthropogenic co2 emissions go to zero

166
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,199
we will continue to have climate change

167
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,279
under the paris agreement we're going

168
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,038
for three or three and a half degrees

169
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,918
yeah um who's going to cause most of our

170
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,478
climate change

171
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,439
um it's developing countries if they use

172
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:59,680
our pathway

173
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,478
i mean that's how we got here to our

174
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,079
wealth

175
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,120
um and our uh lifestyle is by emitting a

176
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,120
lot of co2

177
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,478
and developing countries of course want

178
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,478
to have our lifestyle

179
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,159
why wouldn't they and they want to have

180
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,038
our long lifetimes with really good

181
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
health care well

182
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,399
okay maybe we don't have that but we

183
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,960
have better health care

184
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,799
um and an incredible thing is is

185
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,959
happening right now or what's before

186
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
covet is we might actually be able to

187
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,000
eradicate

188
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,680
extreme poverty by 2030 and we have the

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,160
sustainable development goals

190
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,840
and you can see this in this slide again

191
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,520
going from 1820 to 2015 that the number

192
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,359
of people in extreme poverty has

193
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,719
actually gone down over the last 30

194
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,639
years so this is

195
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,639
incredible this would be great if this

196
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,079
happened but the bad part is is right

197
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,038
now they're following our development

198
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,639
pathway

199
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,560
which is the cheap way to do it which

200
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,879
has emitted a lot of co2

201
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,560
so this is the real dilemma it's climate

202
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,478
change versus development for

203
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,800
a lot of the people on this planet and

204
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:00,399
that makes it really really hard

205
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,560
next slide so what do we need to do

206
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,719
to meet the low climate carbon targets

207
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,680
given that developing countries want to

208
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,120
develop

209
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,959
well here again is one of these long

210
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,680
time series plots but but what we have

211
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,879
to do

212
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
on the y-axis here is our co2 emissions

213
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,839
per year

214
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,680
we have to stop emitting from fossil

215
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,439
fuel sources here

216
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,598
and turn our economy around so that

217
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,800
we're not using so much co2

218
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,879
not using fossil fuels using renewables

219
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,079
and we can switch to low-carbon energy

220
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,839
sources right away

221
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,279
and i think the developed countries need

222
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,279
to lead on this

223
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,038
with solar and wind and developing the

224
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,038
battery technology

225
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,519
we also need to cut the cut energy

226
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:42,000
demand we need to change our behavior to

227
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,598
reach any of these low carbon targets

228
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,279
and we need to develop new technologies

229
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,680
there's quite a bit of co2

230
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,519
emissions that we don't have substitutes

231
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,720
for we solar and wind aren't substitutes

232
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,399
for them

233
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,840
but really importantly that i think a

234
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,519
lot of people don't understand is

235
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,878
because the developing countries are

236
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,159
developing right now

237
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,599
and because uh the co2 emissions are

238
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,479
are so difficult to substitute for some

239
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,399
things

240
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,399
we have to develop carbon dioxide

241
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,598
removal techniques and i think that

242
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,439
the recent ipcc reports have made this

243
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,680
so abundantly clear

244
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,120
and the technologically easiest of the

245
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,240
land-based natural methods that we're

246
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,319
going to talk about today

247
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,439
and and how how good are they and how

248
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,879
useful are they

249
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,120
but we're probably also going to need

250
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,800
tecla technological methods but

251
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,478
the really important thing to understand

252
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
is that carbon dioxide removal

253
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,240
is going to be necessary for any of our

254
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,639
carbon targets

255
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,639
thank you

256
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,599
hi i'm peter woodbury i'm gonna i have

257
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,559
the next section

258
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,519
of the of our short presentations here

259
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,518
next slide please

260
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,399
so today we're talking about carbon

261
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,600
sequestration in

262
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,000
agriculture focusing mostly on soil

263
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,320
carbon

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,440
sequestration but i want to flip the

265
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,399
script for a moment

266
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,320
and say as many of you know if you've

267
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,639
been involved with agriculture there are

268
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,320
many reasons to add organic matter or

269
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,838
carbon to soil

270
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,160
in fact greenhouse gas mitigation

271
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,680
may not be anywhere near the top of most

272
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:17,919
people's lists for the reasons to do so

273
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,919
so we're talking about improving soil

274
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:23,679
health or soil quality

275
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:27,439
reducing erosion reducing compaction

276
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:30,479
improving the infiltration of the soil

277
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,279
for for water improving drainage

278
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,560
and increasing water holding capacity

279
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:37,278
these are among many

280
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,799
many functions that can improve with

281
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:43,679
improved soil health

282
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,679
due to in additions of organic matter

283
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,319
another important thing is maintaining

284
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,439
or increasing

285
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,560
crop yields and that's important

286
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,320
obviously for many reasons but in the

287
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,799
in the climate change context it's

288
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,560
important because of leakage

289
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:05,838
so the idea being

290
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,838
if we can have increased

291
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,000
sustainable intensification and

292
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,200
increased crop production on the lands

293
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,720
that we have

294
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,720
through both yield increases and

295
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,240
through intensification of cropping

296
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
cycles so having

297
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,079
having crops on the land more of the

298
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,199
time

299
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,000
we reduce the pressure globally and

300
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,360
regionally

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,559
to cut down forests to to have new crop

302
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,839
land available

303
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,879
so that's that's the connection here

304
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,600
between

305
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:42,958
uh crop yield and and production

306
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,399
and greenhouse gas mitigation

307
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,278
and then of course we're here today to

308
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,879
talk about sequestering carbon

309
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,439
and we're going to talk about how that's

310
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,838
temporary that if you can add carbon to

311
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,839
the soil it can also be lost again

312
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,920
and as we just heard we have a very

313
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,399
long-term problem in climate change so

314
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,479
we need

315
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,759
long-term solutions if we're putting

316
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,639
carbon in the soil

317
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,958
we need it to stay there next slide

318
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,958
please

319
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,120
this is just an example of

320
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,959
another way to think about this leakage

321
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,159
idea

322
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:22,078
and this is showing that as grass yield

323
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:27,439
increases the greenhouse gas emissions

324
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:30,958
per unit of of yield per ton of grass

325
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,519
production decreases this wouldn't be a

326
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,439
decrease

327
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,679
on the area of crop land so any

328
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,959
greenhouse gas benefit of this would

329
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,838
have to be this idea of avoiding leakage

330
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,838
next slide please

331
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:52,239
so one topic that's discussed frequently

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,600
in terms of agricultural

333
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,839
soil carbon is reducing tillage

334
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,320
and this is indeed possible to reduce or

335
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,839
eliminate tillage in many systems

336
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,639
the issue is that the soil carbon that's

337
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,399
added can

338
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,919
easily be lost again if tillage

339
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,839
increases

340
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,838
next slide

341
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,639
there's also a lot of discussion of of

342
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,759
cover cropping in

343
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,440
in the u.s and some other places but i'd

344
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,519
like to focus instead on

345
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,639
on double cropping so again this is the

346
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,679
idea of sustainable intensification

347
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,799
by increasing the the number of crops in

348
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,719
a cropping cycle

349
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,159
so in new york state that might mean

350
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,200
adding a

351
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,679
a winter a double crop

352
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,920
over the winter to what's normally a

353
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,078
single crop system

354
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,958
and again we get these same benefits of

355
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:49,919
adding organic matter to soil

356
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:53,838
we also might be able to to scavenge and

357
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,838
reduce some nutrient loss

358
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and again we can increase soil carbon

359
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,958
next slide please

360
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,720
so much as i love soil i also love trees

361
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,799
and i want to mention them because

362
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,959
storing soil carbon is not only

363
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,439
temporary it's also hard to measure

364
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,759
and verify so if we want to know whether

365
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,360
a benefit's occurring

366
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,000
it's quite challenging trees are easier

367
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,120
to

368
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,078
see they can be visually assessed

369
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,919
and you can assess the amount of carbon

370
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,120
with a limited number of measurements of

371
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,439
the trees

372
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,720
and and calculate calculating the amount

373
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,720
of carbon sequestration

374
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,800
so another possibility for carbon

375
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,800
sequestration in agriculture in addition

376
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,559
to soils is adding trees

377
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,639
one way or another to agricultural

378
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,399
systems this is an example

379
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,639
in new york state of a silver pasture

380
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,639
so it's grazing livestock but also

381
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,519
produce growing fence posts

382
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,079
to keep the livestock contained and

383
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,639
growing

384
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,838
black walnuts as a longer term crop so

385
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,120
it's a

386
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:08,959
cropping system that has livestock

387
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,120
tree production grazing

388
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,439
and also is sequestering carbon in the

389
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,159
trees there are many other ways to add

390
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
trees to

391
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,360
agricultural landscapes and many of

392
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,440
these

393
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,759
have multiple benefits in addition to

394
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,560
carbon sequestration

395
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,559
next slide please

396
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,958
so this is my final slide for for my

397
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,639
section

398
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:38,000
and this is from a paper on

399
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,320
on natural climate solutions

400
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,839
globally and it's just a selection of

401
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,079
some of the pathways from this

402
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,000
publication

403
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,439
you're going to hear more about biochar

404
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,759
today

405
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,920
conservation agriculture is what is

406
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,519
roughly speaking also regenerative

407
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,559
agriculture so these would be

408
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,679
practices such as as

409
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:05,119
cover cropping and reduced tillage

410
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:07,519
and there are two bars here one for

411
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,639
peatland restoration and one for avoided

412
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,679
peatland impa

413
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,399
impacts and of course this is

414
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,278
for the very high carbon soils that have

415
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,600
the potential

416
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,958
to lose a great deal of carbon on an

417
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,879
area basis

418
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,879
so they deserve special attention

419
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,479
and trees in cropland this was just a

420
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,440
limited

421
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,440
choice of growing alleys of trees among

422
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:38,560
among crop fields so there's additional

423
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:40,799
opportunities that are not shown here

424
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,879
the largest bars are avoided forest

425
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,599
conversion and reforestation

426
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,519
and why am i showing those when our

427
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,879
topic is agriculture

428
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,320
the reason is because the only way that

429
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,519
these

430
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,759
can be implemented is by increasing

431
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,399
agricultural production on current

432
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,039
agricultural lands so this is taking

433
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,600
low quality land out of grazing a small

434
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,679
fraction about four percent globally

435
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,278
and replanting it in trees that's the

436
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,799
reforestation

437
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,320
that requires that we produce the

438
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,719
livestock more efficiently

439
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,240
on a smaller amount of land so

440
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,360
agriculture

441
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,639
improved production

442
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,039
is the way that we can achieve both of

443
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,919
these

444
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,919
forest pathways thanks very much

445
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,600
okay thank you peter um so yeah

446
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,000
um i'm also going to talk a little bit

447
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,920
about soil carbon sequestration

448
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,399
um like so if peter's mentioned that

449
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,159
there are

450
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,759
many reasons apart from climate change

451
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:44,799
why we might want to do it it provides a

452
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,120
lot of benefits

453
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,240
but i'm going to focus on in this little

454
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,879
talk about

455
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,560
its climate impacts and i think natalie

456
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,480
set it up nicely with um

457
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,479
the point about the fact that we really

458
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,519
need to think in terms of long-term

459
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,240
temperature changes

460
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,519
depend on your overall carbon budget so

461
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,959
it's your

462
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,279
it's the net amount of co2

463
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,120
emitted or removed from the atmosphere

464
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:14,078
that will determine your long-term

465
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:16,239
uh temperature rise so with that in mind

466
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,359
how much can we actually store in soils

467
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,599
i mean there's

468
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,879
it's hard to sort of open a newspaper or

469
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,480
anything these days without seeing

470
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,679
someone talking about how massive the

471
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,160
potential is

472
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,519
uh here's one uh modeling study i could

473
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,880
have used others i use this one because

474
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,960
it's a recent

475
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,000
study myself johannes and some other

476
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,319
collaborators have

477
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,519
just produced which will be available on

478
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,038
our website soon

479
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:42,480
so we took the ipcc model um and

480
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:44,480
ran it globally to see if we

481
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,160
on cropland for example on every piece

482
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,558
of cropland in the world

483
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,400
if we did all we could do in terms of

484
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,319
increasing organic matter inputs and in

485
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,200
terms of reducing soil disturbance and

486
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,678
no-till

487
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,679
i kind of thing on grasslands if we

488
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,720
managed all of our grasslands so that we

489
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,840
brought them up to

490
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,200
native grassland quality um with a lot

491
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,558
of carbon stored in them

492
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,120
so there's a lot of degraded crust

493
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,399
glands where that could be reversed

494
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,798
the third panel that we're called

495
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,038
rewilding is if what would

496
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,038
just as a thought exercise in a sense to

497
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:18,240
see what is the ultimate potential

498
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:20,319
if we removed all humans from the planet

499
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,640
and allowed all of our agricultural

500
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:25,200
lands to go back to their native

501
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,320
natural condition how much carbon would

502
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,558
that store

503
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,079
and the bottom side i'm probably not

504
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,200
spent too much time concentrating on it

505
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,879
just to be aware that

506
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,480
of course it can go the other direction

507
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,400
if we continue to degrade our

508
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,360
agricultural lands as we have been

509
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,240
we could lose up to over 100 petagrams

510
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,959
of carbon

511
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,400
that's more now a pentagram of carbon

512
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,600
say was a billion tons i mean these

513
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,559
sound like massive numbers and they're

514
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,719
driving a lot of

515
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,399
interest potentially this these are the

516
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,079
projections to 30 centimeters

517
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,759
if you look at the whole sole depth down

518
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,879
to two meters it could be maybe three

519
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,798
times that

520
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,080
um but these are these give you a sense

521
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:59,599
of just what scale

522
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,240
we could do in terms of drawing down

523
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:05,279
carbon is that a lot though

524
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,000
well we have to reflect on just how

525
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,440
large

526
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,359
the climate change problem is that we're

527
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,720
dealing we really have an emissions

528
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,839
problem that we need to tackle at the

529
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,839
moment with

530
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,359
its average emissions over the last

531
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:18,399
decade have been close to

532
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:22,159
11 uh petrograms of carbon

533
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,640
as co2 a year so

534
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,000
if we stored as much carbon as we could

535
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,160
in the world's croplands

536
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,359
that would avoid roughly 16 months of

537
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,440
current emissions

538
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,959
and that's only co2 that's not even our

539
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,798
other greenhouse gas emissions

540
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:40,079
or in grasslands 14 months of co2

541
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,000
removing all humans from the

542
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,279
planet is maybe three and a half three

543
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,119
and a third years

544
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,599
if we talk about uh the full depth of

545
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,839
profile maybe a decade of emissions

546
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,319
that we could be stored i think these um

547
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:55,839
numbers are quite

548
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,960
um they give us pause to actually

549
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,439
reflect on

550
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,558
the fact that we need to focus on

551
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,679
emissions with

552
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,119
most urgency because any delay in

553
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,840
reducing emissions can

554
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,359
quickly within a matter of months out do

555
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,759
anything that we could achieve over a

556
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:14,240
century in terms of ambitious

557
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,599
programs of soil carbon sequestration in

558
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,558
agriculture

559
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,519
so reducing emissions is absolutely

560
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,759
imperative

561
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,759
and this is if you like icing on the

562
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,119
cake as natalie mentioned we need to

563
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,440
draw down

564
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,599
we aren't going to get to a stable um

565
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,679
habitable climate without

566
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,759
also removing missions but we really

567
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,240
need to be

568
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,599
cognizant of just what soul carbon

569
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,000
sequestration could achieve in that

570
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,000
regard

571
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,319
so i'd also like to make the point that

572
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
soil carbon sinks are actually quite a

573
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,759
risky place to put in

574
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
carbon peter mentioned this as well

575
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,119
anything that you put into the soils

576
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,519
if you return to business as usual

577
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,798
practices can be lost again

578
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,599
um and in fact it's not simply that

579
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,158
there's a risk

580
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,839
of return to business as usual but the

581
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,960
more soil organic carbon you put in the

582
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,319
soils

583
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,000
if you put it there is solar organic

584
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,038
matter that soil organic matter also

585
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
contains

586
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,640
other nutrients notably phosphorus and

587
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,679
nitrogen but

588
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,159
others as well which historically

589
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,840
farmers have accessed these nutrients by

590
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,720
tilling their solar organic matter and

591
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,798
turning it into

592
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,558
plant food and the more you build up

593
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,158
again in fact the more you increase the

594
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:25,440
incentives to actually reverse some of

595
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,600
these gains that you had so

596
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,519
it's not only risky because we might

597
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,439
stop but it's risky because people may

598
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:35,119
actually want to stop

599
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,360
um it's also risky because it's um

600
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,279
these incentives to reverse could i

601
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,038
actually play out in a farmer's

602
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,558
favor if they decided to reverse any

603
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,440
gains and they get paid again just

604
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,200
quite carbon in the same land also it's

605
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,440
risky in the sense that

606
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,960
there will be huge incentives to do

607
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,320
things like moving carbon from one place

608
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,840
to another so for example if you're

609
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:54,720
getting paid carbon credits with soy

610
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,199
carbon

611
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,880
you only put into your into that carbon

612
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
scheme the land that is storing it but

613
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,039
you

614
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,558
build soil carbon that place by moving

615
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,319
your crop residues your minerals and

616
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:05,839
something else from other places

617
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,918
you get paid to store carbon you've

618
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,399
actually relocated and you haven't

619
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,440
actually

620
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,720
put anything new into the system

621
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,320
just the third thing i'd like to

622
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,240
highlight in terms of things we need to

623
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,678
be careful about with solar organic

624
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,038
carbon as a sink

625
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,440
is that it's really just not a very

626
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:26,480
efficient way of using biomass

627
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,440
um so in terms of if you add

628
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,720
a ton of uh carbon in the form of

629
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,200
biomass into your soils

630
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,720
after a hundred years around a percent

631
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,640
of that might be left it depends

632
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,038
depending on your climate and

633
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,038
the quality of that of the biomass

634
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:43,200
itself how long the exact percentage

635
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,798
but it's a very small fraction of that

636
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,480
carbon bromine most of it will be

637
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,359
respired by microbes over the course of

638
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,159
that century

639
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,639
and and even more into the future

640
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,159
whereas if

641
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,480
we took the same biomass converted to

642
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,960
biochar about 40

643
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,720
of that carbon would remain after 100

644
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,558
years in the biochar plus we can get

645
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,400
other benefits from things like avoiding

646
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,879
nitrous oxide emissions from soils

647
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,679
and producing co-producing energy with

648
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,880
at the same time

649
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,679
surface fossil fuels if we only burn

650
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,520
that

651
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,120
biomass to make bioenergy we could

652
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,960
offset a lot of fossil fuels we don't

653
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,519
get any carbon storage but the

654
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,319
mitigation potential is still very much

655
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:23,599
larger than adding that by mass to soils

656
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:23,918
and it's expensive to do but in terms of

657
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,240
the

658
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,600
most efficient way we know of really to

659
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,319
use that biomass at the moment

660
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,918
is if we uh both store most of that

661
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,279
carbon by pumping underground in the

662
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,360
form of co2

663
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,639
and release energy while converting it

664
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,199
to co2 which can also

665
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,360
um fossil fuels we can get a very much

666
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,960
more efficient use of that same biomass

667
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,158
so it's economists

668
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,159
often think in terms of something they

669
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,880
call an opportunity cost

670
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,960
so if we if we want to say that building

671
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,000
solar cardiac carbon is a net gain for

672
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,159
the

673
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,200
climate that really depends on what we

674
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,440
see as being the

675
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,558
alternative the best alternative and the

676
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,840
best alternative if we're just

677
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,839
squandering that carbon rather than

678
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,278
solar carbon yes of course it's again

679
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,558
but if we look at it relative to the

680
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,159
other ways you might use that carbon

681
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:08,798
more efficiently in fact it's a

682
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,720
detriment

683
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,319
it's a loss to a climate mitigation

684
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,679
because you've squandered away the

685
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,960
opportunity to do very much

686
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,480
more with that same carbon uh finally

687
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,000
just one last slide i want to finish on

688
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,720
a more positive note

689
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,079
is that soil carbon is not just saw

690
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,079
organic carbon

691
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,519
so biochar obviously very much more

692
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,319
stable although

693
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,400
it's expensive to make um so we needed

694
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,960
carbon price to actually drive that

695
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,120
but because it's much more stable we can

696
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,240
build up stocks very much

697
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,519
more quickly and we can

698
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,599
we know that they will be there for very

699
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,359
much longer and

700
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,558
another on the right hand side enhanced

701
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,240
weathering so if we're looking at the

702
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,480
inorganic carbon cycle

703
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,759
adding basic rocks uh ground up to

704
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,919
agricultural soils

705
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,200
they react with carbon dioxide dissolved

706
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,759
in groundwater

707
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,440
to uh in the weathering reaction to

708
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:00,079
produce carbonates and bicarbonates

709
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,558
which then

710
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,278
store the carbon in in inorganic for

711
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,599
form

712
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,200
and there is a very large global

713
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,278
potential to do those

714
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,240
storing that carbon safely away long

715
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,079
term and

716
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,839
combating ocean acidification at the

717
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:19,278
same time

718
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:22,480
thank you i'll pass over to johannes now

719
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:25,440
thank you dominic um yeah

720
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,360
thanks for organizing uh andy and and

721
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,919
natalie for steering us into this and

722
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,399
setting us up

723
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,200
i would like to give you some messages

724
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,679
first

725
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,720
dominic if you give me the next slide um

726
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,080
just some some random maybe seemingly

727
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,360
random sound bites

728
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,399
um that i want to close this this first

729
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,278
round robin

730
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,159
uh one is that there's a big difference

731
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,640
between

732
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,320
the actual removal so the carbon that's

733
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
sequestered and greenhouse gas emission

734
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,119
reductions and

735
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,480
and there might be trade-offs um and

736
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,719
i'll show you some some

737
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,679
slides about that and of course there's

738
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,960
food production

739
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,360
also as as peter so correctly mentioned

740
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,200
um

741
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:08,798
and that might be what the farmer is all

742
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,519
after uh whereas

743
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,679
maybe society and policy making is is

744
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,440
after the others as well

745
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,120
and there might be trade-offs equally

746
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,640
but also some synergies

747
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:23,199
but not always synergies uh there's

748
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,880
a really a large controversy around

749
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,240
achievable targets and you might have

750
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,640
heard about the 4 per ml initiative

751
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,519
it's really important and that starts to

752
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,679
be

753
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,720
more of the vernacular on the street so

754
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,159
to speak

755
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,558
that these goals being more aspirational

756
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,039
and inspirational that than actually

757
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,720
uh goals that that can be achieved at

758
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:48,000
any place

759
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,798
and the focus shifting more from

760
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,278
from the actual carbon accrual to soil

761
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,839
health benefits

762
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,400
when looking at at the organic carbon

763
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,319
it's really

764
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,080
not about locked away but the

765
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,839
persistence is a as a result of

766
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,079
functional complexity that is

767
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,918
needed and that needs constant care

768
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,519
rather than a one-time sequestration

769
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,960
there's spatial

770
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,558
questions that that are still ignored

771
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,480
and i'll show you something and

772
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,558
dominic just mentioned inorganic carbon

773
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,400
sequestration um and i show you no

774
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,240
slides about that because there is not

775
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,480
very much to be shown about it and

776
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,359
but that we really need to figure this

777
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,558
out as well and

778
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:27,119
and and uh and fold it into this

779
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,759
this discussion so now here here's why i

780
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,959
tell you this

781
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:33,679
um in the next slide uh

782
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,480
so the the the four per ml uh paris

783
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,798
accord

784
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,038
was really a political move and has has

785
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,278
made a world of difference

786
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,079
you might be very very critical and you

787
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,200
should be

788
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:48,398
um and there was a storm storm of

789
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,880
of a publication flurry at some point

790
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:51,678
that has died down luckily a little bit

791
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,039
um

792
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,720
uh but uh it it was a world of

793
00:27:55,038 --> 00:28:00,079
difference for somebody like me who

794
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,720
went to the un conventions and political

795
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,240
meetings

796
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,079
um for now 15 years or so

797
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,079
or if you talked about soil carbon in

798
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,038
the 2000s everybody would laugh you out

799
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,599
of the room

800
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,960
and now soul carbon even natalie talks

801
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,439
about soil organic carbon

802
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,960
right so so even atmospheric scientists

803
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
are talking about soil organic carbon

804
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,519
now

805
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,120
um which is really a massive change from

806
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,200
10 15 years ago

807
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,239
the 4 per ml is really just a

808
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,720
calculation

809
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,599
of thinking through what is the net

810
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,960
emissions

811
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:34,959
between what we have in an emissions

812
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,480
um from fossil fuel uh emissions versus

813
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,240
the uh uptake in oceans and land and

814
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,599
and the missing one to balance the

815
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,640
budget at the time

816
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,158
uh was about equating two four per ml of

817
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,679
soil carbon stock so that's that's

818
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,960
really all there was no

819
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:54,240
further thinking um and uh and and

820
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:57,519
but i think that there's no it

821
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,440
it started uh accelerating a discussion

822
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,038
that puts more fine points on what's

823
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,159
actually achievable

824
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:07,679
the next slide um the

825
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,159
the the concept of uh why do we have

826
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,880
organic carbon in soil has fundamentally

827
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,799
changed what

828
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,039
it looks like uh has fundamentally

829
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:18,639
changed over the last decade or so

830
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:21,119
um from recalcitrance uh at that point

831
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,840
of so-called humic substances and humus

832
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,199
uh to

833
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:28,240
a much more nuanced understanding

834
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,519
of decomposition and mineralization

835
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,120
phenomena in the soil the

836
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:37,359
the importance of mineral stabilization

837
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,079
and aggregate stabilization of organic

838
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,278
carbon

839
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:44,319
and more uh the importance of

840
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:47,599
what's called functional complexity

841
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:48,398
of the pore structures the temporal

842
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:50,798
dynamics

843
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:51,519
and the diversity of organic matter in

844
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:53,918
soil

845
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,720
which all relates and says that we need

846
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,559
to

847
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,000
think about this as an ecosystem the

848
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,798
soil um and

849
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,398
we we to achieve greater persistence we

850
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:03,519
really need to manage that entire

851
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,000
ecosystem

852
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,158
uh and that that doesn't mean we can put

853
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,319
something in and forget about it um

854
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,640
it's really that that constant care

855
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,240
versus one-time sequestration that

856
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,880
that's that's how we need to think about

857
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,159
soil carbon

858
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,520
think about soil carbon and the the

859
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,720
dichotomy

860
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,679
or synergy of greenhouse gas emission

861
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,278
reductions and

862
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,240
and uh green and soil carbon accrual and

863
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,519
actual cdr uh carbon dioxide removal

864
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,919
from the atmosphere

865
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,798
here illustrated with biochar systems

866
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,880
that

867
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:39,839
have multiple moving parts as you can

868
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,559
see

869
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,558
introducing pyrolysis in biochar into an

870
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:48,558
agro ecosystem means that we can

871
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:51,759
offset fossil fuels due to

872
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:55,200
biomass fuels uh that

873
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:58,000
reduces fossil fuel emissions the

874
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,798
um transformation of an easily

875
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,398
decomposing

876
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:05,759
material into something that's biochar

877
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:08,319
will will uh reduce emissions

878
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,519
of that material but then also the

879
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,678
biochar has

880
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,640
can have effects on carbon that's

881
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,559
already in the soil

882
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,679
other greenhouse gases methane and

883
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:20,000
nitrous oxide and

884
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:22,720
of course increase or change

885
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,599
sometimes decrease crop production and

886
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,319
lead to

887
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,839
additional or less photosynthesis so

888
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,439
there are you already see the

889
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:33,199
the the story between cdr and ghg

890
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,640
emission reductions is is not a

891
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,558
straightforward one but there are

892
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,200
systems such as biochar and the others

893
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:39,839
as well

894
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,319
where all of those play a role um and

895
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,158
are

896
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,839
potentially synergistic if we're

897
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,159
increasing soil health and increasing

898
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,639
photosynthesis or antagonistic as i will

899
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,679
show

900
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,640
in the next slides um so we can look at

901
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,919
in the next slide um the the

902
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,360
relationship between

903
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,200
systems greenhouse gas emission

904
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:00,398
interactions here on the x-axis

905
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:04,159
versus actual soil carbon accrual cdr

906
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:07,759
um on the y-axis and plot some of the

907
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,840
major and and divergent um uh or

908
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,200
very different strategies cropland

909
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,480
management is really

910
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,278
um a system where we manage inherent

911
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,440
carbon

912
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:22,720
uh such as through less tillage or

913
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,360
growing more diverse crops and

914
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,480
crop residue management and so on but

915
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,398
you're dealing with

916
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,839
with carbon that's already in the system

917
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,639
whereas biochar

918
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,639
is potentially a a lateral and most

919
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,840
often a lateral transfer

920
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,440
of carbon and input um and and

921
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,278
behaves therefore very different whereas

922
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,240
restored wetland uh

923
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:49,440
is a system where you're reducing

924
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,880
the the output more than increasing the

925
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,558
input

926
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,640
and and you see that the the

927
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,879
relationship between

928
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,200
system greenhouse gas emissions uh

929
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,760
reductions and and so a carbon accrual

930
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,399
uh look very different whereas biochar

931
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,960
has

932
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:09,359
has um uh tilts more towards a greater

933
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,399
uh greenhouse gas emission reduction at

934
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,599
about the same

935
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:16,079
carbon accrual um restored wetland is

936
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,759
is sort of on the other side um that

937
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,439
also is an interesting

938
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,278
way to look at it in the on the next

939
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,440
slide if you um

940
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:27,440
plot the uh the soil carbon accrual so

941
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,360
more carbon sequestration in soils

942
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,519
against food production

943
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,278
um and and there you see very clearly

944
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,720
you know in most restored wetlands we

945
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,839
would assume that we're displacing

946
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,679
wetlands with with agriculture

947
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:42,000
um if if it happened at all and

948
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,440
and therefore we typically see a

949
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,159
reduction in food production and a

950
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,480
negative

951
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,159
relationship whereas with cropland

952
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,720
management we probably

953
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,519
would always uh very often assume that

954
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,038
we have

955
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,960
more yield with more carbon and soil

956
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,038
although it plateaus at some point

957
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,120
but um that there might be a negative

958
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,038
relationship between those two

959
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,038
as well whereas in biochar with adding

960
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,519
carbon we're probably

961
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,440
in most cases increase although probably

962
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,079
not linearly

963
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,559
probably asymptotic increase yields and

964
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,800
and

965
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,679
and food production whereas with with

966
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,720
fertilizer we

967
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,440
we probably increase um food production

968
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,439
but

969
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,000
in many cases um not accrue more carbon

970
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,480
although

971
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,358
there's there's um interesting debates

972
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,679
about that

973
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,759
uh to close i want to make the point

974
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,679
about the spatial redistribution

975
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,720
um of of resources and carbon and

976
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,960
nutrients

977
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,239
uh and that hasn't been done really at

978
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,159
all um

979
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,519
uh we we sort of recognized that this is

980
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,679
a landscape issue

981
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,519
um that carbon is moving around the

982
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,039
landscape and can be allocated in

983
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,960
different areas especially if we're

984
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,320
talking about waste biomass

985
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,199
especially if we're talking about

986
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,480
nutrient rich here an example from pyrol

987
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,159
from poultry litter and the conversion

988
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,358
with thermochemical

989
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:05,199
techniques um the example of the state

990
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,319
of georgia in the u.s

991
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,118
where uh the phosphorus resources with

992
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,200
poultry

993
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,320
are very differently distributed in the

994
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:14,159
state than

995
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,000
the phosphorus demands and therefore the

996
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,159
biochar needs

997
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,199
and you can find different optima

998
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,440
between

999
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,598
emission reductions profit and

1000
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,358
greenhouse and and total carbon dioxide

1001
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,200
sequestration

1002
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:29,598
so you would you would plan your

1003
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,679
conversions and your collection stations

1004
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,519
across the state very very differently

1005
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,960
if you would prioritize profit

1006
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,199
versus greenhouse gas emission

1007
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,079
reductions uh versus carbon

1008
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,759
sequestration uh so those analysis have

1009
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,320
done only been incipiently

1010
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,440
and and they certainly lead both to

1011
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,960
opportunities for

1012
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,358
for trade-offs um uh and and for

1013
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,599
some synergies um but that's that's

1014
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:56,838
really at the start of it only

1015
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,720
well that was it from me thank you very

1016
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:00,719
much

1017
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,078
thank you so much johannes and peter

1018
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,159
dominic and natalie

1019
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,560
um we're going to pivot now to asking a

1020
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:07,279
couple of of questions from my side to

1021
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:08,960
the panel

1022
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,320
we'll kind of try to keep that short so

1023
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,440
that we at least have five to ten

1024
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,680
minutes for the

1025
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,079
the audience to chime in but to the

1026
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,399
panel i'd like to ask you first

1027
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,519
um what you think are some potential

1028
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,320
game changers

1029
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,679
in land use based strategies for ghg

1030
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,559
mitigation

1031
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:29,039
that could be prioritized by the donor

1032
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,320
communities private companies and also

1033
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,679
younger scientists

1034
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,680
to perspectives on that

1035
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:40,239
well this is peter out okay go ahead go

1036
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,760
ahead dominic

1037
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,039
okay i mean we've well i think we've

1038
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,119
mentioned a couple of potential game

1039
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,639
changes already the talks i won't go on

1040
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,358
again about the inorganic carbon and

1041
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:53,199
things like that but a couple of things

1042
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,799
that we could add really are one is

1043
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,239
recognizing that in green that the

1044
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,400
greenhouse gas emission profile from

1045
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,399
agriculture is

1046
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,559
not is more about nitrous oxide than it

1047
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,280
is about the carbon story

1048
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,759
and the potentials there are massive now

1049
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,240
most

1050
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,480
of that is focusing on the fact that um

1051
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:12,319
about 45 percent of nitrogen that we add

1052
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,119
to fields end up in the harvested crop

1053
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,880
and maybe we can

1054
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,480
incrementally improve that improve that

1055
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,400
united use efficiency

1056
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,838
but the real game changer in that system

1057
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,280
i think is actually looking at the food

1058
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,279
system as a whole

1059
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,119
where less than 10 probably about seven

1060
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,960
or eight percent of nitrogen that we had

1061
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,160
to fields actually ends up in food that

1062
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,519
is consumed

1063
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,000
so there are massive um opportunities

1064
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,920
there to

1065
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,838
improve the system-wide efficiencies in

1066
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,960
the food system about getting nutrient

1067
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,960
recycling

1068
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,639
avoiding emissions as its nutrients are

1069
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,519
added to salt and avoiding emissions

1070
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,480
from producing them and the second game

1071
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:46,639
changer i think

1072
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,679
is going to be coming from freeing up

1073
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,279
land through

1074
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:52,399
new technologies that are coming now

1075
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,880
with novel foods that decouple

1076
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,480
food production from land so for example

1077
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,119
renewable energies to feed

1078
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,719
electrons to microbes to grow protein or

1079
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,800
artificial meats and these kind of

1080
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,480
things just

1081
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,160
if we can free up land from food

1082
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,880
production then we can do a hell of a

1083
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,879
lot more with it

1084
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,159
i'd like to chime in and um thank you

1085
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,760
for bringing in the food system

1086
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:20,319
dominic i think when people talk about

1087
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,160
greenhouse gas emissions from food waste

1088
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,680
they almost only ever think about

1089
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,399
landfills

1090
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,118
and thinking about the if something like

1091
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,200
30

1092
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,079
of food is wasted in the u.s and

1093
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:34,239
similarly in many parts of the world

1094
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,599
that's a huge opportunity for increased

1095
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:40,159
efficiency

1096
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:42,480
so i think thinking about trying to

1097
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:44,159
not just find beneficial uses for some

1098
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,719
of those waste streams but actually

1099
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,239
eliminate the waste streams entirely and

1100
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,838
increase that efficiency

1101
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,719
as dominic said of nitrogen application

1102
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,679
to

1103
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,239
you know protein into the actual human

1104
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,679
diet

1105
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:02,159
is important and i would also point to

1106
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:02,960
that overall topic as an example where

1107
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:04,719
we do need

1108
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,960
systems thinking right so there are

1109
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,559
gadgets and widgets and technologies

1110
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,000
that need to be improved

1111
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:14,400
but i think there are there is

1112
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,358
huge opportunity to improve the way we

1113
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,000
manage

1114
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:20,000
systems such as the food system

1115
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
excellent thank you dominic peter

1116
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,320
natalie johannes anything to add or we

1117
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,960
move on to the next one

1118
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,240
maybe i'll ask i'll keep it going

1119
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,720
flipped aside of that

1120
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:31,919
um where do you think that we've already

1121
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,959
done enough research

1122
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,880
on ghg jhg's and agriculture what should

1123
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,599
we treat as settled issues so that we

1124
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,960
can focus

1125
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,960
on the bigger picture and some of the

1126
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,838
emerging game changers that you've

1127
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,838
identified

1128
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,200
well maybe i'll i'll try something here

1129
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,400
um uh

1130
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:53,679
i i i do

1131
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,880
think um that we that

1132
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:59,358
we're starting to converge that soil

1133
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,559
carbon sequestration is a possibility

1134
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:05,358
and that it has a high potential

1135
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:08,078
whether it can be achieved is a

1136
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,799
completely different story

1137
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,079
and and what can be achieved and where

1138
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,119
the trade-offs are

1139
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,960
and and i i think the um

1140
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,119
i don't know who mentioned it i'm sure

1141
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,920
it's on on dominic's

1142
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,039
um mind the trade-offs between n2o

1143
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,318
emissions and

1144
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,000
and uh and carbon sequestration but

1145
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,800
peter also mentioned the

1146
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,920
uh trade-offs between um nitrogen

1147
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,760
sequestration and phosphorus

1148
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,400
sequestration and carbon sequestration

1149
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,960
those

1150
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,760
those are all important considerations

1151
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,358
um

1152
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,480
i i do think we are we're slowly

1153
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:47,598
past uh sort of questioning the whole

1154
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,519
idea and getting into the weeds of

1155
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,599
actually making it happen and and i

1156
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,400
think that's a that's a really important

1157
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,838
step

1158
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:59,599
um that will then show some of the

1159
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:03,279
the um the weak parts of of uh

1160
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:06,880
actually doing it monitoring it um

1161
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,119
verifying it and re and and monetizing

1162
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,640
it

1163
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,640
which will probably need to happen um

1164
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:13,679
there are countries that are actually

1165
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:17,199
doing it there's

1166
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:20,799
uh always a a sort of um

1167
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:22,318
lingering vernacular that we can never

1168
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,119
measure soil carbon

1169
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:27,039
uh we can uh that's impossible and and

1170
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,240
while i agree that probably modeling and

1171
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,719
practice based

1172
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,719
asset assessments of soil carbon uh

1173
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:33,838
changes is is the more practical

1174
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:35,519
approach

1175
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:37,440
there are jurisdictions where they're

1176
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:40,079
actually measuring soil carbon

1177
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,200
after the fact and doling out money so

1178
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,680
also that can

1179
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,960
happen um and and we have not even

1180
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:48,000
really started

1181
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,280
um developing the tools in the sort of

1182
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,480
the digital agriculture space uh that uh

1183
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:57,599
that we could deploy uh to make this

1184
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,838
less a soil sampling and uh dry

1185
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,880
combustion analysis approach but

1186
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:05,039
but a much smarter approach so so i

1187
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,838
think we're we're already down that road

1188
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,838
um uh no i think we don't need to

1189
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,480
question the fundamental issues here

1190
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,318
um it's really about getting it done and

1191
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,838
developing the technology and the market

1192
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:20,000
mechanisms

1193
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:23,039
around it thanks a lot johannes

1194
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,239
let me just ask uh one one more question

1195
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,239
and then we'll turn it over to the

1196
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:28,000
audience um

1197
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,078
you mentioned market mechanisms and

1198
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,599
maybe that underpins all of this that if

1199
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,519
we don't have a carbon tax or a

1200
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,280
nationally based cap and trade maybe

1201
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:36,639
we don't have the appropriate incentives

1202
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,599
in place

1203
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,440
but um disregarding that from a public

1204
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,880
policy perspective and from a private

1205
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,000
sector perspective

1206
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,240
our current u.s and global priorities um

1207
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,639
directly correct with respect to the

1208
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,679
real opportunities for mitigating ghgs

1209
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,239
and agriculture

1210
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:56,799
do we have right and it's all about

1211
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,959
implementation at this point or

1212
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,200
what do we need to tell our our friends

1213
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,880
and in the political sphere

1214
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:04,879
in terms of what should be priorities

1215
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,280
okay i mean i'll try chiming in here

1216
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,559
it's a very it's a very difficult

1217
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,079
question to answer well because there

1218
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:13,759
are so many different

1219
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,119
priorities from different policy makers

1220
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,119
and different policies around the world

1221
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,000
so giving a generic answer that to that

1222
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,240
is

1223
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,519
extremely difficult but um i think that

1224
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:28,959
at the moment there seems to be

1225
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:32,239
more prioritization of these simple

1226
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,800
incremental changes and really no one

1227
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,479
taking a real stab at the systemic

1228
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,079
changes to the food system where the big

1229
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,760
gains are to be had

1230
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,599
so if i had a chance to say so the short

1231
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,440
answer is no i don't think

1232
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,119
that the prior prioritization is

1233
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,800
currently right because they're looking

1234
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,800
at incremental improvements

1235
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,560
small reductions in net greenhouse gas

1236
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,480
explanations from agriculture

1237
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:55,759
and we know that with really large

1238
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,719
systemic changes

1239
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,079
to how food is made and also to what

1240
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,000
people eat

1241
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,760
dietary change could can be a massive

1242
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,239
influence and tackling some of these

1243
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,839
bigger

1244
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:07,439
harder to tackle issues they're actually

1245
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:08,799
where the big gains are to be had

1246
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,358
and those are largely missing for the

1247
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,359
conversation

1248
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,200
thanks a lot dominic in the interest of

1249
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,480
time i'm going to turn it over

1250
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:24,159
to the floor now if you have a question

1251
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,159
just a mutant ask or

1252
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,800
david i think you had a question uh that

1253
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:30,559
that you're writing to me

1254
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,839
privately you want to post that publicly

1255
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:33,838
i think it's a very interesting one

1256
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,000
okay um i was getting confused finally

1257
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,159
what uh

1258
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,440
with the what johannes said at the very

1259
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:42,879
end because

1260
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,800
when i listened to the other talks

1261
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,358
before it seemed to me that

1262
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,839
the conclusion would be that the whole

1263
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:52,400
idea of of

1264
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:54,400
agriculture storing co

1265
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,760
uh soil organic matter and agriculture

1266
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,599
is kind of

1267
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,440
a very tiny part of the problem and

1268
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,280
probably fairly impossible and it could

1269
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,800
easily be undone etc etc so

1270
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,240
you know you said at the very end though

1271
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,079
johannes you said oh we know what we can

1272
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,318
do let's get going and

1273
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,480
but i got from the earlier talks that

1274
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,519
the money would just cause distortions

1275
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,079
and the farmers would

1276
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,639
game it and it's not that much anyway

1277
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,240
and they're

1278
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:22,480
much much bigger opportunities um

1279
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:24,078
and i've my impression is we should just

1280
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,679
forget this whole thing

1281
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,359
and go back to the soil health idea

1282
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:28,078
which is fine i mean what peter started

1283
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:30,400
with

1284
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,240
explaining all the benefits of of how we

1285
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,599
can manage organic matter and

1286
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:38,639
do good things in in yield and and soils

1287
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:41,440
are fine but to say we're part of the

1288
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:44,318
problem part of the solution to ghg

1289
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,400
maybe i missed the talk so maybe i

1290
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:49,679
misunderstood you johanna so that's

1291
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,519
i was all following along david rule

1292
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:56,000
number one just listen to me

1293
00:45:51,519 --> 00:46:00,318
um and then you're all good um

1294
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,519
okay um no i'm joking um no i i this is

1295
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,159
this is part of the

1296
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,759
the the nuance discussion and and i i

1297
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,920
really appreciate it because

1298
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,800
probably that's that's the impression

1299
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,519
that most people

1300
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,560
i i probably should should let dominic

1301
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,358
and peter talk

1302
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:16,239
um but uh no these are all nuances

1303
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:19,119
around it

1304
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:21,199
um but i i'm i'm putting words in their

1305
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,160
mouths now that they would probably not

1306
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:25,118
say we shouldn't

1307
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:26,078
do carbon we shouldn't do put carbon

1308
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,119
into the soil

1309
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,079
um and we shouldn't use the climate

1310
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,440
mechanism to

1311
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,318
help that um uh and uh

1312
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,920
whether or whether the market mechanisms

1313
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:38,719
can be developed i mean that that's

1314
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,800
that's always

1315
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:42,399
the question especially in this country

1316
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,079
um but there are other countries who

1317
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,880
have already done it and shown that it

1318
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,839
works

1319
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,720
uh so that's that's just a a us problem

1320
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,838
um

1321
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:54,719
but uh i i would say i i

1322
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:55,519
have not seen anything in peter's and

1323
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,519
dominic's

1324
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:02,880
talk that i wouldn't agree with um

1325
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:05,039
and yet i still agree with my uh

1326
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,559
points as well so we have to get those

1327
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,920
together into one

1328
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,719
uh yes uh it's a distributed issue um

1329
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,920
yes

1330
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:15,759
uh there are trade offs um yes we

1331
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,240
probably always need to prioritize soil

1332
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,119
health

1333
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:21,358
um and and that's the farmer will always

1334
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,240
prioritize that and that's

1335
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,598
even now if we drive down soil health

1336
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,639
with carbon sequestration

1337
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,318
that not only the farmers is uh

1338
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:33,039
not happy about it and will not do it

1339
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:35,279
but also in terms of many other systems

1340
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:38,079
such as biochar it's probably

1341
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,480
better to to make energy from biomass

1342
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,280
than

1343
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,079
than buy a char if if if yields go down

1344
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,400
um

1345
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,920
because then it's a wash in terms of the

1346
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,079
greenhouse gas balance

1347
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,200
uh so so i i haven't seen anything that

1348
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,200
that is wrong

1349
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,558
uh in the statements that were made and

1350
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:57,199
we need to get those

1351
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,400
all together in the mix well i wanted it

1352
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:01,519
i'll chime in on this

1353
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,599
for just a moment i think

1354
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:05,039
i i think we do have areas of agreement

1355
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,039
and to some extent

1356
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,800
i think dominic played a very useful

1357
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:10,639
role of of

1358
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,000
of being a skeptic and and that's

1359
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,039
important because there is

1360
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
so much hot air around this topic so to

1361
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:19,199
speak

1362
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,239
um i think in my mind

1363
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,199
one of the challenges is there are

1364
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,919
technical

1365
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:27,598
solutions and we can say if you do this

1366
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,680
practice in this cropping system

1367
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,160
you will increase soil carbon and on

1368
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:35,358
average you will increase yields etc so

1369
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:37,440
there are plenty of technical

1370
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:39,358
improvements to current management that

1371
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,079
take a systems approach

1372
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,838
to an agronomic system and say look we

1373
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,960
get better yields

1374
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:50,239
we get better soil health and we get a

1375
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,079
reduced greenhouse gas emissions so

1376
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,318
so we need to promote those systems and

1377
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,200
make them happen i think a big question

1378
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,960
in my mind

1379
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:01,759
is how do you make that happen

1380
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,280
and the simple idea in the u.s and

1381
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,680
elsewhere of

1382
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,599
a payment to an individual farmer for an

1383
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:08,799
individual practice on an individual

1384
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,920
field

1385
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:15,440
whether that's in the u.s or or

1386
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,639
in bangladesh there are huge problems

1387
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,519
with this concept um this is a tragedy

1388
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:22,799
of the commons

1389
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:25,440
and i think the challenge is

1390
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,760
managing the land at a bigger scale than

1391
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,440
a single field or a portion of a field

1392
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,400
etc so some of the issues in measuring

1393
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,000
soil carbon

1394
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,318
or measuring benefits if we could really

1395
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,480
get

1396
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:39,440
farmers in the mississippi river basin

1397
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,318
to change

1398
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,639
their fertilizer practices and change

1399
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:47,920
soil health practices

1400
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:49,279
at a massive scale it wouldn't be so

1401
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,760
hard to measure it

1402
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,839
right if we weren't trying to measure it

1403
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,920
on every field

1404
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,279
we could be doing this from tall towers

1405
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,639
and say there's less

1406
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,839
co2 emission there's less nitrous oxide

1407
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:05,598
right so i think in my mind that's what

1408
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:09,039
we need to be thinking about is

1409
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:11,838
what are the social and and

1410
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:14,079
political and organizational mechanisms

1411
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:16,880
by which we motivate change

1412
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,559
if we can do that at scale then some of

1413
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,039
these measurement issues go away

1414
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,400
and some of the gaming issues etc go

1415
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:25,199
away

1416
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,800
thanks peter very interesting okay can i

1417
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:28,480
chime in on this one as well so thank

1418
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,760
you david for bringing that up i was

1419
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,039
hoping to stir up a little bit of

1420
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,520
controversy and

1421
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,039
a discussion around this point so uh

1422
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:36,639
mission accomplished

1423
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:38,558
um yeah i don't think we're in

1424
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:40,719
disagreement um

1425
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,640
i i say i don't think anything by talk

1426
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:44,558
said that the soul carbon is a bad thing

1427
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,838
it has many mult it has many benefits

1428
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,160
for water quality

1429
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:49,519
uh for cropping practices you know cover

1430
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:51,199
crops um are useful

1431
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:52,239
in terms of people farmers are doing

1432
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:53,519
them anyway because they're good in

1433
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:54,558
their crop practices not because they're

1434
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:57,838
trying to store

1435
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:59,599
um fight climate change no-till is

1436
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:01,039
extremely common in dry lands because

1437
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,599
farmers want to do it because it helps

1438
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:03,279
them

1439
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,680
balance their water budget and improve

1440
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,480
yields so there are many reasons for

1441
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:10,480
doing things that store carbon soils

1442
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,000
what i've tried to inject some real

1443
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,240
caution about though

1444
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,318
is having people uh overselling the idea

1445
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,838
that this is a silver bullet

1446
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:21,838
which is a lot of excitement around in

1447
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:23,039
the press maybe not in academia as much

1448
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:25,279
but if you look outside

1449
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,279
in blogs and papers and things like that

1450
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,079
people see saul carmen as being the

1451
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,040
answer

1452
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,000
that's you know and that maybe gives

1453
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:33,759
people

1454
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,119
a thought they're gonna maybe take the

1455
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,640
foot off the pedal we've got climate

1456
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,240
change sorted we don't need to worry so

1457
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,879
much about the other things

1458
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:42,000
and really it can make at best an

1459
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,440
incremental

1460
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,719
impact although when we see

1461
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,800
if we see numbers saying it's it

1462
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,239
produces it stores a low carbon

1463
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,599
of course in the first few years when

1464
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:53,358
you start practice it stores a lot of

1465
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,359
carbon but that doesn't persist

1466
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:57,039
it reaches a new equilibrium and you

1467
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,400
need to keep doing that practice forever

1468
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:00,239
and after a decade or a couple of

1469
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,200
decades you're not getting any impact on

1470
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:02,719
climate change

1471
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,480
so this is why we need to be thinking

1472
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,838
about the long-term total potential

1473
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,079
rather than the short-term

1474
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:08,880
annual potential and this is where i

1475
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,960
think we need to

1476
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,960
manage people's expectations not because

1477
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,159
cell carbon is a bad thing but

1478
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,159
simply because we need to maintain the

1479
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,759
sense of urgency about the other things

1480
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:21,279
to do with climate change which are more

1481
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,720
impactful and more important in the

1482
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,960
climate change

1483
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:27,118
realm well that's why the four per mill

1484
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,358
was so intellectually dishonest

1485
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,358
because they said that every year you

1486
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:33,920
could keep increasing

1487
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:36,239
at 4 4 per ml and keep on going and

1488
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,000
going and going and going and i

1489
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:40,879
maybe i just don't like intellectual

1490
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,800
dishonesty of course they've pivoted

1491
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,640
quite a bit from that if you go to their

1492
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,359
website it's all about soil health which

1493
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:46,879
is fine

1494
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:49,119
and about yields which is fine but

1495
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,960
anyway dominic you provoked me so there

1496
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,240
you go

1497
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,720
we've got to go to another meeting now

1498
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:55,439
so thank you david um we're over time

1499
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:57,679
but i'd like to

1500
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,079
entertain one more question if jenny is

1501
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:02,318
still online

1502
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,599
hi this is a question for dominic and

1503
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:06,639
johannes so

1504
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:09,920
in dominic you had that blue and uh

1505
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:11,358
orange bar chart and you show that

1506
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,800
basically

1507
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:15,679
biomass turned into biochar is basically

1508
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,760
equivalent

1509
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:20,639
in terms of its mitigation as bioenergy

1510
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,680
just displacing fossil fuels

1511
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,480
and so my question is in helping summon

1512
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:26,719
make

1513
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,000
and in the context of natalie talking

1514
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:32,399
about how important it is to

1515
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:35,440
keep fossilized carbon fossilized

1516
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,800
how do we give the relative value of say

1517
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:42,000
the 100 year biochar sequestration

1518
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:45,039
versus the 1 million year bio

1519
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,880
energy displacement so when we're

1520
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:47,759
helping people come up with a decision

1521
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,599
tree now of course

1522
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,720
this is a yes and question because there

1523
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,720
are situations where

1524
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:57,199
you know it's probably more amenable to

1525
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:58,000
making biochar versus bioenergy so i'm

1526
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:00,719
just trying to

1527
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,920
understand how can i think about how to

1528
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:04,399
frame it

1529
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,400
to a

1530
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,039
plus bio energy and when might you

1531
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
choose bio

1532
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:15,119
energy even if it has a slightly less

1533
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,719
total mitigation because it's keeping

1534
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,760
that fossilized carbon with a

1535
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:23,439
thousand-year lifespan in the ground

1536
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,599
yeah so i had a paper a couple of years

1537
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,280
ago 2016 i think published in nature

1538
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,640
communications johannes was also a

1539
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,960
co-author on that

1540
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:32,000
looking at exactly this question when

1541
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,800
might we do

1542
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
so i compared in fact bioenergy biochar

1543
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,519
and bex in the same

1544
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,119
thing and it's a very complicated um

1545
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:42,400
decision space because there are so many

1546
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,039
factors that might drive you one way or

1547
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,639
the other

1548
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:46,239
uh if you're looking at places where

1549
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:47,279
there's very little opportunity to

1550
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:49,279
offset

1551
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,960
fossil fuels for example a country that

1552
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,559
has already got

1553
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,480
or in the future already has a lot of

1554
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,839
renewable energy for example

1555
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,440
then that's going to push you towards

1556
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,119
favoring something that stores carbon

1557
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,838
rather than offsets energy

1558
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,519
um so the the whole space that it

1559
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:05,440
operates in is quite complicated but

1560
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,519
there's still a simple message from it

1561
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,358
what it seemed to be is that in our

1562
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,400
current world

1563
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:14,239
where our energy systems are quite

1564
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,280
carbon intensive

1565
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:19,919
and carbon prices are very low

1566
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,280
we would probably prefer to make um most

1567
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,119
people would prefer to go the more the

1568
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,040
bioenergy route at the moment

1569
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,640
now there's a transition once energy

1570
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:28,318
which carbon prices go above about a

1571
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:30,318
hundred dollars per ton of car

1572
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,759
co2 sort of three to four hundred

1573
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,558
dollars per ton of carbon

1574
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,920
and at that point in locations where the

1575
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,359
biochar is actually really

1576
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,559
helping improve your crop productive

1577
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:40,480
productivity because that's another

1578
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:43,599
review dimensions how does it in fact

1579
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,440
impact your soil fertility so in places

1580
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,280
where it's actually got a useful benefit

1581
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,559
particularly the tropics to soils

1582
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:53,280
there we would introduce more um

1583
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,160
more biochar and then there's another

1584
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,599
transition some

1585
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:57,039
people sometimes think that if you want

1586
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,838
to store more carbon if you want to

1587
00:55:57,039 --> 00:55:59,199
improve

1588
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:00,880
the prospects for technology you just

1589
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:02,558
need to throw more money at it

1590
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,079
and that's actually not true at all if

1591
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,040
you increase the carbon price much

1592
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,880
beyond that

1593
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:08,558
other things that were uneconomic at

1594
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,200
those carbon prices become the favored

1595
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,519
option like

1596
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,639
bioenergy for carbon capture and storage

1597
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,239
so at higher

1598
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:16,000
very high carbon prices in fact you

1599
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:18,159
would even stop making biochar and

1600
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,280
direct all your efforts into these

1601
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:24,399
the tallest bar on that chart yeah i

1602
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,960
i agree with that and uh just one one

1603
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,680
addition to that um one can also look at

1604
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,880
that

1605
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:33,919
um sort of from a geopolitical and

1606
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:37,599
uh dimension of a very very

1607
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:40,798
high uh perspective and say

1608
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:42,079
well there are many many uh ways to

1609
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:45,039
generate energy

1610
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,720
um but there is practically only one

1611
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:49,358
viable way to make

1612
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:50,480
organic carbon out of uh co2 that's

1613
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:55,679
photosynthesis

1614
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:58,400
so as as much as we can keeping

1615
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:59,759
co2 in an organic form and creating

1616
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,639
value on earth

1617
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,040
for humanity is a better way to to do

1618
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:05,759
than

1619
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:06,639
returning it as co2 even if we offset

1620
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,760
some other

1621
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:12,159
um non-desirable thing so that's sort of

1622
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,880
my more philosophical geopolitical view

1623
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:15,519
on that

1624
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,318
why i would if possible always favor

1625
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,318
keeping more

1626
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:26,159
more organic carbon on earth

1627
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:28,480
thank you thanks dominic

1628
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:29,519
johannes peter you also want to make a

1629
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:34,079
comment about

1630
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:38,239
uh n in in methane

1631
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:40,480
yes very briefly i just want to say um

1632
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:42,159
because the popular press focuses so

1633
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,079
much on carbon

1634
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:46,078
uh it's really important to remember

1635
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,240
that in agriculture

1636
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,640
greenhouse gas emissions are entirely

1637
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,239
dominated by nitrous oxide and methane

1638
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:55,598
and that's totally different from any

1639
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:58,318
other sector so at the global scale

1640
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:00,318
those are are a small part of the issue

1641
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:02,000
but if you're interested in agriculture

1642
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:02,960
and greenhouse gas mitigation in

1643
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,599
agriculture

1644
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,318
you absolutely have to pay attention to

1645
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,039
methane

1646
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:09,920
and nitrous oxide and that's important

1647
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:12,798
because

1648
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,720
everything's not always a win-win and of

1649
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:16,798
course carbon and nitrogen are

1650
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:17,919
are stoichiometrically linked in soil

1651
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:20,000
and elsewhere

1652
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,838
so you know we're talking about carbon

1653
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,440
and nitrogen cycling and and that's

1654
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:27,199
important i think

1655
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:28,318
uh to remember and and in terms of

1656
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:32,000
focusing on

1657
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:37,279
on solutions and avoiding uh problems

1658
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:39,838
disguised as solutions

1659
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,760
excellent thank you peter um we are 10

1660
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:42,078
minutes over time now so i think we

1661
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,599
should

1662
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,440
officially close but i really like to

1663
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,400
thank the panel it was fascinating

1664
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,240
discussion

1665
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,000
and i'm hoping you'll consent to do a

1666
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:51,679
spring follow-on because i suspect

1667
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,119
that we could talk about this for a full

1668
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:54,078
day and only start to scratch the

1669
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,318
surface

1670
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,079
so thank you so much everybody it's a

1671
00:58:56,318 --> 00:58:59,039
it's been a delight to have you put the

1672
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,880
panel together

1673
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:05,838
and thanks everybody else for attending

1674
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,838
see you next week

1675
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,838
this has been a production of cornell

1676
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:18,400
university

1677
