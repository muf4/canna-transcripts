1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,640
thank you very much neil and bill for

4
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,519
the invitation i'm really uh honored to

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,920
come on this fellowship here to

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,079
tell you a little bit more maybe how

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,199
we are managing the resource the peat

8
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:29,198
resource in canada and say when i say we

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,840
we can talk a little bit about we

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,719
because

11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,119
it involves the canadian sphenum peat

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,280
moss association with regroups all the

13
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,119
peat producer of canada and i've been

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,520
working in collaboration with them since

15
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,878
1992

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,800
exchanging information and all that so

17
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,320
but more specifically today i will talk

18
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,159
about the all we go about to restore uh

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,840
industrial peatland

20
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:00,718
and the main factors that

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,719
impedes this recovery

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,320
so the plan for today i will talk a

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,478
little bit about the restoration context

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,239
in north america

25
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,519
which is a different than what's going

26
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,319
on in europe

27
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:15,199
uh the restoration ecology of peatland

28
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,199
so introducing the our conceptual

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,000
framework of research

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,600
and the main ibiotic factor in painting

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,560
and talking about how we go about to

32
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,399
evaluate success and if

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,040
i will check somebody will check on time

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,560
and if i have time then um

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,040
uh because most i will talk about

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,359
sphenum dominated petan or the you know

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,439
the sign on peat moss but i can start

38
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,319
with what we're doing uh with fan

39
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,798
research fan restoration research and

40
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,839
the pool also restoration within the

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,840
piedmont

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,840
so the business of horticultural peat

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,719
if we are impacting an ecosystem

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,599
environment why should we go on to do

45
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,078
that

46
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,319
if there's alternative

47
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,959
there might be some alternative to using

48
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,639
peat in growing media such as the core

49
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,438
the cocoa fibers

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,478
or rock wool or but all of them will

51
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:07,359
have

52
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,399
you know

53
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,800
its array of problems also in terms of

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,759
its use its environmental problem

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,760
peat is good just uh

56
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,598
the people that do not know sphyno is

57
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,639
because they have this amazing cell

58
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:25,598
structure of alternating

59
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:28,000
lives living cells and dead cells with

60
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,719
lots of pores and and it works a little

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,039
bit like a slinky you can compress it

62
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,800
but as soon as you release the pressure

63
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,959
then you have the structure

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,439
so it's really good that wicking

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,280
the the water and having water into the

66
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,000
substrate and keeping some water there

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,318
but also we have with all this for this

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,800
aeration and we can get oxygen down to

69
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,199
the root so that's just the basic gets a

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,000
good catalina exchange capacity and all

71
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,318
that

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,400
i think neil and and

73
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,199
bill could tell you a lot more about

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
its property but it's just a fantastic

75
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,598
uh

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,239
medium to grow plants in and it's not so

77
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,079
easy to all at once get rid of it they

78
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,840
tried that in england

79
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
uh they forced the government just

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,319
banned the use of pete but they realized

81
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,719
the professional world just could not

82
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,958
go away from it and

83
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,039
just to tell you a little bit about a

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,280
little bit more about why it's not so

85
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,318
easy to shift and get rid of all at once

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,719
of repeat is we're thinking compose okay

87
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,439
in the last 10 15 years we all agree

88
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,560
compose composting now green residue is

89
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,039
a lot

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,519
uh it's more stable and we can get

91
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,158
better growing media out of compost but

92
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,680
the problem in places like in europe or

93
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,318
central europe

94
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,040
is that the green residue are used

95
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,919
uh for for the cent the thermal station

96
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,239
this the to produce energy so they are

97
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,679
not easily available it's not a product

98
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,158
that is it's too

99
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,920
costly for the professional grower to

100
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,479
use so then

101
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,518
for them they rely on peat and then if

102
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,679
you go for the choir the core the coming

103
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,759
from the cocoa fibers then again there's

104
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,319
other issue when you look at the overall

105
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,079
life cycle analysis where it comes from

106
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,000
and that permanently the transport is

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,879
kind of polluting on these old boats

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,519
also

109
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:20,399
in the ocean with this diesel bowl that

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,240
are not so up-to-date so

111
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,638
i think we have to all this product i'm

112
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,879
not saying this is yet the best thing to

113
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,199
use but i think now we have to start to

114
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,159
look more the overall picture the social

115
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,720
impact

116
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,800
the traveling and the the the whole life

117
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,960
cycle analysis of the different products

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,240
so

119
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,839
when you harvest the peatland

120
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,478
usually set

121
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,519
ditches every 30 meters this is the main

122
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,199
ditches

123
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,198
and you have this vacuum drowned

124
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,400
tractor

125
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,319
that will

126
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,719
harvest the peat so you hire the pea

127
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,199
surface let it dry in the sun two three

128
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,199
days later you go with a big vacuum pick

129
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,160
it up two three

130
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,400
four millimeters at a time drop it there

131
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,960
then you charge it onto trucks that

132
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,959
takes to the plant so

133
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,159
some large scale operation will look

134
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,638
like this

135
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,520
and yeah just one we don't see trees we

136
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,639
don't see seeds nothing is left and

137
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:25,038
nothing we know that 30 centimeter below

138
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,680
the soil the peatland there's no seed

139
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,599
bank left okay so it's not there

140
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,199
so the first question we asked what is

141
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,280
the

142
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,160
ecological distance to restore this how

143
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,079
do we fix this gap between what you saw

144
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,280
and what a natural peatland can look

145
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,680
like you know it's that's quite a step

146
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,719
that's what we uh

147
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,120
and

148
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,360
i just say what i'm showing today comes

149
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,199
from you know it's been developed with

150
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
lots of people it's not all at once it

151
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,759
looks easy but we worked 20 years in our

152
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,880
partnership with the canadian peat

153
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,720
industry

154
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,439
and this is like

155
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,319
close to 22 partner and the way it works

156
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,719
in canada is that the federal government

157
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,039
the research council they say that if

158
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,880
the industry industry is interested

159
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,680
when they put one dollar we put one

160
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,000
dollar for financing the research so

161
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,879
more or less it's the way it lies it

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,800
goes and then through these

163
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,120
20 years there was numerous you know

164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,439
post-doc phd student and master's

165
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,519
students and research fields assistant

166
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,319
and volunteer even i know some students

167
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,120
from

168
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,919
uh cornell came and worked up uh with us

169
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,800
so

170
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,198
um just to say that i'm grateful for all

171
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,840
the work with these students

172
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,800
so the way we work is

173
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,198
first

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,759
we start by comparing the reference

175
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,840
ecosystem so which is the notion of

176
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,800
these a set of natural ecosystem in our

177
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,198
region to what has been degraded and we

178
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,800
look at the degraded ecosystem

179
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,038
to see

180
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,319
what is this ecological distance we have

181
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,639
to feel

182
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,439
what should we

183
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,240
do

184
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,319
and then we do that by comparing from my

185
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,560
part because i'm the plant ecologist but

186
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,639
we are business disciplinary team

187
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,319
there's people that do the same thing

188
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,720
with hydrology

189
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,360
or the microbiology the microbes

190
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,160
population but for me i will more focus

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,160
today on on my specialty within the team

192
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,400
which is the plant ecology so i compare

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,800
the plant structure the composition how

194
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,638
i differ and the different functions how

195
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,560
it differs

196
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,280
and if you take

197
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,918
meal plate as i've shown you the

198
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,318
distance is much better greater than

199
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,680
when we used to block cut pain

200
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,960
like this is what we used to do

201
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,720
traditionally or the way that now

202
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,399
that some people are still doing it but

203
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,440
on a smaller scale

204
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,359
but the big distance is really more what

205
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,439
my research has been focused mostly on

206
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,080
this but we are doing research in that

207
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,160
area that i will not talk about today

208
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,318
so if we do no management in a

209
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,879
sphenum-dominated peatland

210
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,639
we uh inventory

211
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,000
395

212
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,280
abandoned peat field all across

213
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,879
canada

214
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,359
mostly than the eastern part this is

215
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,919
where the industry mostly is and i just

216
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,479
want to draw your attention that if you

217
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,639
have natural peatland

218
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,719
and compared to the vacuum and here our

219
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,639
ecosystem were it's close to 600

220
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,039
plots you know that we took in natural

221
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,038
peatland throughout the the

222
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,360
the eastern part of canada

223
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:36,559
look in general in peter and you will

224
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,120
find about 70 75

225
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,399
of sphenom where there's barely any and

226
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,399
what you found there is mostly what you

227
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,759
found in the ditches but not so much in

228
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,919
the peat field

229
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,278
okay the same thing with the irrigation

230
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,519
shrubs you know there's a lot more

231
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,080
pressure of natural feed than

232
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,560
in a degraded system and look at the

233
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,278
bare peat you know we have no bear peak

234
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,838
in natural system and this is

235
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,759
just you know

236
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,839
and then we did the same thing with fan

237
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,399
which in a different system okay bug are

238
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,040
dominated by sphyno mussels finn are

239
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,958
dominated by sedges and brown mussels

240
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,039
another type of masses

241
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:16,239
fan paint is

242
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,639
starting more to go into growing media

243
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,839
but mostly it's being used a lot for

244
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,480
energy

245
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,200
consumption in ireland central europe

246
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,320
and russia below russia and these places

247
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,519
but we look in these different

248
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,320
provinces including here

249
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,519
in michigan the the because as you go

250
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,160
down in the peat profile in the p10 you

251
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,560
get down to the fan layers because the

252
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,799
your piton develops as you know a leg

253
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,399
button and will start to accumulate with

254
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,599
organic material

255
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,278
then sedges typha plants like that will

256
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,560
start to fill it up and that's where you

257
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,200
get your

258
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,079
fan peat where you are still have inputs

259
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,360
from

260
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,200
the

261
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,360
different streams around or from the

262
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,278
mineral ground flowing through it and

263
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839
then with time you have

264
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,559
accumulation of the organic matter

265
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,880
then slowly you get rid of the influence

266
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,639
of the mineral the mineral trophy or

267
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,600
from the

268
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,360
inputs from the runoff of the different

269
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,360
streams and you'll get only the

270
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,320
influence that the system will be fed

271
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,639
only by rain water and then ph will go

272
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,240
down sphenum gets in the system sphenol

273
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:31,360
gets the ph kicks in the ph to go okay

274
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,399
and then looking now comparing

275
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
22

276
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,519
uh peat extracted fan compared to

277
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,519
pretend on disturb then we found that

278
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,278
here we there was two techniques on time

279
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,360
of getting the peat out sometimes it was

280
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,679
drained not drained but you see the

281
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,240
sedges the carrot species in natural

282
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,639
pita on much higher abundance where they

283
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,120
are barely present in these abundant

284
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,519
system and the sphenom the richer cyanum

285
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,278
species so i know centralia and all that

286
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,360
not so much that you found they're

287
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,759
closely not there so

288
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,159
you know we see that even though system

289
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,278
has been abandoned for a long time

290
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:09,360
up to 40 years they are not there

291
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,559
second step now we have to work to

292
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,879
define goals if you want to do

293
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,719
restoration you have to define your goal

294
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,480
if you don't know your goals

295
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,079
it's hard to evaluate your success you

296
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,159
don't know where you're going

297
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:24,078
but goals can not only cannot be done

298
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:25,919
only by scientists or ecologists minded

299
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,199
you have to take care of what's going on

300
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,278
around you in your

301
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,040
society in your community

302
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,519
but ecologically

303
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,278
we know that the restore ecosystem

304
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,120
will not be like

305
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,679
the original one

306
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,720
so you have to define your goals that

307
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,479
will be that but usually nobody will put

308
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,320
we're just going to restore the original

309
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,000
ecosystem that was there before we

310
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,240
cannot do that we don't have the same

311
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,240
climatic history it will not be the same

312
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,639
evolution we're on the on under

313
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,480
different climate now so definitely the

314
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,680
restoration system the restaurant system

315
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
will be there

316
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,000
sometime

317
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,240
in the time so we have this time scale

318
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
here

319
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,639
goal defining goal is really different

320
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,560
differs from your community i've been

321
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,680
involved with uh people working in

322
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,359
alaska and the main concert in alaska if

323
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,078
we're going to work with the peatland

324
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,480
that was complete then what

325
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,958
is all the fastest way we can again

326
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,000
stabilize the peat so we won't get all

327
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:30,638
the pits to go in the streams and clog

328
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,879
the rivers that are so important for the

329
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,560
salmon industry it's the fishing

330
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,039
industry so

331
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,039
i can tell you if you talk with anybody

332
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,039
in alaska the first thing they will be

333
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,360
thinking is hey peach should be

334
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,360
stabilized as soon as possible after we

335
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,519
finish using the peat for

336
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,399
whatever reason

337
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,959
in canada with the peat industry the

338
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,480
articulate peat industry we did several

339
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,599
workshops and all that and after

340
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
a

341
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,839
different

342
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,479
um

343
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,839
discussion the general long-term goal we

344
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,519
decided was to restore the most unique

345
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,639
characteristic that defines piton

346
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,120
ecosystem which is its capacity to

347
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,360
accumulate p through time so to

348
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,440
sequester carbon through time

349
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,039
p trans are the most efficient ecosystem

350
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,160
we have on this planet

351
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,679
per you know square meter or per volume

352
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,439
that can sequester

353
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,958
carbon on a long time

354
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,959
you know after that you'll have the coal

355
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,278
formation

356
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,958
but really

357
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,559
the peak is more efficient than you can

358
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,319
have forest because forests you plant

359
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,879
trees but 200 years down the line the

360
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,320
trees dies again and the carbon is put

361
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,120
back into the

362
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,320
every circulation so that's the general

363
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,759
long-term goal long-term goal that

364
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,920
we put together because in north america

365
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:54,319
in muslim canada we were in a wetland

366
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,479
system we use a wetland system

367
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,000
if we leave it you usually birch will

368
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,120
invade it will turn into a birch

369
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,198
woodland or pine woodland and we have

370
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,639
plenty of woodlands in canada but in

371
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,198
southern even though we have a lot of

372
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,600
peatlands in canada there's plenty of it

373
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,359
we don't have so many in the south

374
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,360
nearby the urban area you know there's a

375
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,720
lot of pressure on the wetlands so

376
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,639
that's where

377
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,680
we decided to work and this was

378
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,839
influenced by the kenyan usa uh policy

379
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,078
of no net loss of wetland and the usa

380
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,760
wetland hacks you know overall and and

381
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,159
the reason it was influenced by that is

382
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:31,759
because the clients are mostly americans

383
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,639
85 85 percent of the peat is sold in the

384
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,879
states

385
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,240
and so we we

386
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:41,278
we are taking into account some of the

387
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,399
concerns that the clients restoration

388
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,399
limits

389
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,120
like i told you impossible to restore

390
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,839
the original ecosystem by prior to peat

391
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,278
extracting activities this is not you

392
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,839
know uh one of the goal

393
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,720
and peat is not a renewable resources

394
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,199
within human lifetime but the potential

395
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,959
needs here when i say you always have to

396
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,120
define this when you start talking about

397
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,919
this and here i'm talking i'm just

398
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,560
defining the spatial area as being what

399
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,360
is owned and seen by a pet company

400
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,759
okay if we compare it to the potential

401
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,278
of all of our all above all across

402
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,278
canada yeah you could say pete is

403
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,000
renewable because it's

404
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,838
tiny what we are extracting compared to

405
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
the amount of people we have in canada

406
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,199
but a lot of it is on the permafrost and

407
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,360
not available

408
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,838
okay so

409
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,720
the shortened goal is really to favor

410
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,600
the establishment of spinal muscles

411
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,800
or now mostly doing a lot of research on

412
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,600
the ground muscles and surgeons

413
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:44,319
depending on the military fee and mostly

414
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,480
it is well known all these

415
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,040
spinal muscles are really ecosystem

416
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,120
engineer they are the key species in the

417
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:54,799
northern hemisphere to get

418
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,399
peatland in the uh in the system

419
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,159
so there's a

420
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,759
third step that i'm skipping which is

421
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,480
all the planification which is really

422
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,120
important to succeed in restoration

423
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,639
but as ecologists we work a lot on

424
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,639
defining

425
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,919
what are the constraints

426
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,959
to

427
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:16,240
why is it that our system is not going

428
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:19,039
along that way naturally and how can we

429
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,480
ameliorate this constraint they can be

430
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,198
environmental

431
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,839
and that's mostly all my earlier

432
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,278
research was been done in in the spheno

433
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,600
type of peatland

434
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,879
there can be a problem of dispersion

435
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,440
and

436
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:36,000
this i'm not doing much research on this

437
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,560
because we did it in the beginning

438
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
things do come in the plants the the

439
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,319
spores

440
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,159
and all that but the condition is so

441
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,199
harsh nothing established so we know we

442
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,600
have to

443
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,278
just bring the plant material here so

444
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,320
you won't hear a lot much about research

445
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:54,559
about that and this is the interspecific

446
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,560
interaction plant plant interaction they

447
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,719
do come in for the fans but i will not

448
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,799
discuss this much today

449
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,000
so

450
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:08,078
and the process of ecostem restoration

451
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,599
then we will also do some monitoring to

452
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,078
adapt

453
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,159
okay so if we do no management things

454
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:17,198
that happen we know that the peat

455
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,919
oxidation will continue at a rate of 5.7

456
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,839
millimeter per year so it's a net carbon

457
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,360
emission you have an ecosystem you

458
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,678
wonder you use a resource and if you

459
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,599
abandon the system it goes on you see

460
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,400
here trees that establish they get

461
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:34,159
uprooted through time and there's uh dr

462
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,080
maria strak she's from university of

463
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,919
calgary and she's really our carbon

464
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,879
flock specialist working on all these

465
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,080
questions within our group if we do no

466
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,320
management

467
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,399
all the water chemistry is unstable

468
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,519
because it's coupled with we get a

469
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,640
greater water table fluctuation also so

470
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:55,359
we have a problem with nutrient and in

471
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,960
the chemistry and this we work with uh

472
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,918
jonathan price is a pico necrologist

473
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,240
from universal waterloo and myself i do

474
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,038
work on the chemistry

475
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,919
peak

476
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:10,000
erosion the water will impede

477
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,000
you know the vegetation return so

478
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,600
we have to take care of that and also

479
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,200
the wind

480
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,759
you know will impede the vegetation

481
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,360
return so this is all this this

482
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,798
different aspects

483
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,798
and if we do

484
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,279
in some cases do nothing we'll have the

485
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,679
woodland would replace

486
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:31,038
on this final mosses so either here you

487
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,759
see the birches or the pinewood lens

488
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:37,359
and we get severe constraint by uh

489
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:40,079
defrost heating i'll come back on this

490
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,759
and if we don't restore here this is a

491
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,079
site i visited

492
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,440
in colorado

493
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:49,918
somehow in colorado 100 to 120 years ago

494
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,759
they the the silver mine they had to use

495
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,160
pete in the process

496
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,558
and these are two colleagues david

497
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,360
cooper from us of colorado's from the

498
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,119
boulder and rob chambers from michigan

499
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,479
tech university

500
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,839
and we do a lot of exchange because they

501
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,839
do they've been working on fan

502
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,439
restoration mostly

503
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,319
and now they're starting to adapt some

504
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,120
of our techniques

505
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,519
this is the thromos that you will see

506
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,199
later but some other things makes them

507
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,558
these sites you know this is a site

508
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,679
abandoned

509
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:23,599
between 100 and 120 years and with all

510
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,559
the harsh conditions plants do not come

511
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,599
back on the peat not so well easy

512
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,678
and then

513
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,439
if you have a fan then you get this kind

514
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,880
of literal species that you have to

515
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,960
compete with

516
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,720
okay so

517
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,960
just to give you an example you won't go

518
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,200
into that but just to say that we did a

519
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,880
lot of work to understand if we were

520
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,200
introduced plans

521
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,160
what can we do to help mostly the

522
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,640
sphenum establishment all our research

523
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,798
has been key to that and this is the

524
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,559
website where we have all our

525
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,639
publications if you're going to put it's

526
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,639
all in english website you can have

527
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,759
access to all the publication

528
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,679
of this uh and what i wanted to say that

529
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,359
what is in yellow are the three

530
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,080
necessary steps

531
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,158
that needs to be done if you don't omit

532
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,399
one of these steps you won't succeed to

533
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,400
restore people you need to reintroduce

534
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,880
your plant material

535
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,840
you need to protect it after that mulch

536
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,640
it because the muscles have no roots

537
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,079
okay no way of controlling the

538
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
loss of water

539
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,720
and

540
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,480
still even if you do those two things

541
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,798
you need to block the former drainage

542
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,720
system you need to re-wet the cycle

543
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:36,558
the combination of these three actions

544
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:41,038
will lead you usually to successful

545
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:42,399
one example of one of these let's say a

546
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,440
line of work

547
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,080
is uh the sudden the abiotic factor

548
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,400
the peat surface when we abandon them

549
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,639
can get very hot can be really hot up to

550
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,559
50 degrees c

551
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,320
um

552
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,000
at first we were wondering is it because

553
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,000
there's some toxicity that the plant

554
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,880
don't come back there's no toxicity and

555
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,919
actually even nitrogen is is there

556
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,440
because you have oxidation but no plants

557
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,280
is taking it up so you have even more

558
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,200
nitrogen than the natural glucose so

559
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,119
that should not be but then you have

560
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,679
this biological cross

561
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,279
algae or lichen sometimes and this

562
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,600
really impedes the muscles to have

563
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,158
access to the water underneath so

564
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,319
there's a breakage in the capillary

565
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,120
action

566
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,759
so

567
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,759
we wanted to know at the same time okay

568
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,079
so i have my colleagues looking at the

569
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,798
climate microclimate and what's going on

570
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:37,279
in ideology and myself i go in the lab

571
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,679
and then i wanted to know what kills the

572
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,158
mosses when are they dead really you

573
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,640
know if i'm reintroduced them

574
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,240
what adverse condition can they

575
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,640
sustain so either with temperature or

576
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,558
here just submitted them to some known

577
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,720
relative humidity created by so like

578
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,359
they were suspended in the air and then

579
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,000
looking back for 10 weeks you know if

580
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,599
they would start to regrow again what if

581
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,119
they were dead or not

582
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,678
so um

583
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,439
that's the way and and with this

584
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,519
i found out that you know

585
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
if your relative humidity is low just

586
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,519
for a few hours every everything is is

587
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,439
dead and this is

588
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,679
testing like six different species and

589
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,480
different treatments but

590
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
when we get somewhere around 50 percent

591
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,000
you know

592
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,639
i know my plants can stay alive for a

593
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,798
good six days

594
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,320
and that's what you have to find what

595
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,558
and then you know relative humidity will

596
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,960
always go up in the night a little bit

597
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,359
and but it's the hot days we wanted to

598
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,640
know what care so we know it's even

599
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,798
though you put your plants there and a

600
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
lot of that if you get that

601
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,158
drought period you will lose all your

602
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,520
material

603
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,679
and then

604
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,440
again working in collaboration with

605
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,000
people working on microclimates then we

606
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,640
look at what does the addition of the

607
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,759
stromals compare when you are there pete

608
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,080
and really we ameliorated a lot

609
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,079
our

610
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,038
interface condition between the peat and

611
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,360
the atmosphere

612
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:10,000
and then we started to try different

613
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:12,240
type of mulching we did up to 17

614
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,319
different type

615
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,319
what would be the best and it just

616
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,678
happened that the thrombos which is the

617
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,759
cheapest

618
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,000
and decomposed quickly when you get all

619
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,720
this final that that was the one that

620
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,240
worked really nicely

621
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,519
um

622
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,960
re-wetting

623
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,558
so

624
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,120
we did some uh

625
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,678
try some re-wetting when we just

626
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,479
uh see this is a drain piston here where

627
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,480
the

628
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,960
water table fluctuation this is the

629
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,679
water table would be between

630
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,840
80 centimeter below the surface and and

631
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:50,400
40 and growing to as august gets drier

632
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,480
you know we go down to one meter a

633
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,519
natural piton will also do the same

634
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,400
thing

635
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:59,278
but you know not go so much

636
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,440
lower than 40 centimeter and we know

637
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:04,480
in general we have to keep

638
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,600
around that figure to to have the plants

639
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,599
alive

640
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,119
and then we knew that if we block the

641
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,000
ditches

642
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:15,119
here to try to re-wet is it sufficient

643
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,278
well it is good in the spring but when

644
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:20,399
again you arrive in the drought period

645
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:22,720
in july august we still have a gap that

646
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,919
is too much to keep the plants alive

647
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,839
so

648
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,159
there's action that needs to be there so

649
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,319
to see if you only block the ditches you

650
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,400
don't get your water table back to where

651
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:35,038
you want it and and this is where the

652
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,159
mulch will do the job a combination of

653
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,278
re-wetting and mulching

654
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,320
so

655
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,359
we started to do bonds embankment we did

656
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,000
more

657
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,639
more than just blocking the ditches can

658
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,440
we redistribute the water through the

659
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,080
system through the whole episode

660
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:58,080
so if you look this is a

661
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:00,079
a site that we restore in new brunswick

662
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,558
and there was almost a meter and a half

663
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:05,278
two meters different between this pool

664
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,399
here in the peatland and this road

665
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,278
access

666
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,159
and again your scale this is 30 meters

667
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,359
here

668
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,799
so you see these bonding we did to keep

669
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,519
the water

670
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:20,400
uh to redispute it and see

671
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,720
what he would do and we compare then we

672
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,278
put these

673
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,759
water wells all across it and into the

674
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:30,798
unrestored part just to see where we

675
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:33,119
work hard at into our restoration

676
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:36,158
now follow me because it's a bit it's

677
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,319
easy but it's just we inverted the uh

678
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,640
the legend if we just look at the water

679
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,519
table on the top this is the red is the

680
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,640
restore the natural peatland harvested

681
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,440
pizza

682
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,919
so

683
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,000
and again this is minus i mean 20

684
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,360
centimeter below the paint surface 80

685
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,359
centimeter

686
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,839
and and you see how

687
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,399
uh the restore is actually wetter even

688
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:01,119
in the natural nearby peatland

689
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,400
so which we are really good

690
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,319
in the system

691
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,080
but what is more important for the plant

692
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,359
it's not so much a water table and if

693
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,558
there's a group should know that it's

694
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,000
more you than

695
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:12,319
our psychologist in general is the

696
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,640
tension the water tension

697
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,558
and and we know that

698
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,720
the muscle this kind of muscles you need

699
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,440
to keep it above

700
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,000
uh minus 100 millibar in order that the

701
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,278
cell can have access to the water from

702
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,480
the peat

703
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,240
and

704
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,159
here this is the reverse

705
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,278
from there this is the restore the green

706
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,120
line

707
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,400
and this is the untreated so they own

708
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,599
restore

709
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,080
but just look we know now this is

710
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,759
this is really not good for the

711
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,038
for for the system so if we do a

712
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,879
combination of blocking and

713
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,960
redistributing the water

714
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,320
we keep the spinal that we just

715
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,079
reintroduced

716
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,038
within above that

717
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:55,519
minus 100 millibars so this is this

718
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,599
combination of

719
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:00,480
of these two action that we know works

720
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,719
best for the

721
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,200
now throughout this process

722
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,120
we do some short-term monitoring and

723
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,240
some longer term

724
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,839
because

725
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,000
it's a developing process because we're

726
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,839
doing some small trials to solve a

727
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,880
problem but we're doing some large-scale

728
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,839
one

729
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,640
and and trying to see and how to adapt

730
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,480
so through this loop of monitoring and

731
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,880
this is this is the important

732
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,798
important part if ever any of you get

733
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,600
involved in a

734
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:31,278
restoration ecology

735
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,240
project in an ecological reservation

736
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,000
project

737
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,319
there's need to be a component three and

738
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,798
five years down the line at least

739
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,558
to go back and see if you've you know

740
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,519
what's been done this has been a

741
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:47,319
production of cornell university on the

742
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,319
web at cornell.edu
