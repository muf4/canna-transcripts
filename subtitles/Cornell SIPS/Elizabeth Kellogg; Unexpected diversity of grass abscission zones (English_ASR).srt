1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,780
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,178 --> 00:00:04,779
University

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:17,098
today about diversity between species

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,740
and I'm gonna might echo some of the

5
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:21,210
points that are pointed AVI made earlier

6
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,118
today was to finding that things were

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,070
not working exactly the same in a rabid

8
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:27,899
Optus or perhaps not as well in a rabid

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,230
opposites as they did in tomato hinting

10
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:34,230
that perhaps different species do things

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,450
a little bit differently and so this

12
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,679
this sub subtext of this talk is going

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,690
to be sort of whatever you thought was

14
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,960
happening in one system may or may not

15
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:45,238
be happening in something else so I'll

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,719
be talking specifically about obsessions

17
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:55,049
so I need to define that first and

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:57,829
that's the process of releasing parts

19
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:03,478
from the parent plant thanks falling off

20
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:05,579
so worried yeah

21
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:08,969
so you're most familiar with this in the

22
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:14,968
autumn leaves fall off fall off trees

23
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:18,030
and petals of size the spring of course

24
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:19,319
dandelion fruits of size pretty much all

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,700
the time including when you don't want

26
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:26,129
them to and the most famous story of a

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:31,020
position may be the Apple falling off

28
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:34,590
the tree onto Isaac Newton so in general

29
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:38,728
the location obsession is not random

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,618
it's not simple breaking obsession

31
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:45,899
occurs at a very specific position the

32
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:48,239
obsession zone sorry the obsession zone

33
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,909
which is here from a diagram of the

34
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,280
attrition zone in at the base of a leaf

35
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:58,590
where it attaches to the stem it's this

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,450
little line of very small cells and it

37
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,460
can form at different positions in

38
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,499
different plants so it can be the base

39
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:08,219
of the leaf the base of the pebbles

40
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:11,280
below the fruit below the seed so it's a

41
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,080
so it's something that happens in a lot

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,120
of parts of the plant today I'm going to

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,769
be focusing particularly on obsession

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,769
below the fruit

45
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:27,000
the most familiar obsession zones

46
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:28,899
are in the domesticated cereals so you

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,360
you know this if you've studied

48
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,969
domestication at all in the cereal crops

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,200
such as rice and wheat and all the

50
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:41,289
grasses obsession is set shedding of

51
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:44,348
seeds is called shattering so this one

52
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:46,509
this wild wheat on the Left shatters as

53
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:47,759
it breaks up there's a position in very

54
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:51,729
specific parts of the inflorescence

55
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:54,669
where as the process of domestication is

56
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:56,109
a loss of shattering which was selected

57
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:57,969
unconsciously by humans

58
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,519
notice if you're going out and selecting

59
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:03,848
as this guy is here harvesting with a

60
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:07,860
scythe and then as these women are doing

61
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:09,669
here wrapping the the stalks into shoes

62
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,970
obviously what you're doing is you're

63
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:15,068
selecting for plants in which there's no

64
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:18,009
obsession that as the seeds are on the

65
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:19,988
plant any seeds that are falling off end

66
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:22,959
up in the mud and you don't collect them

67
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:26,769
and so you're automatically selecting

68
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:30,489
for the loss of shattering it probably

69
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:33,159
took quite a while for this set of

70
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:34,930
mutations to get fixed but basically

71
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:38,818
what it means is that all the

72
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:44,439
domesticated cereals are natural mutants

73
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:47,078
in which shattering is lost so mutations

74
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,939
that disable the obsession zone and a

75
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:52,120
lot of what we know about obsession

76
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:54,068
zones come from these wild domesticated

77
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,019
comparisons and I'll be referring to a

78
00:03:54,068 --> 00:04:01,539
number of these through the talk the

79
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,700
other reason why this is important is

80
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:08,530
that there's a lot of focus on improving

81
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:10,988
novel crops that also need to be

82
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,599
selected to reduce or completely

83
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:15,310
eliminate chattering so that I've just

84
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,870
put two here that we're working on right

85
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,298
now I'm not going to be talking about

86
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:23,740
this work in this talk particularly but

87
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:27,788
funny owns a species of digit area which

88
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:31,370
is edible but and as he's grown as a

89
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:34,279
crop in some parts of Africa death

90
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,949
is probably more widely cultivated both

91
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:38,929
of those drop their seeds although

92
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:41,419
toughest sort of holds on to them a

93
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,250
little better than phony and does so

94
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:44,899
that if you're selecting for yield in

95
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,100
these crops if you want to do that to

96
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:48,948
improve them you've got to reduce

97
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,979
shattering first because otherwise if

98
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:53,600
you lose lose the seeds then it doesn't

99
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:56,120
matter how wonderfully nutritious or

100
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,320
large that seed is it's just sitting

101
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,490
there in the mud and you're not going to

102
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,930
get it so it's an it's important a

103
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,050
target for selection and crop

104
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:08,120
improvement just a little bit of

105
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,650
introduction to the grass family I know

106
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,918
it's familiar to many of you here but

107
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:15,739
just to remind you it is a large plant

108
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:20,000
family it's about 12,000 species so

109
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:22,728
about 700 more than 700 genrih then I've

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,009
just put four of them across across the

111
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:28,009
bottom of course the big three are like

112
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:33,949
rice wheat and maize sorghum and millet

113
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:37,038
here and I need to introduce you to just

114
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:40,610
a little bit of grass floral and add me

115
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,319
not much but some the grass flowers are

116
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,439
arranged in little spikes so these

117
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:49,029
little structures known as spikelets so

118
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:51,769
this is a spike layer right here and

119
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:54,069
there it's a series of bracts

120
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:58,579
surrounding a fairly conventional flower

121
00:05:54,069 --> 00:06:01,788
and the motor brats subtend the spikes

122
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:04,250
other two outer brats and then one

123
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:07,129
flower to flowers three flower 4 and so

124
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:10,639
forth these outer Brax

125
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:12,259
know are known as the glooms which is of

126
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,939
course you know when people study

127
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,418
grasses they get depressed about it and

128
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:20,079
it's people call it the gloomy flurry

129
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:23,120
but so to glooms person attending the

130
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:26,000
spikelet and that's that's the bit of

131
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,180
morphology i'll need to refer to for

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,449
this talk so here's another picture this

133
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,610
is switchgrass

134
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,409
there's first gloom second gloom and

135
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,480
then the flowers are above that so the

136
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:43,240
gloom sort of demarcate the bottom of

137
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:45,879
the spikelet in rice the obsessions own

138
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,220
forms above the gloom so the glooms are

139
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,350
these tiny little structures here the

140
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,530
red dotted line marks the obsession zone

141
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:55,390
and then when the spikelet breaks one

142
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:58,299
obsession encourage the glooms stay on

143
00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:00,129
the plant these two little flaps and

144
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,770
then the rest of the flower in the seat

145
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,409
and everything falls off so you can show

146
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:07,509
that in this little diagram were made

147
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,000
the glooms in blue and the obsession

148
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,589
stone is red and their couple in rice a

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,750
couple of sterile flowers and the big

150
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:17,319
fertile flowers shown as this big green

151
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,839
egg like thing if you look at something

152
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:22,029
like bracket podium there's also a

153
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,439
position above the glooms so there's the

154
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:25,449
glooms at the bottom these little blue

155
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,430
things here and then you've got the

156
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,259
multiple flowers in bracket podium and

157
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,500
there's an opposition so in forms

158
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:38,230
between each set of flowers but still

159
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:41,129
above the glooms if we look at something

160
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:44,530
like millet or panicum like switchgrass

161
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:46,569
on the other hand the position is below

162
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:48,309
the gloom so there is a gloom and the

163
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:51,399
thing breaks off the spikelet falls off

164
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,530
entire so there's nothing there no brats

165
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,989
left on the plant so you've got a couple

166
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:59,919
of blooms here and then in a position

167
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,360
zone right below it so in some things

168
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,210
that I've just showed you got a sick

169
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,830
obsession above the glooms and some it's

170
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:11,500
the glooms so how does that sort out

171
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:14,109
across the grass family well in Qing you

172
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,300
who's a postdoc in my lab just

173
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,370
characterized a whole bunch of grasses

174
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,800
based on stuff from the literature of

175
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,509
her own observations and then mapped the

176
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,020
position of the obsession zone onto the

177
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:27,939
grass phylogeny and so blue is the

178
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:29,560
obsession above the glooms that's like

179
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:32,759
rice and braca podium which I just

180
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,590
showed you this race here's Brad podium

181
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:38,229
and that seems to be the ancestral

182
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:40,899
condition and then these things were

183
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,150
there's obsession below the glooms like

184
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,419
seat area is shown here in green and

185
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:48,639
that's a derived condition

186
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:52,240
and then there are a few things that

187
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,698
you're familiar with like tastes taste

188
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,318
dente or wheat in which there's a

189
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:59,528
position actually in the stalk of the

190
00:08:56,318 --> 00:09:00,729
plant that's shown here I'm red but for

191
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:03,129
most of it I'm going to be talking about

192
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,649
today we're just looking at this this

193
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:08,980
simple transition simple transition

194
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:11,220
between below the glooms and above the

195
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,220
glooms

196
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:18,409
so that's the ancestral condition there

197
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,940
so then this raises a really obvious

198
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:22,350
question from the point of view of

199
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,720
genetics and development and the

200
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:29,610
question is is there just a single

201
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,649
obsession so module the the plant sort

202
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,159
of just moves it around depending on

203
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:38,579
where you know where it's it's gonna

204
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:41,519
form it's a single gen module conserved

205
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,170
and then the transcription factor or

206
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,769
something that sort of says oh I'll put

207
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:49,219
it here or put it there then this would

208
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:51,750
be expected this would be a you know one

209
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,220
one possible explanation of the

210
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,830
evolution so this is the question I'm

211
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,600
gonna be talking about today first

212
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,610
starting with simply histology that is

213
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,259
cutting sections right through the

214
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,339
positions of them and see what it looks

215
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:08,909
like moving on to QTL studies in

216
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,130
genome-wide Association studies and to

217
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:13,949
our NAC

218
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:17,610
trying to address this relatively

219
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:19,440
straightforward question so let's start

220
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,360
with it astrology most of what we know

221
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,730
comes from rice there's been a lot of

222
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,300
work on obsession that is shattering

223
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:29,779
interest mm-hmm comparing cultivated

224
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:33,209
rice with its wild shattering relatives

225
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:35,610
and survey in Asia the wild rice which

226
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,250
shatters is a real problem in

227
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,889
agriculture because obviously then it's

228
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:45,149
dropping seeds to produce weeds and get

229
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:49,379
in the field and compete with a crop so

230
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:51,870
if we take a vertical section right down

231
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:53,700
through through here so a longitudinal

232
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,100
section we just slice it down through

233
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,870
and stain it what you get is something

234
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,610
that looks like this and this is we've

235
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,839
done this in my lab these these so these

236
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,339
pictures are from my lab with their

237
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,060
pictures in the literature that are very

238
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:07,980
very similar

239
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:09,629
so the obsession zone the place where

240
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:14,159
things actually break is this little

241
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:17,458
line of cells right here and this I need

242
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:19,699
to introduce you to a few histological

243
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:22,409
stains so you know what the colors mean

244
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,690
so this is stained with saffron and oh

245
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:25,709
and fast green and San Fernando stains

246
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,760
both lignin

247
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:32,009
suberin so the pink indicates Lichtman

248
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,980
lignin and then the obsession zone

249
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:36,629
itself is not lignified so this is the

250
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,220
obsession zone here both sides and this

251
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:41,519
is a vascular strand going down

252
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,430
connecting the the bottom of the

253
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:48,360
spikelet down to the rest of the stock

254
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:50,370
so lignin and no lignin this is another

255
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,070
staying floor boost in all HCl which is

256
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,740
much more specific for just lignin you

257
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,410
get basically the same pattern that the

258
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:02,129
place where it actually breaks is this

259
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:04,889
zone of small thin walled cells so

260
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:06,389
that's fine it's kind of intuitive I

261
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:08,490
just think you have trouble seeing it

262
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:10,528
I've just drawn a squiggly little line

263
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,000
and the squiggles mean nothing other

264
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:19,289
than the fact that I can't draw very

265
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:21,089
well on a mousepad and people have

266
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:22,799
looked at this this is a one paper from

267
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:26,310
the literature looking at the African

268
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:28,649
rice compared to a mutant

269
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:30,299
here's obviously we've now got acridine

270
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,549
orange which is also still standing

271
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:36,120
lignin it's just now green there's the

272
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:39,240
obsession zone and in one of the non

273
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,519
chattering mutants in the domesticate

274
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,190
lignin now extends all the way across

275
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,659
the obsession zone so it just doesn't

276
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,660
doesn't have that breakpoint

277
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:54,779
so that suggests them that a functional

278
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,730
position zone requires a narrow layer of

279
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:01,589
small cells and differential

280
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,330
magnification and this is sort of if you

281
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,800
look up obsession zone in the literature

282
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,660
this is sort of the description you will

283
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,000
get is that it's you've got to have

284
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:11,459
different lignin and then this narrow

285
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,009
layer of small cells defining the break

286
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:19,530
point so that suggested a fairly

287
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:20,909
straightforward set of experiments which

288
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,439
turned out to be really good for summer

289
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:24,929
undergraduate students I highly

290
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,420
recommend anatomy and histology if

291
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:29,579
you've got summer interns because they

292
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:30,870
get to look at something nobody else has

293
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,480
ever looked at before and make a

294
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,929
discovery and produce some pretty

295
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,269
interesting data so raychel Tavares who

296
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:42,000
was an undergrad intern now a grad

297
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:44,549
student at UMass looked at brocco

298
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,559
codeine and this is obsession we call

299
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:47,909
above the blooms so it's right here we

300
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,329
expected it was gonna be just like

301
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:50,399
growths

302
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,700
we're gonna we expected we'd have this

303
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:57,299
same rice type obsession zone in between

304
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,910
the flowers and above the glooms and so

305
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:01,979
raychel looked at bracket podium by

306
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:04,399
stacking on and what she discovered

307
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,960
indeed was this nice little line of

308
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:12,000
small cells right here it very clear um

309
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,990
but if you look at the staining this is

310
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,909
safranin oh so the pink means lignin

311
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:20,460
what you discover is that the the

312
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:25,009
pattern is exactly backwards of what I

313
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:28,560
just saw showed you in rice so here's

314
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:30,389
here's the rice lignin and then the

315
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,899
obsession zone itself is non Lena fide

316
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:36,480
and in bracket podium the obsessions out

317
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,240
itself is heavily lignified and not on

318
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:44,539
either side here's this other more

319
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:47,700
specific latent stain so that was

320
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:49,469
distressing but we thought oh well

321
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:55,410
there's still a nice little line of thin

322
00:14:49,470 --> 00:15:00,029
walled cells so what about obsession

323
00:14:55,409 --> 00:15:01,110
below the glooms what does that look

324
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:04,079
like well this was

325
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,850
studied by John Hodge who was a master

326
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,420
student in the lab he's now a PhD

327
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,310
candidate at Oklahoma State and John got

328
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:14,579
looking at the obsession zone in sight

329
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:17,159
areas seat area V artists which is

330
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:20,460
closely related to switchgrass and phony

331
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,209
oh and he's looking at this region right

332
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,650
at the bottom

333
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:26,150
the obsession zone is right here right

334
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:30,750
below such sectioning right through here

335
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:32,789
and I put this embryo over here this is

336
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,669
a mature grass embryo just to prove to

337
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:37,469
you that this spikelet really is mature

338
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:40,379
it's not that we got the sage wrong

339
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:43,290
there's basically no little line of

340
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:46,500
cells at all we've looked at enough of

341
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:48,000
these I put this dotted line on just to

342
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,490
show you where it breaks we've looked at

343
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,149
enough to know that's where it happens

344
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:56,850
but you're not seeing any clearly

345
00:15:54,149 --> 00:16:00,299
differentiated abscission zone at all

346
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:03,269
and if you stain it with these like

347
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:06,779
safranin oh here's the lignin it's just

348
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:08,309
around the outside and I put bright

349
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,689
podium next to it just so you can see

350
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:11,639
the comparison there's the podium

351
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:15,150
position zone which remembers the

352
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,740
inverse of the rice and even if you

353
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:18,720
stain it with a gritty and orange

354
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,370
it's not just the stain there's the

355
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,960
lignin out here and there's lignin of

356
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,860
course in the vasculature but there is

357
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:28,710
it this thing breaks right here so there

358
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,860
is no cellular differentiation this is

359
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:34,350
stained with taffy which lets you know

360
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,500
where the nuclei are and points out live

361
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:42,750
cells the cells are live right through

362
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:44,789
there so nothing's dying um and I don't

363
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,379
want to spend too much time on this one

364
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:48,000
point but we we've done a number of

365
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:51,090
other approaches we still can't figure

366
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:57,539
out what it is that marks the obsession

367
00:16:51,090 --> 00:17:00,840
zone in this particular species so just

368
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:03,379
to summarize the histology histological

369
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,269
comparisons of among these three species

370
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:07,709
in rice America podium yeah we've got

371
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:08,910
this canonical position zone where the

372
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,620
obsession zone cells are slightly

373
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,709
significantly smaller than the

374
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,639
surrounding cells seat area once you

375
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:17,808
know where to look

376
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,900
they are slightly smaller but not

377
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:23,578
compelling so differential ignition

378
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,390
definitely in rice and broccoli but not

379
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:31,529
sat area and the decision zone itself

380
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:37,530
not lignified in Rice's Terrier but not

381
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:41,339
recommended so we're not seeing a lot of

382
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:43,259
conservation so we then tried to rescue

383
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:45,779
that with another hypothesis and said

384
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:48,240
well maybe you know each one of these

385
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:50,210
things is in a different clade and at

386
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,769
least it's representative of the clade

387
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,450
so that everything was related to seat

388
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:58,230
area we'll have a seat area obsession

389
00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:02,460
zone and bracket podium so forth and so

390
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:04,970
our undergraduate intern last summer was

391
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:09,058
Patricia Leyva

392
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:10,950
who decided to get serious about this

393
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:12,690
and we said fine just section everything

394
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,190
you can get hold of well it turned out

395
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,870
everything she can have to hold up and

396
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,740
she could get through in a short period

397
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:21,298
of time was an enormous amount so it's

398
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,919
all these species that are up here that

399
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:24,089
she's actually looked at and I'm not

400
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:31,890
gonna walk you through every single

401
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:33,659
species they're just all different you

402
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,070
know this one does this there's the

403
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,190
obsession zone it's not liquefied at all

404
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:39,918
either side and that's Brett Bodine

405
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,798
which you've already seen this is teff

406
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:51,290
over here and teff actually breaks right

407
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:51,289
there so yeah they're all different

408
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,920
and to figure out whether that track

409
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:59,990
with phylogeny she she simply if she

410
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,019
mapped all these characters on to a

411
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:07,480
pruned grass phylogeny and if you just

412
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:10,940
look at the position that's coded as

413
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:15,890
basically one is above the glooms and

414
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:18,950
two is below the glooms and that isn't

415
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,990
consistent with in any and doesn't match

416
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,799
the phylogeny in terms of having the

417
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:26,839
tiny little cells one is having small

418
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,369
cells and two is not having a set of

419
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:35,119
small cells that doesn't match in' and D

420
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:36,979
is the cell wall pattern so green means

421
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,639
not like a fine and pink means is the

422
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:44,799
color of the stain meaning lignin and

423
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:51,890
that doesn't track the phylogeny at all

424
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:54,889
so in terms of the question we're trying

425
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:57,880
to answer if we look at his knowledge II

426
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:00,710
the answer is no there is no

427
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:07,990
conservation in the structure or the

428
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:10,250
obsession zone so that was not great but

429
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,019
you start thinking well maybe there's

430
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,829
there's some underlying genetic

431
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:17,119
conservation even though there's even

432
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:21,079
there there's no histological

433
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:25,849
transposition and RNA see so let's look

434
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:27,199
at QTL studies and it certainly they've

435
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,339
been a lot of them particularly in rice

436
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,580
as i mentioned they've identified

437
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:34,879
several genes that control the obsession

438
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:37,460
zone and a few years ago our colleague

439
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,550
Andrew gauss wrote a review paper in the

440
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,309
american journal of botany where took

441
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:45,799
the rice chromosomes and put on them

442
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:49,549
just the location of the QTL from all

443
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:53,470
the published studies up to that point

444
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:56,329
QTL are here in these black boxes and

445
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,519
you know they the genes are listed under

446
00:20:56,329 --> 00:21:00,769
here it will not be mentioning too many

447
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:02,450
of the gene names today but you know

448
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:04,819
they've been well localized and some of

449
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,330
the genes in the cloned and the question

450
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:06,859
is in

451
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:09,889
what does it look like when you put

452
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:15,199
other species on here so red is is Xia

453
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:18,380
and green is sorghum brown a seat area

454
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,029
and what you see just by looking at how

455
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,150
the colors line up is in fact there's

456
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:27,529
not much overlap expect in this one

457
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:29,990
region here so a lot of stuff that seems

458
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:32,289
to be unique to rice a lot of stuff

459
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:35,630
that's unique to the other species

460
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:38,359
possibly some similarity and that region

461
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,990
of similarity seems to all cover this

462
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,209
one

463
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,210
gabi transcription factor which is known

464
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:50,390
as shattering one which was originally

465
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:58,160
identified in a sort of cross as shown

466
00:21:50,390 --> 00:22:00,410
here so I be mentioning focusing on this

467
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,960
is one if you can hang on to this name

468
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,690
the yabby genes shattering one that is

469
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:12,829
shared across a lot of different species

470
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:14,680
in these QTL studies so that raises a

471
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:18,159
question about natural variation

472
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:20,840
remember I started out by saying our

473
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,650
ancestors who domesticated all the

474
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:28,329
cereals we're selecting unconsciously

475
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:32,509
from standing variation in wild clans

476
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:35,119
and if that was gonna work I mean we

477
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:37,220
know it did work there have to be non

478
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:41,779
shattering mutations that are relatively

479
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:43,279
common in that in wild populations if

480
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:44,269
there aren't it if the mutations aren't

481
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,649
bigger than it doesn't matter how much

482
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:49,839
you select on I mean you don't get

483
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:52,190
anywhere with it but nobody's actually

484
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,649
surveyed a very larger set of a wild

485
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:57,680
germ plasm for reduced shattering and

486
00:22:54,650 --> 00:23:00,830
then gone on to clone a gene so I'm

487
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:06,350
going to tell you about doing that now

488
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:08,059
because we've did that and the the clamp

489
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:11,449
that we looked at was green millet which

490
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:14,179
is Citterio be reduced and it's shown

491
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,559
here growing in its natural habitat in

492
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,900
the United States which is right next

493
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:18,720
door

494
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:24,210
wait you can see the tarmac over there

495
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,640
it's a very Reedy plant and we collected

496
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:31,259
it pretty widely throughout the US and

497
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,600
got hold of some material outside of the

498
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:36,390
US it's a small diploid plant it's been

499
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,949
being used as a model for a number of

500
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,009
things particularly for studies in c4

501
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:42,809
photosynthesis because it's small its

502
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:46,109
diploid its rapid cycling it can be

503
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:50,819
transformed so so quite a few labs are

504
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:52,709
using that using this as as a model and

505
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:55,759
then quite recently we've been involved

506
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:59,600
we I should say is actually folks at JDI

507
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:04,920
so this group led by Germans have

508
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:06,419
produced a new assembly of a reference

509
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,220
line so there was an old version and

510
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:13,650
this is a an updated much much better

511
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:16,019
version line known as a ten-time a

512
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:19,019
mentioned during this talk a bit I'll

513
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,859
try not to this so it's a really nice

514
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:25,529
assembly

515
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:28,019
it's basically all nine chromosomes and

516
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:31,319
relatively small number of contacts with

517
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:33,509
a real good and 50 so we have this

518
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:41,359
really lovely assembly and as part of

519
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:44,849
that project we also collected and see

520
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,669
598 diverse lines from particularly from

521
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:49,049
the US and Canada as well as elsewhere

522
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:51,870
and I'm putting this map up here for a

523
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:54,240
couple of reasons one is when you're

524
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:57,029
working on national diversity in most

525
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,759
cases you don't have a gene bank to go

526
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:05,009
to if you want to you go get it

527
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:07,970
so that's what we did the yellow dots

528
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:12,150
are trips that well I did that one

529
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:14,009
people from my lab made over a period of

530
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:17,580
several years max Feldman from Ivan

531
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:21,089
Baxter just loved blue loops and then

532
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:22,649
green and red was from Huang this

533
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:24,179
macfoster shouldn't show something else

534
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:27,990
and that is of course that st. Louis is

535
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:31,529
the center of the universe sorry

536
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:33,120
and also that seat area emeritus is very

537
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:38,279
way Tweety and grows really well along

538
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:41,069
interstate highways one one of the

539
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:43,049
people from formerly from my lab I do

540
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:45,119
need to give a shout out to is a guy

541
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:49,319
named Matt estep who's now at

542
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:51,629
Appalachian State and he did the

543
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:53,700
collecting all the way up to here and

544
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,650
there is another one of the reference

545
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,650
lines that I'll probably mention at

546
00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:00,840
least once called Hemi Oh 34 that is

547
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:05,700
very widely used now in the Emmy stands

548
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:11,459
for Mattie step so that's so his his

549
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:18,390
line is becoming very widely used and so

550
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:21,090
the jdi's sequenced sequence libraries

551
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,650
for each of these things covered to very

552
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:28,889
high coverage each one has been

553
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:30,840
assembled to know them and I've got a

554
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:34,290
lot of snips did a lot of

555
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:36,709
presence/absence variation 98% of the

556
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:40,740
genes are shared among all the species

557
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:43,279
and there's done a bunch of Adam Healy

558
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,200
and sue John my meaty at the jgi

559
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:49,109
HudsonAlpha have done a lot of

560
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,390
population genetics on this which I'm

561
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:54,439
only just gonna mention more and passing

562
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:56,880
for this talk but there's a lot there

563
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,500
population genetic analysis shows four

564
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,870
major introductions from the old world

565
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,880
so there's a stuff in pink

566
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:07,099
we're calling the central population and

567
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:10,890
that is genetically very similar to

568
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:15,509
material from China the blue is very

569
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:18,990
similar to things from southern Europe

570
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:20,700
and Turkey sort of Caucasus green

571
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,920
there's the northern population which

572
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,269
also extends across Eurasia and then

573
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,950
there's the orange in the west coast

574
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:31,769
population which is also parts of the

575
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:36,930
Western Asia so a lot of introductions

576
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:39,569
from the old world and who Wang was not

577
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:42,060
BASF phenotype this sub

578
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:44,490
these lines about 200 of them and assess

579
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:45,899
them for shattering so there's here's a

580
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,180
bunch of plants over here and you can

581
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,670
see there's a big pile of seeds

582
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:53,250
spikelets that are falling off obviously

583
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:55,950
very high shattering pile of pilot

584
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:57,839
plants and from that he did a

585
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:02,090
genome-wide Association analysis which

586
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:06,059
identified a single peak right here

587
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:07,980
covering a pretty large QTL but it

588
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:10,500
didn't cover any previously known and

589
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,890
shattering locusts so none of the stuff

590
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,349
from rice what he did find was he

591
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:19,830
managed by various combinations of tests

592
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:23,459
as a causal gene which we're calling

593
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:24,960
less shattering one just because the

594
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,950
reduces shattering it doesn't completely

595
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,900
abolish it it's an uncharacterized nib

596
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:33,360
so there's a harsh shattering line which

597
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,830
happens to be like ma 34 and there's a

598
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,789
low shattering line which is the

599
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:41,369
reference in which there's a mutation

600
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:44,869
that causes a non-conservative amino

601
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:50,279
acid substitution so to validate that

602
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:54,269
this was not done with CRISPR so here's

603
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:57,029
the wild-type allele over here

604
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:59,940
fre shattering and then the CRISPR line

605
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:01,700
is substantially less shattering you

606
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,809
know once again it's not a complete

607
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:08,220
abolishment of shattering but it's a lot

608
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:10,829
less and we validated that by measuring

609
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,100
the strength of the obsession zone which

610
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:16,109
is that's a technique that's used

611
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:19,889
frequently in this approach where you

612
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:22,079
take the inflorescence and hang it

613
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,940
upside down on the force gauge and then

614
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,129
grab one spike with a pair of tweezers

615
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:29,100
and pull

616
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:30,690
and the force required braking force

617
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:33,329
required for the position zone turns up

618
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:36,029
on the force gauge this is a very boring

619
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:38,189
experiment but it gives you pretty good

620
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:40,819
data which is shown here so here's the

621
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,830
tensile strength of the obsession zone

622
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:45,809
the high shattering wild-type this is

623
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:48,509
any 34 shown in red and you can see

624
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:51,000
after did about 18 days after heading

625
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:54,990
it's dropped close to zero the slightly

626
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,960
lower shattering while the wheel does

627
00:29:54,990 --> 00:30:01,170
shatter but later and then the crisper

628
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,650
lung the tensile strength stays very

629
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:06,210
high so change over development

630
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:10,590
validated that and then we also found

631
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:12,299
that the domesticated version of green

632
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:14,069
millet which is Fausto Mullins so this

633
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:17,549
is the wild one this is the domestic it

634
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:21,269
actually has a transposon in less form

635
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:25,309
that appears to disable it so it seems

636
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:28,529
to be a gene that has contributed to

637
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:30,089
domestication obviously can't be the

638
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:36,329
whole story because it's not a complete

639
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:38,129
non shattering phenotype so then let's

640
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:40,019
just then go back to some QTL studies

641
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,940
that have been done by colleagues and

642
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:43,740
have also published and question is does

643
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,660
it fall under any known uto for

644
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:49,980
shattering that is is a domestication

645
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:53,070
gene so here's a QTL map of shattering

646
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,829
from an RI line that was made in Andrew

647
00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:59,460
dowsed made and has developed in his lab

648
00:30:55,829 --> 00:31:03,599
between a wild deteriorate as' and the

649
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:05,400
cultivated foxtail millet sh-1 which I

650
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,009
mentioned to you earlier the one that

651
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:15,390
comes up in all the other QTL studies is

652
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:17,609
we're right and the question is just

653
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:21,509
less one follow fall under this

654
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:25,559
chromosome five and no it doesn't that's

655
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:30,869
not less one less one is actually over

656
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:35,099
here so what we're thinking our thinking

657
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:38,459
right now is that the transposon unless

658
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:38,949
one probably reduced shattering and they

659
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,230
have

660
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,269
in early involved in early domestication

661
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:46,659
but then subsequent much stronger

662
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:49,480
mutations were involved in actually

663
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:53,919
producing this completely non chattering

664
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,470
domestic so just to summarize the seat

665
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,139
area genome-wide Association studies

666
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:02,230
we've got a high quality genome a lot of

667
00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:06,428
wild diversity a lot of good population

668
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:09,099
genetics and then use G wast from that

669
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:12,249
to I find a novel domestication locus

670
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:15,579
which was validated with CRISPR and

671
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:19,319
obviously pretty produces a resource for

672
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:19,319
other exploring other traits

673
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:27,349
what this does is it adds a species

674
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:29,810
specific gene to the list of genes from

675
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:34,369
other species and other QTL studies so

676
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:35,990
just talk about less one and these other

677
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,459
ones again I'm not going to go through

678
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,529
them in detail but what you'll see is

679
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,410
that they're each one this is a rice

680
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:44,720
flan this seems to be specifically rice

681
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:47,330
this is rice these guys are true kisi

682
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,289
ate only that's wheat and barley and

683
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:56,389
only sh-1 seems to be in multiple

684
00:32:51,289 --> 00:33:00,139
species so what we're seeing is then is

685
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:03,500
that from these cutie on and gos studies

686
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:07,550
the controls of obsession appear to vary

687
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:09,650
among species however this kind of work

688
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:14,210
is not designed to get you the whole

689
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:15,769
network and so it's quite possible that

690
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,970
there is indeed if conserved Network

691
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:18,950
that's moved around the plant which is

692
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,180
where we started first but we've just

693
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:24,830
found a whole lot of different ways to

694
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:26,330
break it and you know so we say it's

695
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:32,629
less one involved in chattering and

696
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:38,210
other species and and we'll come back to

697
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:41,920
that but don't is from based on getting

698
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:44,210
back to our original original question

699
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:49,840
from the question of the histology

700
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:51,309
there's no conservation from QT OMG was

701
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:56,899
inconclusive

702
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:58,909
maybe shattering one so obviously what's

703
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,310
the thing to do things to RNA seek and

704
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:04,519
so this was a collaboration led by in

705
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:10,699
Chengdu in my lab and with Hao who an

706
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:13,398
eiderdown oklahoma state and remember

707
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:15,199
that we have rice breaking above the

708
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:16,789
glooms bracket podium between the

709
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,168
flowers and seat area

710
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:23,719
the obsession zone below the glooms so

711
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:27,049
what you interesting did was dissected

712
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:29,089
out the region of the obsession zone for

713
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,010
each of those three species so you've

714
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:32,358
seen all these so far so here's the

715
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,819
obsession zone

716
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:37,699
second out the regions roughly with this

717
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:40,818
orange box and then as a sort of

718
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:43,578
internal troll she looked at the area

719
00:34:40,818 --> 00:34:45,739
right below the lower region and the

720
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:50,419
area right above that is the upper

721
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:51,829
region and so could look compare the

722
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:54,168
genes that were expressed in the

723
00:34:51,829 --> 00:35:00,619
exertion zone to the ones above and

724
00:34:54,168 --> 00:35:02,808
below and this Venn diagram simply shows

725
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:04,130
that the set of one to one orthologues

726
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:07,369
is largely the same

727
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:09,739
I'm almost be she's so that because the

728
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:16,119
seven genes that are expressed in that

729
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:18,349
region is shared so then the question is

730
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:20,269
alright which one's of those are

731
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:23,088
specifically restricted to the obsession

732
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:27,709
zone and she did it a bunch of different

733
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:30,440
analyses inching and how a lot this I'm

734
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:34,068
just showing you the results of WGC na

735
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:38,389
and just to walk you through this this

736
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:40,940
diagram here what we have is a heat map

737
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:44,028
of expression levels these have three

738
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:46,039
replicates for below the glooms three

739
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:48,318
replicates within the obsession zone and

740
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:50,569
three replicates above the obsession

741
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:53,179
zone this is at the young developmental

742
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:56,329
stage and then the same set of

743
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:58,038
replicates below the obsession zone and

744
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:01,999
above the obsession zone had an old

745
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:05,150
developmental stage and for this

746
00:36:01,998 --> 00:36:08,598
particular cluster in rice there are

747
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:10,880
about 3,000 genes that are clearly

748
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:13,160
distinguishing the young stage from the

749
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:18,170
old stage they're up at the young stage

750
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:20,239
they're down at the old stage and each

751
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:23,210
species has modules that look like that

752
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:25,039
and they overlap significantly so

753
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:29,059
there's the 3,000 ones I just showed you

754
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:32,630
in rice there are about 2200 in bracket

755
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:35,539
podium and the overlap among those is

756
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:40,068
about 850 genes that are differentially

757
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:42,980
expressed shared between them highly

758
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:44,599
significant overlap suggesting there's a

759
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,480
lot of similarity in terms of the

760
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:49,278
developmental stages but of course what

761
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,498
we want to know is what's happening with

762
00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:55,730
the obsession zone itself so here's a

763
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:57,469
rice set the genes that are highly

764
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:59,869
expressed in the obsession zone at the

765
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:01,909
young developmental stage how much

766
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:05,749
higher any obsession zone then either

767
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:09,379
below or above and again every species

768
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:11,598
has a couple of positions done specific

769
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:17,180
knowledge about particular developmental

770
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:21,980
stages so the question then the imaging

771
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:24,528
and how asked was toward what's shared

772
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:27,019
among these that here's where I guess

773
00:37:24,528 --> 00:37:28,190
there's a set of 962 here's bracket

774
00:37:27,018 --> 00:37:31,239
podium there's 100

775
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:34,849
what is shared between those modules and

776
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:37,809
the answer is basically nothing there's

777
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:40,338
a little bit of overlap which is barely

778
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:45,380
statistically significant given the

779
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:48,500
number of comparisons very low numbers

780
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:51,260
and of course what we really want is

781
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,960
this three-way overlap and there are

782
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,760
three genes so there's a mid there's a

783
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,510
lysine decarboxylase about which we know

784
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,859
nothing and Akuma rate ligase which is

785
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:05,150
presumably involved in lignin formation

786
00:38:02,858 --> 00:38:07,190
so our first thought was well maybe we

787
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:09,980
just messed up the analysis maybe we

788
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:12,200
should be considering analyzing things

789
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:14,179
slightly differently in terms of which

790
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:17,929
genes we included in how we did the

791
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:21,500
comparison we did they're completely

792
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:24,230
different analysis and we got exactly

793
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,579
the same result in fact the second

794
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,199
analysis we only got two things

795
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:30,200
overlapping although they were two of

796
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:32,568
the same ones we saw in the first one so

797
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:35,509
here's the mid highly expressed in the

798
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:38,420
obsession zone at a young stage and the

799
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:40,960
lysine Dyer decarboxylase also among all

800
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,960
three species

801
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:51,350
there's the expression domain of this

802
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:53,869
myth is in the obsession zone so that's

803
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:55,849
good in two of the species couldn't pick

804
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:58,519
it up in seat area which either means

805
00:38:55,849 --> 00:39:02,299
that the RNA seek is misleading or this

806
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:06,170
method in situ is is not sensitive

807
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:07,760
enough you might be thinking about what

808
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,260
happened to less one and the answer is

809
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,850
it wasn't in this analysis at all

810
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:15,020
because it was not differentially

811
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:16,460
expressed in anything not in seat area

812
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:19,009
beer it is very low level of expression

813
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:21,820
in rice and not expressed at all in

814
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,820
bracket odium

815
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,680
so again it's not only species-specific

816
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:31,049
whatever it's doing is probably not

817
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:33,449
specific to the obsession zone and the

818
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:36,260
effect on shattering may be a byproduct

819
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:36,259
of something else

820
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:42,820
if we go back to the known genes the

821
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:45,440
genes that have been known in rice

822
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,880
there's these are ones that have been

823
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,970
identified in the literature and their

824
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,490
obsessions own specific and rice but if

825
00:39:49,969 --> 00:39:54,829
you look at those same genes in the

826
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:59,269
obsession modules as to where they fall

827
00:39:54,829 --> 00:40:00,650
in the other species like this again

828
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:06,800
they're not always even in an obsession

829
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:08,389
module in the other species thinking

830
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,789
that perhaps we needed to look earlier

831
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:13,579
in development it's entering did a lot

832
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:16,400
of in situ hybridization at earlier

833
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:18,590
stages says all this stage of in situ

834
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,240
hybridization was the youngest stage

835
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:23,210
from the RNA see you can see very

836
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:26,779
clearly gene expression this happens to

837
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:29,300
be a petal of two and you can see it at

838
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,100
the earlier stage so this is rice again

839
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,800
this is confirming and published data

840
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:38,389
and then if we look at the other two

841
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:40,250
species there's no expression there let

842
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:42,829
me put them that's where the obsession

843
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:45,739
zone is and what you can see is that

844
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:47,869
they're really just it's not simply not

845
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:50,349
expressed in the obsession zone and the

846
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:50,349
other species

847
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:56,609
same thing for other things so if we get

848
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,550
back then to the question that we

849
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:02,190
started with is the obsessions aren't

850
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:04,110
conserved by a developmental controlled

851
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:08,639
by conserve developmental module

852
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:15,240
the answer is histologically no the QT l

853
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:18,440
is inconclusive may EBS h1 and RNA seek

854
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,439
points to only two genes

855
00:41:19,588 --> 00:41:27,179
um looking at sh1 it's muted a

856
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:29,400
desiccated cereals we don't know as with

857
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:32,608
everything else we don't know what any

858
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:37,619
of these things do here's SH one insight

859
00:41:32,608 --> 00:41:40,440
ooze but the gene networks differ among

860
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:42,509
species so although maybe a conserved

861
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:47,749
component of the network its specific

862
00:41:42,509 --> 00:41:47,748
role may be different between species

863
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:54,220
so the overall answer the question is no

864
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:59,019
the set of genes involved in a

865
00:41:54,219 --> 00:42:01,268
prostitution zone is largely shared but

866
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:06,338
how they are deployed is mostly

867
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:10,868
different the practical implications of

868
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:12,759
this are mean that for improving the

869
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:16,059
orphan crops remember I talked about

870
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:18,039
Antonio right at the beginning or novel

871
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:20,440
crops things like no perennial wheat

872
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:23,289
grass for any of that improvement cannot

873
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:27,249
proceed without reducing shattering if

874
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:30,069
these networks are species specific we

875
00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:34,808
need to study each crop individually as

876
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:38,920
to how it actually is put together sh1

877
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:41,140
mid 26 may be exceptions and we're

878
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,930
certainly pursuing looking at those to

879
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:48,368
see how they are deployed particularly

880
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:50,828
in tough Antonio and the other thing

881
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:54,548
that we're pursuing is exactly how they

882
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:57,670
work because at the cell level is not

883
00:42:54,548 --> 00:43:00,278
known in general we're thinking that

884
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:02,259
most the genes that are necessary for a

885
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:03,789
position are probably establishing

886
00:43:02,259 --> 00:43:06,639
development of the spikelet and a

887
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:11,220
pedestal rather than controlling

888
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:14,650
obsession per se that is if you affect

889
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:16,629
spikelet development or pedicel

890
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,838
development it's going to have an effect

891
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:23,619
on the obsessions own sort of indirectly

892
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:26,338
and the obsessions on itself may be

893
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:28,838
controlled by only a handful of genes or

894
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:32,619
may be deployed only at the very last

895
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:36,639
minute before obsession or it may not be

896
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:40,568
transcriptionally regulated so with that

897
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:42,009
I'm gonna stop and thank the team

898
00:43:40,568 --> 00:43:43,960
particularly at HudsonAlpha

899
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:46,599
the people who did a lot of the work on

900
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:49,929
the seat area genome and all the

901
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:51,940
diversity work and the GOS studies great

902
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:55,268
bunch of people who work with and then

903
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:57,068
this is my lab at the Danforth Plant

904
00:43:55,268 --> 00:43:59,379
Science Center most everything most of

905
00:43:57,068 --> 00:44:02,429
what I talked about today was work

906
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:06,720
inching you and yes that is the Stanley

907
00:44:02,429 --> 00:44:08,579
so um like to thank you for all your

908
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,079
attention and thanks again to the

909
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,739
organizers for putting together a great

910
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,739
symposium

911
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:18,659
thank you so much Toby that was a really

912
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:21,360
interesting talk and I see you already

913
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:24,299
have a few questions in the chat it

914
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,550
looks like the first one was from Hannah

915
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:30,840
Jeffery you want to unmute yourself and

916
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:33,300
ask that one yes thank you I was

917
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:35,250
interested in that map that you had

918
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:38,010
shown earlier and I realize literally

919
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:41,489
basic question from some perspectives

920
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:44,420
but I was thinking about it in terms of

921
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:44,419
ecology

922
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:57,518
well I think Hannah just disappeared

923
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:59,470
I'm fine okay it's very loud very I'm I

924
00:44:57,518 --> 00:45:03,159
was thinking about it from an ecological

925
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:06,308
point of view and I was wondering do you

926
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:08,768
think that maybe you could find more

927
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:10,900
homologs to important genes near the

928
00:45:08,768 --> 00:45:23,949
Illinois area where a lot of the species

929
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:29,710
seem to radiate out from looked at the

930
00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:33,278
whole array because there's there's not

931
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:41,710
only been a lot of introduction a lot of

932
00:45:33,278 --> 00:45:44,259
the introductions seem to that would be

933
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:47,470
an interesting place to look at more

934
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:51,909
closely specifically look at the the

935
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:54,038
admix lines in particular well that

936
00:45:51,909 --> 00:45:57,690
isn't that is variant that is very cool

937
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:59,950
to to see that perhaps there would be

938
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:02,440
something unique that would have popped

939
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:09,699
up later on as opposed to a closer to

940
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:14,559
the epicenter so the one thing is the to

941
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:17,018
kinda be the epicenter is hardly driven

942
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:20,798
by by the introduction history of this

943
00:46:17,018 --> 00:46:24,929
thing we don't have a real good picture

944
00:46:20,798 --> 00:46:28,630
of the diversification across Eurasia

945
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:30,788
the sapling is just super sparks there

946
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:32,230
and I think your question probably would

947
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:35,890
be would be really interesting to

948
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:40,690
address closer to where that is actually

949
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:44,259
meeting and that we actually seeing

950
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:47,559
better signature ecological interactions

951
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:49,389
yeah it's a really good question I agree

952
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:53,859
thank you thanks huh

953
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:59,049
no problem looks like we have another

954
00:46:53,858 --> 00:47:02,199
question from Ln he's a bit

955
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:04,690
hi hi do you plan to automate your

956
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:06,599
tensile experiments in the future

957
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:10,090
because that's really cool work but

958
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:14,219
someone pulling it by hand may affect

959
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:18,070
the quality of results yes it also

960
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:22,959
affects the enthusiasm of the person

961
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:25,330
doing the pulling it's yeah it's not a

962
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:29,880
great experiment we've tried to we've

963
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:34,000
tried other assays we have other ways of

964
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:37,210
estimating kind of how many seeds fall

965
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,179
off you're counting seeds or weighing

966
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:42,179
them and that sort of thing the tensile

967
00:47:40,179 --> 00:47:45,750
strength is very nice and and

968
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:48,519
quantitative and yeah if we had a way to

969
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:52,539
do that more easily it certainly would

970
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:55,090
be would be good but I haven't been able

971
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:58,230
to come up with the challenging part is

972
00:47:55,090 --> 00:48:01,269
simply getting old and spiked work and

973
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:04,269
you know if there was a way to grab it

974
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:05,889
in some some good way it would be it

975
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:11,980
would be great so yeah if you have any

976
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:16,449
ideas okay thank you

977
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:17,949
Thanks and then it looks like there's a

978
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:22,089
question from stephen maryk

979
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:23,819
oh yes I was wondering about if you

980
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:26,800
looked at any of the micro rna's or

981
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:29,920
small RNAs in the abscission zone region

982
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,810
and they have any homology to the Navy

983
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:39,809
they identified differentially expressed

984
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:42,610
genes yeah sorry what were their utrs

985
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:44,769
so that's a really good question and

986
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:47,079
it's something we've sought them out and

987
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:50,559
just haven't made the libraries to do

988
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:53,769
the sequencing but it's as we're going

989
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:56,860
forward we are almost certainly going to

990
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:58,750
be doing that a little of two genes

991
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:03,160
which do come up and some of these

992
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:04,360
species are regulated by micro rna's so

993
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:06,159
yeah I guess the answer to your question

994
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:11,650
is no we haven't done it but yes we'd

995
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:15,339
love to and we'll be Thanks yeah

996
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:19,300
and we also have a question from Jim

997
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:19,750
Holland oh hi hi Toby that was a great

998
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,440
talk

999
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:25,449
um I was wondering about looking at

1000
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,510
general where there's variation within

1001
00:49:25,449 --> 00:49:31,419
the genus for where the shattering

1002
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:35,020
occurs and my recollection was in a

1003
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:36,880
novena that different species will

1004
00:49:35,019 --> 00:49:38,380
shatter at different places in the

1005
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:43,380
floral structure so I'm wondering if

1006
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:46,269
looked at cases like that we have not

1007
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,880
certainly with vena that you're right

1008
00:49:46,269 --> 00:49:51,309
there's different you know different

1009
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,349
cultivated lines and different species

1010
00:49:51,309 --> 00:49:56,230
do break up in different ways and that's

1011
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:58,989
also true with the the weak relative

1012
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:01,480
wheat and barley relatives they you know

1013
00:49:58,989 --> 00:50:03,939
they just break in different places I

1014
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,079
think we had gone into this assuming

1015
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:07,389
there was just going to be a comp

1016
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:10,690
completely conserved network and so we

1017
00:50:07,389 --> 00:50:14,589
hadn't really dug into the the within

1018
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:17,170
species diversity but given what we know

1019
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:19,829
now that might be might definitely be

1020
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:19,829
worth pursuing

1021
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:31,250
Jeff Doyle you want to go ahead and ask

1022
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:31,250
your question

1023
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,469
yeah

1024
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:38,840
Toby nice talk is is cell death involved

1025
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:43,849
an incision

1026
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:49,730
you know the literature is ambiguous and

1027
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:49,730
if it isn't involved it's pretty late

1028
00:50:50,300 --> 00:51:00,440
some people some species in litchi where

1029
00:50:57,469 --> 00:51:04,949
obsession of one cell layer from another

1030
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:08,700
involves cell death but in in the cereal

1031
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:09,869
crops the assumption which i think

1032
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:11,519
hasn't been very well tested the

1033
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:14,400
assumption is that it's an active

1034
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:16,309
process that is the cells right there

1035
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,950
the obsessions ona actually secrete

1036
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:21,599
cellulases and pectin aces out dissolves

1037
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:26,819
a cell wall and they can't obviously do

1038
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:30,929
that if it unless they're alive so it

1039
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:35,070
may not you know so that may not be

1040
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:38,519
involved the exception may be intense is

1041
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:41,460
the place where tough breaks it actually

1042
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:46,380
looks like those cells just fall apart

1043
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:47,730
becomes necrotic or something so yeah I

1044
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,340
guess the answer to your question is we

1045
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:52,469
don't know yeah I was just thinking that

1046
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:54,600
maybe that would be something a process

1047
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:55,889
that would be you know sort of difficult

1048
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:59,130
to detect by any of the histological

1049
00:51:55,889 --> 00:52:01,109
methods or RNA seek but could account

1050
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:03,180
for some program in there that would

1051
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:06,390
actually cause a group of cells to die

1052
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:10,139
and and create that that breakpoint yeah

1053
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:13,199
yeah in it and then that may actually be

1054
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:15,210
a good possibility and one of the

1055
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:18,569
challenges of this is once you start

1056
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:21,599
focusing on things like the actual

1057
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:27,090
breaking process itself it's hard to

1058
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:29,190
study because the things break things

1059
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:31,620
just fall apart on you as you're trying

1060
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:34,880
to work with them but yeah no I think

1061
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:37,880
that's a really really good possibility

1062
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,880
Thanks

1063
00:52:39,139 --> 00:52:47,250
and we have also a question from Chelsea

1064
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:50,400
Specht yeah Toby thank you that was a

1065
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:52,259
fantastic talk I just I was also

1066
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,269
thinking like Jeff about about program

1067
00:52:52,259 --> 00:52:56,278
cell death and also going back in my

1068
00:52:54,268 --> 00:52:57,750
head as what are the processes to study

1069
00:52:56,278 --> 00:52:59,880
that I know a lot of it was with

1070
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:02,190
nectaries where things start to degrade

1071
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:05,009
and then you get the secretion but with

1072
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:07,170
a abscission zone it's different in that

1073
00:53:05,009 --> 00:53:10,440
you don't get that cellular secretion

1074
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:12,599
along with the death you actually get I

1075
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,588
don't know you were just saying the

1076
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:17,910
cells kind of break apart or just or

1077
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:21,000
they lose their cell walls right they

1078
00:53:17,909 --> 00:53:24,358
they kind of dry up I guess I like a

1079
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,210
better word but I was thinking about the

1080
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:29,699
signaling if there's any way that to

1081
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:32,519
detect some kind of I don't know if it

1082
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:34,048
would be signaling or hormone or some

1083
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:36,149
sort of small molecule that might be

1084
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:39,119
involved with setting up a particular

1085
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:42,269
zone where the cells then are no longer

1086
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:47,369
involved in growth but rather somehow

1087
00:53:42,268 --> 00:53:49,078
are are enzymatically broken apart yeah

1088
00:53:47,369 --> 00:53:51,318
I mean I think there's there's got to be

1089
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:54,778
something like that we're currently

1090
00:53:51,318 --> 00:53:56,880
focusing on a couple of things on in

1091
00:53:54,778 --> 00:54:00,028
because we actually have a crisp

1092
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,119
community for sh-1 I think that you can

1093
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:06,480
compare between wild-type and mutant

1094
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:08,190
we're focusing on Solal structure so

1095
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,159
like the distribution and possible

1096
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:15,690
breakdown of very the various

1097
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:18,929
carbohydrates the pectin xilu cans and

1098
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:24,269
also there seems to be a hormonal

1099
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:27,480
response involved so yeah I'm just kind

1100
00:54:24,268 --> 00:54:28,889
of watch this space I don't know the

1101
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,730
data are too preliminary to talk about

1102
00:54:28,889 --> 00:54:34,980
but but yes I think you're the situation

1103
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:37,289
just outlined to be may well be what's

1104
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,909
going on well it's it's really

1105
00:54:37,289 --> 00:54:42,750
interesting and I really appreciate your

1106
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:44,338
doing your real rigor and efforts and

1107
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,809
looking across all these grasses and

1108
00:54:44,338 --> 00:54:47,608
finding that every time you look at it

1109
00:54:45,809 --> 00:54:49,470
it's different it's different and and

1110
00:54:47,608 --> 00:54:51,049
well that's it that's all that's

1111
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:52,549
challenging it's also incredibly

1112
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:55,700
exciting to think about all the ways

1113
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:57,980
that that crosses have come to the same

1114
00:54:55,699 --> 00:55:00,799
to the same conclusion but doing it

1115
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:02,539
differently to affect thinking about

1116
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,940
ecologically what differences that might

1117
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:09,079
make or what these responses to be and

1118
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:11,950
what adaptation these plans might be

1119
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:14,179
using this differential response to

1120
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:16,309
evolve towards this is really

1121
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:17,899
interesting as well yeah from an

1122
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:19,940
evolutionary point of view it actually

1123
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:22,599
makes no sense because all of these

1124
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:24,909
things have obsession zones they're all

1125
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:28,639
think you know I mean if you use a

1126
00:55:24,909 --> 00:55:29,929
strictly sort of phylogenetic definition

1127
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,369
of homology they're you know they're

1128
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:33,589
homologous in the sense that they all go

1129
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:37,039
back you know everybody has an obsession

1130
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:41,590
zone so perfectly when one move it yeah

1131
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:44,949
but but that's where it is thank you

1132
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:44,950
thanks Joseph

1133
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:53,210
looks like Jeff you have another

1134
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:54,558
question yes yes thanks yeah just

1135
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:56,920
occurred to me you know when you were

1136
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:59,630
showing all those really nice

1137
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,389
histological pictures about how variable

1138
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:04,910
different species were it makes me

1139
00:56:02,389 --> 00:56:06,679
wonder do you see that same lot of that

1140
00:56:04,909 --> 00:56:08,629
same variation perhaps within a species

1141
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:11,028
did your student look within a species

1142
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:15,108
to see how variable that was at that

1143
00:56:11,028 --> 00:56:17,960
level no we haven't met that sort of

1144
00:56:15,108 --> 00:56:21,619
follows you know Jim Holmes suggestion

1145
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:25,159
is is there are species that do bury and

1146
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:27,950
we just haven't drilled down to that

1147
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:32,618
that level of variation but but yeah I

1148
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:34,960
mean I think that starts to be you know

1149
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:36,950
it wouldn't have occurred to me that

1150
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,900
genetically or histologically there

1151
00:56:36,949 --> 00:56:41,929
would be variation within a species for

1152
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:46,039
obsession you know we know the position

1153
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:47,710
of it can change but now that we're

1154
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:51,289
finding this amount of diversity

1155
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:53,389
absolutely I think that would be one one

1156
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:55,730
way to go would be to look within a

1157
00:56:53,389 --> 00:56:57,920
species yeah I was I wasn't thinking so

1158
00:56:55,730 --> 00:57:00,318
much of position as Jim question but

1159
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,880
actually significant and you know like

1160
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:03,679
all of the whole suite of characters

1161
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,869
that the different types that you return

1162
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:08,989
to essentially yeah that's actually

1163
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:11,630
something variable yeah no that's that's

1164
00:57:08,989 --> 00:57:13,548
a good question and and we don't know we

1165
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:16,119
don't have the data all right thanks

1166
00:57:13,548 --> 00:57:16,119
yeah

1167
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:29,670
this has been a production of Cornell

1168
00:57:23,889 --> 00:57:29,670
