00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:10,500
sure Thank You Rochelle so good

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,020
afternoon everyone

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,089
today we have we have to research about

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,910
breeding for disease resistant but let's

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,778
start with my non edible switchgrass

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,179
first so my research my research is to

9
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:27,118
improve switchgrass population to be

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:30,359
resistant to diseases cost / furs

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,159
alrighty and today I would like to

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,109
introduce you what is switchgrass

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,609
because I don't think many of you know

14
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:38,250
where's about switchgrass how many of

15
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:41,250
you know switchgrass like literally

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,670
touch through scratch before it's pretty

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,350
each evil and and I'm going to am going

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,090
to tell you about background of the

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,370
disease that I'm working on the progress

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,900
of the selections of those diseases and

21
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:56,219
the correlation between the the

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:59,009
resistant of two diseases so this is me

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,310
with switchgrass and subscribe it's

24
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:04,679
pretty new newly domesticated crop it

25
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:08,070
was just domestic domesticated there's

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,930
only less than a hundred years ago so we

27
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:13,889
still have like lots of diversity in in

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,100
switchgrass and it was only about like

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,049
one decade ago that we use it for the

30
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:22,079
Department of Energy has selected

31
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,658
switchgrass as a biomass energy crop

32
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,329
so basically switchgrass was just grown

33
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,060
to like proposed to be the plan for

34
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:33,719
producing electricity like and also can

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,728
convert it to ethanol in the future in

36
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,310
the wind that when the gas ride is

37
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:40,469
pretty high not not this time but maybe

38
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,719
in the near future and you may think

39
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:46,019
that hey in these pictures like this

40
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,969
which has even like smaller than me and

41
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:50,879
like not that good in terms of the year

42
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:52,920
in this picture but but in this picture

43
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,548
it was taken in a Ralph Penn State

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,420
University and this area is proposing to

45
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,020
be an ideal area for planting

46
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,759
switchgrass

47
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:06,000
because it's a marginal land which means

48
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,489
that no other crop can make any play any

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,280
the good new based on this in this land

50
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,560
like in this in this area is a my

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,378
claimed area which means that like

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,998
nobody cares about that land and

53
00:02:15,378 --> 00:02:19,739
switchgrass was pushed through planted

54
00:02:17,998 --> 00:02:25,349
in that low my

55
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:27,060
no machi Nolan so and most of the

56
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,250
research that has been done in

57
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,009
switchgrass it's focusing on increasing

58
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,530
the you and other agronomic traits but

59
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:37,079
very few that's only couples of research

60
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,330
has been proposed about the disease

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,730
resistant in the switchgrass even though

62
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,360
the one of the disease that can reduce

63
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:47,489
the year up to 50% of biomass which is a

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,440
whole world of subscribe if you can if

65
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,810
you reduce the biomass of true scratch

66
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,030
like switchgrass is nothing for you so

67
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,280
these diseases caused by vipers or

68
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,460
actually help is significant not only

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,500
poor in the you reduction but also it

70
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,170
can reduce the germination which

71
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,000
switchgrass is a perennial crop so the

72
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:08,399
first year establishment it's very

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,490
important for switchgrass if it can

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,110
reduce the termination which means that

75
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:17,159
if we do so by our method you can get

76
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:20,450
for many years also so in my breeding

77
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:23,759
program I'm working with up to a plan

78
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:27,000
switchgrass shelter and cabin block and

79
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,979
based on that to diseases bikers or

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,650
vibrate leaf spot and by free to the

81
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:34,319
feedlot I separate into I separate them

82
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,960
into like two distinct paths distinct

83
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,169
breeding program and I'll reach done

84
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,000
than the true cycle of selection based

85
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,799
on those traits and I'm going to

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,439
continue the third cycle of selection

87
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,510
based on by for a seat dots and usually

88
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,359
why I'm keep continuing this and on

89
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:53,429
based on the second cycle of selection I

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,210
chase the reciprocal chase to see the

91
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,010
correlation between the trade so let's

92
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,580
move to the first resistant the

93
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:04,590
resistant to Vipers a leaf spot

94
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,510
basically Isis sprayed inoculum on the

95
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,330
forward for seedlings and cover with a

96
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:11,819
clear plastic bag for 24 hours release

97
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,610
it and leave it for 270 day servant

98
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:17,219
daily and evaluate the disease based on

99
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:21,660
the percentage of percent lesions on the

100
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,760
leaf and because the base species has

101
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,439
very few studies in previously so I

102
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,240
didn't know like this depict that

103
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,360
control background that control this

104
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,009
threat before so before you jump in in

105
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,330
general before you jump in for breeding

106
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:35,908
anything you should have

107
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:39,418
a background of these how is this is

108
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:40,769
irritable so I wanted to calculate the

109
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:43,318
first ability before I made any

110
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:45,658
selection so I could use a half succeeds

111
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,819
of the lowland types of Kelo in

112
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:51,288
greenhouse because I cannot produce the

113
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:54,419
secant of view in if it's too cold and I

114
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:57,839
produce a half succeeds of the cello and

115
00:04:54,418 --> 00:05:00,810
shelter in the field and and surrounded

116
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:04,378
by surrounding them virus welcome to

117
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:08,519
them to produce to read to prevent the

118
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:11,009
cross correlation between the plot but

119
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,139
sadly the her ability aren't based on

120
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:16,050
this resistant to bivariate leaf lot

121
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:18,210
it's significantly like non significant

122
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,340
or zero which means that I may not

123
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:23,158
expect any gain from selection on this

124
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,810
but I still hope that okay after two

125
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:28,579
cycle of selection I should get some

126
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:31,199
gain of this selection but sadly if I

127
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:34,050
didn't get any gains from the selections

128
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,030
from from this to like two years of

129
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,360
psycho selection so the y-axis is

130
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:41,459
percent disability the the higher the

131
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,819
bar the most acceptable it is so the

132
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:47,129
lower the more resistant but across the

133
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:48,629
psycho zero one two here

134
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,759
there's no like significantly

135
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:54,778
improvement on this so I didn't get any

136
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,968
significant gain from that or like

137
00:05:54,778 --> 00:06:00,300
significant realize irritability which

138
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:02,848
mean that I like the 50% of my PhD term

139
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:07,528
that has already devoted to this hats

140
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:10,829
like nothing so I so I stepped back and

141
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:12,870
I didn't cry but I stepped back and like

142
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:15,329
try to look at the bigger pictures like

143
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,389
okay I'm is like things like to narrow

144
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:20,158
to this like few cultivars that I tasted

145
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:23,728
only like couple cultivar

146
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:27,028
so last year I had a chance to access to

147
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:29,908
the Association panel which is a which

148
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:31,829
consists of five hundred and nine Jewish

149
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:35,370
quarter has been genotypes already and

150
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:37,649
it was transplanted in in Ithaca last

151
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,718
year so I have the chance to to went to

152
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:44,278
the field and do a few evaluations this

153
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:46,709
rough roughly and as it shows in the

154
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:49,019
segregation then an effort and we

155
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:51,000
like some variation in in the lowland

156
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,159
type and a plant type switchgrass so

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,350
based on this result I really hope I get

158
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,240
significant peep from genome-wide

159
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:02,340
Association analysis but again no

160
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,220
significant feed from this even though

161
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:07,979
the QQ plot shows it like shows no

162
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,320
significant at the end here like so so I

163
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,140
would try my last year of my PhD now

164
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,509
focus in this somewhere to try to

165
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,360
phenotype this trade again by now like

166
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,879
the detach the leaf from the field and

167
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,850
put it back in the green in the lab and

168
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,100
spread it evaluate the disease later so

169
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:30,810
I have five minutes with less moving on

170
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:32,430
to something something impressive I have

171
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,800
another disease resistant and do you

172
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,959
remember the disease resistant to by

173
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,670
forests it brought which basically I

174
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,039
didn't expect much about this so best

175
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,170
because I just softest the seat in the

176
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,900
interest water and queen as a control

177
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,220
compared with the the seats with the

178
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:51,479
treatment which is a

179
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,610
inoculum and based on that I collected

180
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,920
the data based on two minutes or not

181
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,139
zero and one so based on that comparison

182
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,210
I can also calculate the percent

183
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,629
termination reduction which I can turns

184
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:06,599
out that I can calculate hurts ability

185
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:09,180
based on hopsie however the way I make a

186
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,100
selection I make only like selection

187
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,470
based on individual fan shot if

188
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,590
germinate from the treatment one so I

189
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,880
need to find a way to calculate the

190
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:20,009
half-hertz ability based on individual

191
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,129
selection and I found a way to fit the

192
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:25,439
model in binomial model and luckily I

193
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:27,959
get pretty impressive like moderate to

194
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:32,490
high heritability based on how quick

195
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:35,490
selection went from point six eight two

196
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,950
point nine in each different cultivars

197
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,860
and let's focus on the individual

198
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,030
selection here that I get in cable of

199
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,340
the Omega selection

200
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:46,679
I had the point three for its ability

201
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:49,440
and which is which is also significant

202
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,779
fertility so I really have my last hope

203
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,230
in my ph.d program that it may work and

204
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:58,529
it and this result is showing the

205
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,180
progress of my selection the x-axis its

206
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:03,480
percent domination

207
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:05,699
and each pairs of the of the bar

208
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,930
representing each cycle of selection on

209
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,790
your left hand side

210
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:11,609
it's a Cuban drop and your right hand

211
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:13,860
side in the shelter so let's focus on

212
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,230
the parental line parental generation

213
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,539
the cycle zero you will see that the

214
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,300
blue bar which is a control one has high

215
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:23,219
significantly higher germination than

216
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:25,589
the red bar which is a percent

217
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,149
diminution of the treatment one which is

218
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,889
consistent with a shelter here also

219
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,980
there's significantly different

220
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:34,649
however with it within only one cycle of

221
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,930
selection I can reduce that gap between

222
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:40,379
the blue bar and red bar to non

223
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:42,029
significantly different and based on

224
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,950
that and based on this gap between the

225
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:46,919
blue barn red bar I plot the next graph

226
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:50,220
which y-axis represents the percent

227
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:52,159
termination reduction however I didn't

228
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,180
see I didn't see any progress

229
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,850
significant progress in heaven drops

230
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,979
from cycle zero one and two but you see

231
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:02,759
that the trail is reducing which means

232
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:05,450
it's more resistant to the disease when

233
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:09,419
we consider the shelter one from the non

234
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,400
the parent role I the reduction percent

235
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:14,909
reduction is pretty high but only one

236
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:19,409
cycle of selection it totally we reduced

237
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:22,709
that that one to two improve that a lot

238
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:25,740
so based on that I calculate I can I get

239
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:29,820
significant gain from from from this

240
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,950
trade up to like 100 percent like in one

241
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,490
cycle of the election which I need to

242
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,290
repeat that

243
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,029
I already repeat a couple times but I

244
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:36,629
need to repeat it again but it's pretty

245
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:38,970
impressive

246
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:42,750
only one cycle of selection can do that

247
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:45,240
and I would I wanted to compare with my

248
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,759
individual base rate ability but because

249
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,220
of the the trader is only zero and one I

250
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,129
cannot I cannot calculate the real life

251
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,250
heritability that's on that so I found a

252
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:58,529
way to calculate the liability validity

253
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,389
and you see here at point four it's

254
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:02,459
pretty close to quite through the egg

255
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:04,740
calculate earlier which means that okay

256
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:08,639
I got pretty like consistent results

257
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:11,310
from this selection and and now let's

258
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,439
compare these two resistant as soon as I

259
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:17,429
presented to you earlier I D

260
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:21,150
any impressive great game from resistant

261
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:23,929
to new spotlights our flat here but you

262
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:26,370
see the trend in recent to Citrix here

263
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:29,309
it's some improvement here some

264
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,049
improvement here which and so based on

265
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:34,289
this data I can calculate the

266
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:36,269
correlation between the resistant and as

267
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:39,929
a graphic yes there's no correlation

268
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:42,569
it's non significant here which I which

269
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:44,729
can explain that the mechanism behind

270
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,980
the resistant are different which make

271
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,840
sense rather the resistant increase and

272
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,620
resistant in seedlings a different stage

273
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:55,230
so which is has no correlation

274
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,509
so in summary due to the low and non

275
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,990
significant for the resistant to vibrate

276
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:03,480
leaf spot I didn't get any gain and from

277
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:06,029
selection and this year I'm going to try

278
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,129
the fewest analysis I get like improving

279
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:10,169
my phenotyping in the field again and I

280
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:11,789
hope I could come up with some mechanism

281
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:13,679
behind that some significant things

282
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:16,500
behind that and based on moderate to

283
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:19,199
high fertility of the resistant to

284
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,059
vibrate state law did what I get pretty

285
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,340
in although I didn't have like a

286
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:25,319
significant gauge in Kevin rock but I I

287
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,540
get pretty impressive significant gain

288
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,270
in shelter and we I'll continue the

289
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:31,699
selection of the third cycle again based

290
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:35,279
on the different trends in this

291
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,350
resistant I we get like month

292
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,740
significant correlation between these

293
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:43,440
two traits so thank you for autumn ila

294
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,940
and thank you for your attention where

295
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,390
we welcome for any questions or

296
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:54,679
suggestions

297
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:54,678
[Applause]

298
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,889
yeah so I calculate the brats and her

299
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:12,480
activities and even the button is only

300
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:14,159
23 for that so I need em and because

301
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,430
luckily it was not a good representative

302
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,829
year because it's a it's pretty dry and

303
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,870
it's not a like it's not good for my

304
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,340
disease to occur in the field and also

305
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,560
the plan was so small you were just

306
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,269
transplant it so it's like b-sides and

307
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:32,329
compared to like this side of

308
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:32,329
switchgrass that it should be so yeah

309
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:41,100
what would slightly so it's rendered

310
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,840
from a pet apply to octopi and the one

311
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,259
that I make the selection is our octopi

312
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,060
so it may like have some like like

313
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:54,149
difficulty in terms of like pushing

314
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:55,619
those genetic oh I'm so this I try like

315
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:58,199
couple of them but the one that I

316
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:06,330
present that to you is useless only I by

317
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:09,990
using our block package oh the point the

318
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:13,410
point in this case is I use I try our

319
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:15,870
blob and tassel because a switchgrass

320
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:18,899
although it's octopi and that apply but

321
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:23,750
it has a diatomic stacked equation so we

322
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,750
can like use those like part with it yep

323
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:32,879
to come after this has been a production
