1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,120
University yeah thank you very much for

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,519
K's invitation and J's introduction so

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,000
um because I had some misunderstanding I

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,039
thought like a full of us will share the

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
total eight minutes so I try to make my

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,599
slides as compact as

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,359
possible so only three slides uh so this

9
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,118
is the format we used for our and CR

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,480
science uh lighting talks only three

11
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:33,238
minutes three slides so

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,359
uh I would like to bring you to a

13
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,039
totally different scale from the the

14
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:42,079
previous two speakers and also last

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:46,840
speaker by Mike um my lab uh our scale

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:49,640
of was actually very large well the the

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,800
I usually start my talk from this two

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,000
dimension scale the in space and in time

19
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,319
so in space we start from Leaf scale all

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,518
the way to the globe and at the time

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,198
scale we uh our research ranges from

22
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:07,640
hourly all the way to the decadal

23
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:10,679
scale so keep this in mind uh we uh my

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,359
the the research program uh we try to

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,720
answer two fundamental questions number

26
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,759
one we try to understand how the natural

27
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,478
ecosystems and also the agriculture

28
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,478
systems respond and feedback to the

29
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:25,799
climate change and climate varability

30
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:29,200
and how they uh respond to anthropogenic

31
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:33,200
activities uh so uh again the scale is a

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,040
major uh SE uh in my lab so here the

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,159
second question I want to answer is like

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,040
how can we harness the best sensing

35
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:43,840
technology to monitor the um

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,399
interactions of these um agriculture

37
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,320
system natural systems uh with the uh

38
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,000
climate change and anthropic activities

39
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,919
and how we can utilize the stateof art

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,200
uh models process based models uh to

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,118
predict such interaction feedbacks in

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,079
order to inform plant policy making so

43
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:05,118
here in the blue fun I tried to

44
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,519
highlight some of those um uh projects

45
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:10,360
uh we uh conducted under these two major

46
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:14,439
seams uh so the research are funded by

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:18,000
Doe usaid SF USDA and Ceda and also

48
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:20,639
Cornell Atkinson and also the six grand

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,360
challenges the major two approaches

50
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,559
number one uh we try to use the remote

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,120
sensing observations mostly from

52
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,360
satellites but we also utilize ort

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,159
remote sensing uh and also uh the tower

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,920
based sensing Technologies uh so here I

55
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:40,120
try to give you this example of showing

56
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:44,079
this latest a fleet of NASA uh

57
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:48,640
satellites um all the way from 1970s uh

58
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,519
to uh uh 20 to beyond the 2030s so we

59
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,119
utilize uh different types of

60
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,039
observations starting from including

61
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,000
Optical remote sensing thermal remote

62
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,560
sensing micro remote sensing lighter

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,719
remote sensing and also gravity remote

64
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,719
sensing to really reveal different

65
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,959
aspect of the earth system uh like the

66
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,560
uh for example the so moisture um

67
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,519
vegetation house and also like water

68
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,519
availability so I'm going to give you a

69
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,239
few examples later the second uh

70
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,879
approach we use is called process based

71
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,599
model uh this uh one example is uh the

72
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,919
Earth model or a climate model so such

73
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:29,598
models have been utilized for the ipcc

74
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:33,679
climate report AV a few years so why we

75
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:37,000
use such um models because it can help

76
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,840
us uh uh understand the mechanism so

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,120
basically we try to put the mag magntic

78
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,319
understanding into mathematical

79
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,560
equations and put into these type of

80
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,359
models so such models have like

81
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,640
different components including land

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,879
components ocean component uh

83
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,318
atmospheric components and also like ice

84
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:56,878
sheet everything put together so that we

85
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,479
can utilize such models to simulate the

86
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,560
past and also simulate the future so

87
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,759
here

88
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,719
uh you know this is one typical figures

89
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,679
um uh which is output of such models

90
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,959
basically these models can simulate the

91
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,599
past so during the past where it overlap

92
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,120
with the remote sensing technology uh

93
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,560
this data set can be utilized to

94
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,280
Benchmark such model simulations so once

95
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,280
we gain confidence of such model

96
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,039
simulations we can utilize these models

97
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,839
to project the future to see okay under

98
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,960
uh different uh economic orual emission

99
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,000
scenarios what's going to be look like

100
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,000
for the L system and also for the

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,560
atmospheric system and also ocean system

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,478
everything but here my lab focus on the

103
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,879
again the Eco terrestrial ecosystems and

104
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:43,399
also the agriculture systems so these

105
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,519
are two uh major geospatial tools we use

106
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:50,599
uh in my lab of course on top of that we

107
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:52,439
also put AI uh uh uh uh to um enhance

108
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,120
the the capability of these

109
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:57,600
tools then uh here I'm going to give you

110
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,720
some specific examples of the uh

111
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,680
research projects uh I really like to

112
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:09,080
put uh divide my resch projects into um

113
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,959
this um um this metrics um so this D one

114
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,439
dimension is field skill versus regional

115
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,758
skills and Beyond another dimension is

116
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,839
what tools we use uh including post

117
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:22,038
observations and also process based

118
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:24,359
models so at the field skill we try to

119
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:26,599
develop sensing technology and different

120
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,720
observational data to monitor crop

121
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,879
growth and Dynamics governed by the

122
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,800
genetic environment and management so

123
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,839
here these uh two figures left one shows

124
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,918
this two coupled Tower systems that put

125
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,839
uh the a currence measuring carbon water

126
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:47,000
and energy fluxes and also another uh

127
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:50,038
system that monitors the um hypers

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,038
spectral uh and also chlorop fluoresence

129
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:54,000
measurements so that we harness the two

130
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:55,800
measurements to understand the

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,519
vegetation house and their response to

132
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,639
different management including

133
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,959
irrigation nitrogen management and also

134
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,280
different stress in the meantime we also

135
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,839
develop the Drone technologies that can

136
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,839
uh put concurrent measurement of

137
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:11,000
hyperspectral and also florescence

138
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,918
measurements that can really look at

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,319
many different targets including

140
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:18,439
different U management treatments and

141
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,080
also a breeding plots to look at their

142
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,598
uh different uh

143
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,198
functions at the regional scale we

144
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:27,759
utilize really many different types of

145
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,439
satellite data to Monitor and assess the

146
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,000
the uh food water

147
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,598
sustainability uh in both Africa and

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,120
China so the first example shows the

149
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:41,240
left figure shows okay the the uh the

150
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,720
two decades of depletion huge water

151
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,400
depletion in Northern uh western China

152
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,880
but this is a mystery of what was causes

153
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,439
for such a long-term depletion so we

154
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,079
look at these gravity data set which

155
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,719
give you information of total water

156
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,560
storage and in the meantime we look at

157
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,720
the land use land cover change they said

158
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,720
and also um the soil moisture and also

159
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,080
VAP transformation data set uh in the

160
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,199
end we found it was really the crop

161
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,318
expansion because of cotton growth that

162
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:12,360
has dramatically uh expanded in the past

163
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:15,160
couple of decades that led to this huge

164
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,479
depletion of water uh the total water

165
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,720
storage because this is a very dry area

166
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,758
and the the coton system really depends

167
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,160
on irrigation but because it's very dry

168
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,639
uh there's no water so the water should

169
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,080
really come from the ground water so

170
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,240
where the ground water come from That's

171
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:34,399
from the Glacier melting from tension

172
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,478
Mountain so very very complex system so

173
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,198
here we try to use the Sal data set to

174
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,680
really reveal what's exactly going on

175
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,240
and another example is like we try to

176
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,918
utilize again different um salite data

177
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,840
set to understand the impact of land

178
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:51,878
restoration program in estopia so uh

179
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,598
there has been a million multi-million

180
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,479
dollar um investment from the ethopia to

181
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,839
put different uh the land restoration

182
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:04,158
programs but so far we don't know what

183
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:06,679
is large scale national scale impact so

184
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:09,478
we utilize different salite data set to

185
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,560
uh to evaluate okay what is productivity

186
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,598
under uh under drought turns out that

187
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,319
such restoration program can actually

188
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:19,639
improve the drought restoration for

189
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,080
productivity so such analysis can be

190
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,158
done by the conventional approaches with

191
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,439
like a very sophisticate surveys that

192
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:30,639
are labor intensive and um very time

193
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,320
consuming so um also at the field scale

194
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,799
we utilize models so this is the

195
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,919
collaboration um with my Gore and K

196
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,359
Robins so we try to um harness multiple

197
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,958
remote sensing

198
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,680
Technologies uh and crop growth models

199
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:46,719
and also AI to inform uh crop reading so

200
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,919
while my students were trying to run

201
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,759
very sophisticated 3D radiative transfer

202
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:55,799
models that um um benchmarked by the uh

203
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:59,679
the uh ligher measurement to see what is

204
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:02,879
the best uh optimal uh uh corn structure

205
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:05,639
that will have the the best um

206
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,799
productivity for the future and finally

207
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,399
we utilize both models and remote

208
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:13,879
sensing data to look at the future uh

209
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,600
crop yield productivity and also how the

210
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,879
agricultureal revolution can impact the

211
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,159
global carbon cycle so one um project we

212
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,720
are um in collaboration with uh the unar

213
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,879
which is natural Center for atmosic

214
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,600
research trying to understand okay what

215
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:31,480
is the past uh uh driver uh the the

216
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,278
Revolution including the fertilizer and

217
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,159
the genetics can impact the the the uh

218
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:40,559
the CO2 uh amplitude uh increase over

219
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,000
the past few uh past five decades which

220
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,919
has been a mystery so these are few

221
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,879
projects I want to highlight but in the

222
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,639
meantime we also work a lot on natural

223
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,759
vegetation including Amon Congo

224
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,519
rainforest and also the uh the carbon

225
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,480
and water uh uh coupling in the across

226
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,919
the US so um yeah that's all I have

227
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,480
thank you

228
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,399
any questions

229
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:10,560
you yeah would you let us know that what

230
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:15,039
type data you can collect at the field

231
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:19,199
scale okay so uh maybe Kelly can um also

232
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:21,159
CH in okay yeah so here we uh try to the

233
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,519
data set we collected including liar

234
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:26,199
data that's led by my G group and there

235
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,159
are also uh the uh multi-spectral

236
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,240
measurement from UAV so lighter data was

237
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,078
from like rowers and also mod spectral

238
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,000
that's from uh from UAV and we also have

239
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:39,159
some florescence data sets uh that is

240
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,839
measured by UAV so uh Kelly and I were

241
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,838
uh just got this six grand challenge

242
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:47,360
proposal that we want to collect more

243
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:49,560
data in the g2f field uh in mrave so the

244
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,759
uh of course this is like AI based

245
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:55,119
project so the the the the final uh

246
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,759
typical data also like you know we are

247
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,560
looking at a lot of like of the uh

248
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,759
trades in in the latent space which

249
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:05,958
probably don't know what what they are

250
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:10,000
but we uh other like more um expl traits

251
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:12,599
includes uh say plan height um Lai you

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,360
know Leaf angles or those uh of course

253
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,159
yield so all of these different

254
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,519
information but we're still looking at

255
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,919
the data sense so yeah so that's why you

256
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,078
know we're interested in like how you

257
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:25,360
are trying to optimize the uh cus

258
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,759
structure to get the the maximize the

259
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,440
productivity of of

260
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,639
apples question second in advaning this

261
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,639
what what are the mix right is it

262
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,560
quality of the Imaging the satellites is

263
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,959
it the compute power is it the number of

264
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:43,078
people models is it the ground truth in

265
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,599
data sets or is it oh that's a great

266
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,199
question and a very hard to answer

267
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,278
actually both to me fall is everywhere

268
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,120
so from the sensing technology part I

269
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:54,720
think the data on certainty is really

270
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,200
really huge especially for Sal REM uh

271
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,920
because of course we do have a lot of

272
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,879
datas but we don't know um uh the level

273
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,199
uncertainties and how to trace those

274
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:05,360
uncertainties so that's something we

275
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,360
have been working very hard on uh to

276
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,120
trace those uncertainties so that we can

277
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,480
really link the satellite sensing signal

278
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,759
with the actual variable or or trace of

279
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,000
our interest so that that's very hard I

280
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,360
think for the ground remote sensing I

281
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,879
think we're B necked by like the number

282
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,720
of like the the ground labels we have uh

283
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:28,120
I think that's that that that's quite

284
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,320
hard to me and another challenge

285
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,320
probably like analy tools like what is

286
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,000
the best way to really harness remote or

287
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,639
the uh the process based models and also

288
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,720
um AI you know a lot of people are

289
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:41,360
talking about like we we should create

290
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,120
like knowledge B Mach learning but you

291
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,480
know there are a lot of different ways

292
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,399
of how to do that in a best way and most

293
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,399
eff way of course the once we use like

294
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,159
the Deep learning or AI the computation

295
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,278
power is always challeng so I I would

296
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,639
say the challenge is everywhere so a lot

297
00:12:54,278 --> 00:13:01,120
of work to

298
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,120
do okay many thanks here

299
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:08,839
this has been a production of Cornell

300
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:11,239
University on the web at cornell.edu

301
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:15,040
right okay there's one slide that's not

302
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,039
patterned correctly sorry

303
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:19,719
Jos right so I'm going to tell you guys

304
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:21,198
today our lab works on patterning

305
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,560
especially of leaf grasses we want to

306
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:25,519
know how leaves are initiated from the

307
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,599
maram and how they form these beautiful

308
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,560
structures such as the the blade this

309
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,759
Lial and the sheet we've done a lot of

310
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:37,198
comparative analyses between uh UDOT and

311
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,240
grass leaves there's lots of differences

312
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,679
in morphology I'm going to focus today

313
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,519
on these two the differences in the leaf

314
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:47,239
base whereas in new diecuts uh the leaf

315
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,799
bases are usually non sheathing and

316
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,000
they're accompanied often times by these

317
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,799
stipules these lateral derivations

318
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,720
whereas grasses form sheathing Lea bases

319
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:59,479
as you can see better on this slide of

320
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,199
real plants a you diecut this one has no

321
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,278
but you can see the leaf inserts and it

322
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,679
doesn't spread it all around the stem

323
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:09,399
whereas This Grass plant this is maze

324
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:11,638
you can see at the node the sheath is uh

325
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,958
overlapping it forms a sheathing Leaf

326
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:18,159
base where there's a wrapper inside of a

327
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,359
Tucker and we know that this happens in

328
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,719
the sheath anyway at at the point of

329
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,879
emergence so if you're looking here at

330
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,680
the node in this CT image this computer

331
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,240
tomography image this is uh below where

332
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:30,479
the leaf will initiate move up a little

333
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,680
bit you can see they're already

334
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,680
overlapping as soon as they emerge we

335
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:37,198
know this from CT analogy also from

336
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,120
sectors if you have a sector here it'll

337
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,599
Mark both sides of the sheet but not the

338
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,320
blade they come off the mar stem they

339
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,839
come off the stem already overlapping so

340
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,759
how does this happen so we've used a

341
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,120
genetic approach to understand how these

342
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,839
leaves wrap and a long time ago we

343
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,159
worked on these two mutations called Nar

344
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,440
sheath one and Nar sheath two double

345
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,039
mutations make a leaf that is very very

346
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,759
skinny so this is a model of how leaf

347
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,480
leaves are may be patterned into at

348
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,159
least three medialateral domains the

349
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,800
central domain which gives rise to the

350
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,600
mid rib shown here the lateral domain

351
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,159
which is large part of the leaf and the

352
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,720
marginal domain we think our narrow

353
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:15,958
sheath mutants delete this blue region

354
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,959
here this marginal domain which is uh

355
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,559
basically goes about halfway up the leap

356
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:23,078
blade and all the way down into the

357
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:26,439
sheath and as a consequence these leaves

358
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:29,399
no longer wrap they look like pseudo

359
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,399
UDOT morphology this is almost like a a

360
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,600
if you do a cross-section through this

361
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,278
cartoon of the marem show these real

362
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,839
leaves here this is the fourth Leaf from

363
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,879
the marem here's the marem while type

364
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,240
they overlap the marginal domain is

365
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:44,600
there narrow sheath removes this blue

366
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,560
domain and these leaves no longer WRA

367
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,480
they look more like a

368
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,599
udon and just quickly you look at the

369
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,759
expression this is a Sho at glan with

370
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,959
two Leaf

371
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,639
primordia about a two we old seedling if

372
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,039
you do a cross-section about this level

373
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,879
you can see the marem in the middle this

374
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,599
outer Leaf the second Leaf of the marem

375
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,039
you can see expression shown with this

376
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,240
dark blue area of narrow sheet at the

377
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,599
margins and it promotes growth from

378
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,879
those margins and this is actually the

379
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,519
P1 the margins are not yet out from the

380
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:15,519
marem but they're going to come out and

381
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,600
this marks where they're going to

382
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:22,240
form okay so we think the narrow sheet

383
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,800
provides this outgrowth from the leap

384
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,639
margins now in maze there's actually two

385
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:30,120
other wax genes this is genetics or maze

386
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,159
genetics there's four of these there's

387
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,278
only one in arabidopsis so we knocked

388
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,639
out these other two called wa 3B walk 3A

389
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:41,439
unfortunate names and we found that

390
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,600
triple mutations with Naros one wax 3A

391
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,199
make very very very skinny leaves look

392
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,959
at the sides of the scale bars here

393
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:50,519
compared to the Naros double mutant and

394
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,958
then the uh the wild type these are what

395
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,440
the plants look like they're very very

396
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:57,879
short and they're very very curly and we

397
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,639
think these mutations Nar one two

398
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,519
together wat 38

399
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,279
remove not just the marginal domain

400
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,120
shown here but also this large red

401
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:07,838
lateral domain all you're left with is

402
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:10,000
the central domain and these triple

403
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:13,240
mutants and the growth happens from the

404
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,318
upper part of the Le okay so the

405
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,480
question is now how do these margins

406
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,000
wrap what is the pattern of how they

407
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,480
wrap and it's been noticed that

408
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,199
basically if you look again here's uh

409
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,318
the base of the sheet there's the node

410
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,200
there's a wrapper and a Tucker if you do

411
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:32,240
a cross-section of a Seedling here's the

412
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,798
stem you see a couple leaves here notice

413
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,880
if if you draw a line through the middle

414
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:40,359
of the stem all the leaf margins that

415
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,000
that are derived from the right side of

416
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:45,359
this stem will be wrappers and all the

417
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,759
ones from the left side will be Tuckers

418
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,918
and this pattern is robust it's

419
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:53,400
decidedly non-random and and grasses we

420
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,880
say the same thing happens in rice and

421
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,200
if you look at these as colorcoded

422
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,159
Richie likes to color code these this is

423
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,120
a wild type made and

424
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:06,640
rice a non-random pattern of wrapping

425
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,839
and tucking all the margins coming from

426
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,000
this side will be wrappers from this

427
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:12,599
side will be Tuckers so the question is

428
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,440
are there mutations that disrupt this

429
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:17,639
pattern and of course there are I

430
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,120
wouldn't tell you about them um so this

431
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,960
one you can see everything was good

432
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:25,359
until this one made a mistake wrong side

433
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,319
it's a random mistake this next one

434
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,759
didn't really go through the Mac to PC

435
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,759
conversion very well but you can see

436
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:35,759
this one actually made two mistakes and

437
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:38,400
we find this in plants that are mutated

438
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:41,798
in higher order walk stre mutations so

439
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,519
if these plants are homozygous for wre a

440
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:45,639
and then homozygous for at least one of

441
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,639
the other Naros sheet genes heterozygous

442
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,679
for the other they'll give this random

443
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,080
patterning of wrapper tuck and the the

444
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,159
the mistakes that these make are random

445
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,359
they get more and more severe as you go

446
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:02,000
up the plant make more and more use

447
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,639
so our mutants are in charge of this

448
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,038
which was a surprise we didn't expect

449
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,440
this actually if you look at it closely

450
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,119
looking looking at some markers and this

451
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,640
is the cross-section through the stem

452
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:14,359
wrapping and tucking looking at this

453
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,720
fourth Leaf shown here the expression of

454
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:19,599
this boundary Gene cck two which marks

455
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,759
very stiff cells that are very very slow

456
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:25,079
to divide it's it's heavy in the Tucker

457
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:28,279
not in the W you think this prevents

458
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:31,480
this uh this margin here from growing

459
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:33,798
and kind contrast wa 3A a gene which

460
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,679
makes leaves grow from the margins it's

461
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:38,679
expressed very heavily in the wrapper

462
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,400
part of the P4 but not the Tucker we

463
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,480
think this promotes growth to make this

464
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,960
thing wrap

465
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,960
around okay so that's what we're looking

466
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,759
at now so what Richie is doing now a

467
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,798
graduate student in the lab is is micro

468
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:53,279
dissecting with our ler micro dissection

469
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,319
scope the marginal domains of the

470
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,599
wrapper and the Tucker put them in

471
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,359
separate tubes figure out what genes are

472
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,000
being expressed here doing the same

473
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,639
thing for the lateral

474
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,159
domains and the central domain put them

475
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,280
all in different tubes make libraries

476
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:08,880
out of them see what's going on in terms

477
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,759
of gene

478
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,799
expression okay yeah that's what we're

479
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,879
going to do next so I'm going to skip

480
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,879
this and uh I think we have time for

481
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,320
this weirdness so there's another

482
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,640
mutation we're working on the lab was

483
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,480
actually found here at Cornell by

484
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,000
Emerson person this sping this made 1912

485
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,720
it's called lius this as the name

486
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
suggests this mutation removes the liul

487
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,880
which is shown here the boundary between

488
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,480
the blade and the sheath it's gone so in

489
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,720
Wild type we have these extended sheath

490
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,120
margins look at these These are

491
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,120
epidermally derived they're non-

492
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,279
chlorophos to the margin we think this

493
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:49,359
gives rise to the Liu narrow sheath

494
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,119
removes the marginal domain so these

495
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:54,319
extended sheath margins are gone the Liu

496
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:56,119
is still there but they're gone we found

497
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:59,639
the in lious mutants and this was uh

498
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:02,079
never described before we you see topic

499
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,520
expression of this sheet margin

500
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,439
extension way up into the blade and it

501
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:09,000
always happens on the Tucker side so

502
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,320
it's an asymmetric signal happen so lius

503
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,960
one unexpectedly is also involved in

504
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,678
patterning this wrapper

505
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,640
Tucker okay now it gets really weird if

506
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,840
you look at triple mutations narrow

507
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,640
sheath which should have no margins

508
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:27,519
combine them with lulus somehow the

509
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,360
margins of this triple mutant are

510
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,839
restored they're also ectopically

511
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:35,240
displaced on the Tucker side only so

512
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:38,119
somehow if you add these three mutations

513
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,720
together somehow narrow can now grow

514
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:43,158
margins again so we suspect wax Trea is

515
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,360
being patterned patterned there to do

516
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:48,360
that and even more weirdly if you look

517
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,639
at these triple mutant leaves the base

518
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,959
of the sheath are often times fused they

519
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,759
don't separate no wrapper no Tucker

520
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,120
their fuse if you look at the uh

521
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,319
microscopy you can see these margins

522
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,918
here don't

523
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,759
they can't decide whether to wrap or

524
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:07,320
tuck so they're fusing they're all

525
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:10,240
confused and the last side shows a

526
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:12,158
expression of wat 3A which should be a

527
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,679
heavy on the wrapper so these two Leaf

528
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,000
margins are confused they don't know

529
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,880
whether to wrap or tuck and this one is

530
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,480
fused it's got It's like a two-headed

531
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,200
monster it doesn't really uh know which

532
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,798
way to wrap which way to tuck so there's

533
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,919
a lot of work to do to figure this out

534
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:30,519
in the next couple years and I'll take

535
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:30,520
any questions if there's time

536
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:39,038
yeah so we haven't uh we we could asked

537
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,480
that question all the time we have no uh

538
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:44,000
done any experiments to see whether or

539
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,720
not this rapper Tucker mutations um are

540
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,038
affecting yield we're probably never

541
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,798
going to do those experiments tell you

542
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:49,519
the

543
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:52,639
truth

544
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,960
y yeah do you have any IDE to like

545
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,799
signaling

546
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:01,919
that left right so um we know that the

547
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:03,519
first sleeve decides the pattern whether

548
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,159
it's going to wrap this way or wrap that

549
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,839
way and it's random like an arabidopsis

550
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,278
the spiral filot taxi is going to happen

551
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:12,519
but it may be left or it may be right so

552
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:16,278
that first decision is random we're

553
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:18,759
trying to figure out now what how walk

554
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:20,440
stre somehow in combination with lius

555
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:22,359
can decide whether or not it's going to

556
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,360
maintain that wrapping tucking

557
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:27,759
relationship um we suspect that the

558
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,639
signal to wrap and Tuck which side's

559
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,839
going to wrap and Tuck is sent really

560
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,000
early in leave primordial formation I

561
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:34,599
didn't show everything that Richie's

562
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,079
doing he's actually going to be micro

563
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:38,240
dissecting the fourth Le from the maram

564
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:40,240
all the way up to the second L for the

565
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,200
maram we think the signal happens really

566
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,759
early when it sends down the Plant but

567
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,440
that's what the big question is what is

568
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:50,558
the signal to make this wrapping tucking

569
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,120
pattern yeah that's a good question

570
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,918
sorry this kind of related question but

571
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,278
ever since qtl started to be detected or

572
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,679
or yeah people have have had this idea

573
00:23:58,278 --> 00:24:02,960
of breeding by Design where we would

574
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:05,200
understand what all the genes the plant

575
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,000
did and then we would put the right ones

576
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,759
in the right places and then we would

577
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,359
get higher you and to me as a Quant

578
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:15,158
seems Seems

579
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:17,399
hopeless but and I think your answer to

580
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:18,480
her question sort of was similar but I

581
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,360
wonder what you think about that and

582
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,759
like like like you study these things I

583
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:26,959
don't know if this has been back we not

584
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,879
but but does your does your research

585
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,038
illuminate anything about the about

586
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,440
prospects for breing by Design so we're

587
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,519
really uh interested in basic

588
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,278
fundamental mechanisms of development

589
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,759
and I don't really don't even think

590
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,960
about making more corn I don't say that

591
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,359
in my grant proposals but I really don't

592
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,278
think we need more

593
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,240
corn sorry need lock the doors Mike

594
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,599
can't

595
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,798
leave somebody in this room right I've

596
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:53,798
collaborated with Mike or a

597
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:03,759
lot any more questions yeah my what P

598
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,839
you you use to identify those

599
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:12,640
three n one

600
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:16,720
two what approach do do what what what

601
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,320
approach do we use so um I I

602
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,798
deliberately most of my talks are

603
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,639
labeled genetics and genomic analyses

604
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,480
but today I just uh use genetics we're

605
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,000
using lots of single cell RNA seek

606
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,278
spatial RNA seek Multiplex and C to try

607
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,599
to figure figure out how these patterns

608
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:34,640
uh form um and we're doing lots of

609
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:37,558
reverse genetics so yeah we're we're

610
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,240
doing um trying everything we can

611
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:41,158
actually to understand the mechanisms

612
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,480
we're really focused on the basic

613
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,480
biological mechanisms

614
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:50,679
so Nar one Nar 2 were identified at

615
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,359
Pioneer in a breeding stock they won't

616
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:55,038
tell us what the stock was but they just

617
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:57,599
arose and then walk 3 A and B we made

618
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,319
mutations by reverse genetics it seems

619
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,599
as if walk 3B I didn't mention this

620
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:02,558
doesn't seem to have an effect in

621
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:04,480
vegetative stages and might be affecting

622
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:06,759
later so that was done by reverse

623
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,278
genetics net 1 and two were identified

624
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:10,919
by forward

625
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:13,278
genetics clone the conventional way the

626
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,640
oldfashioned

627
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:19,480
way one more

628
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,480
question have you seen

629
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:28,000
orap

630
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:29,640
that and does that affect uh how unfur I

631
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,119
as

632
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,320
just in some before is that related at

633
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,798
all to that's a great question I mean if

634
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,759
very well could be um the degree of

635
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:43,720
overlap varies as you go from the base

636
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:45,798
of the plant a grass plant to the tip

637
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,919
the size of the inter node gets much

638
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:51,038
much smaller as you go up so they tend

639
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,038
to overlap more in the upper nodes and

640
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,839
lower nodes but they all come off the

641
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:58,798
marem off the stem in the sheath anyway

642
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:00,959
overlapping the blade components do not

643
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,879
they R

644
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,519
late great okay thanks Mike and thanks

645
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,520
all the speakers

646
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:13,639
today this has been a production of

647
