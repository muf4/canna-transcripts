1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,359
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:11,189
University

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:13,109
thank you well this is really a pleasure

4
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:15,149
for me to be here because I son I know

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:18,629
so many of you and there's gonna be a

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,130
lot of really fun science to cover over

7
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,768
the next day and I've had a great

8
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,839
morning already I love it that you guys

9
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,848
have your seminars at noon and not at 4

10
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,640
o'clock which is what Indiana University

11
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,649
does by 4 o'clock the audience is asleep

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,908
and the speaker is following asleep so

13
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:40,228
right by noon I think this is a great

14
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:42,689
schedule so my talk today is on these

15
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:46,109
extracellular vesicles those of you that

16
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:48,808
know my history know that this is not my

17
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:51,808
expertise or my background so this was a

18
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:53,399
new direction for my lab but that's part

19
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,169
of why I'm having so much fun with it

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,390
because I'm having to learn a lot of new

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,448
biology to understand what we've

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,338
uncovered and also the excitement of

23
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:05,640
going into it really is a new field in

24
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:08,129
plant biology so I hope to share some of

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,219
that excitement with you all today so

26
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:14,609
the the reason we got into this project

27
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:18,390
is all stems from this VM image right

28
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:21,209
here so zoom in just a little bit this

29
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,700
is a am image that we took trying to

30
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,229
follow up on a result from a japanese

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,780
group that was investigating the

32
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,969
question of how do plant cells die when

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,189
you activate a defense response the

34
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:33,450
classic defense response I think most of

35
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,359
you probably know is called the

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,030
hypersensitive resistance response it's

37
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:42,120
marked by rapid breakdown of cell

38
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,099
membranes and cell death and this

39
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,439
Japanese group had published a paper

40
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:49,408
suggesting that the key event was fusion

41
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,629
of the vacuolar membrane which in this

42
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,250
image this these are two Arab adopts as

43
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:55,319
musical cells that have been infected

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,750
with an Abrial and strain of Pseudomonas

45
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,119
and this thin layer here is the

46
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,019
cytoplasm and then that's cell wall this

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:07,320
is extra cellular space and we were

48
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:09,840
really interested in this vacuolar

49
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,909
membrane adjacent to the plasma membrane

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,409
and we were looking for fusion events

51
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:16,689
because that's what had been reported in

52
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:18,849
this paper and so we used

53
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:21,870
algae called focused ion beam scanning

54
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:24,849
electron microscopy to take literally

55
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,580
300 serial sections through an

56
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:29,289
Arabidopsis leaf looking to see if we

57
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,780
could find any of these fusion events

58
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:34,449
that had been supported we couldn't we

59
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,229
did not find any of these fusion events

60
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:40,989
but we did find were these things which

61
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:43,629
were really interesting structures to me

62
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,700
I didn't really they weren't in the

63
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:49,479
textbooks that I had been brought up on

64
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:51,969
and so I showed these images to a plant

65
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:55,119
cell colleague of mine at IU Sid Shaw

66
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:56,770
who's really a great cell biologist say

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,680
it had been an undergraduate with Andrew

68
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,880
Staley at University of Colorado Boulder

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,810
it was one of the people who was on my

70
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:08,400
committee as a graduate student and Sid

71
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:13,120
knew these as para mural bodies and so

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,610
see you zoom in on those things they're

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,180
really interesting because the plasma

74
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:22,480
membrane is broken down underneath them

75
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,069
and so the general thought from e/m

76
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,229
images of these so-called pyramidal

77
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:27,219
bodies is that they are actually dumping

78
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:29,169
vesicles

79
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:31,870
into the extracellular space so here's

80
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:34,329
cell wall here this is the vacuole or

81
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,370
membrane this is the plasma membrane and

82
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,510
the cytoplasm is this thin little shell

83
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,200
right here

84
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:42,969
but these para mural bodies are pretty

85
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,280
large structures relative to the width

86
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:47,229
of the cytoplasm and so that obviously

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,739
takes some effort to make that kind of

88
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:52,780
structure and if you look at the thing

89
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,390
in three dimensions what you can do with

90
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,759
this focused ion beam SEM this is what

91
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:59,799
it looks like so you have these you know

92
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,239
sir this is what it would look like if

93
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,310
you're swimming around in the vacuole

94
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,739
looking out at the vacuole or membrane

95
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:10,360
so these things you know sticking to

96
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:12,789
that vacuolar space and so these seem to

97
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,380
be more abundant and leaves that we had

98
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:16,539
treated with Pseudomonas compared to

99
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,738
leaves that weren't they seemed like

100
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,379
they might be associated with the

101
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:23,289
defense response and now given this word

102
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:24,850
para mural body I could search the

103
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,039
literature to see whether anybody else

104
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,760
had reported these and described these

105
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:31,639
and I found out they

106
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,709
well documented in the 1970s in the

107
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:37,569
context of electron micrographs of

108
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:41,449
powdery mildew barley interactions and

109
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:43,550
these we go back to this these sorts of

110
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:45,620
structures you see collecting around

111
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,720
penetration sites and I'll show you some

112
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,670
more images of that in a moment but that

113
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,860
godess excited that we're on to some

114
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,170
defense response that had been kind of

115
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,780
overlooked in the context especially of

116
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:59,300
bacterial interactions so I put one

117
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:01,009
graduate student on it to start working

118
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,720
on it it's kind of a high-risk project

119
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,939
to see we can learn more about these

120
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,430
vesicles and in particularly challenged

121
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:11,750
him to see we could purify them and

122
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:14,600
we'll come back to that but I said I was

123
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,800
excited about this so I decided I wanted

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,830
to learn more about the electron

125
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,689
microscopy and to do that I went to

126
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:24,019
University of Colorado Boulder to see

127
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:26,209
Andrew Stalin get his wisdom he's

128
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:29,299
retired at this point but he was still

129
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:31,189
coming into his office every day and at

130
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,170
Universe Colorado Boulder they have at

131
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:35,300
the Center for 3d electron microscopy

132
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,189
and they also have expertise and high

133
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,840
pressure freezing which is a way to

134
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:41,660
really preserve the integrity of

135
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,939
membranes during fixing cells of any

136
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,220
type but especially plant cells so this

137
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:48,170
image here is one that I took on

138
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,020
sabbatical it's the only data that I

139
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:53,780
generated in this whole talk but I'm

140
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:57,859
proud of this so I talk about that and

141
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:59,869
what you see here is again so long this

142
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,750
is a chloroplast that starch granules

143
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,250
this is the cytoplasm but notice these

144
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,170
vesicles here they're trapped between

145
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,779
the cell wall and the plasma membrane

146
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:11,750
and it turned out I had no trouble

147
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:14,119
finding these sorts of images it's

148
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,800
common to see vesicles stuck between the

149
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,569
plasma membrane and the cell wall and

150
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,730
they don't even have to be infected

151
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:20,779
plants so this seems to be something

152
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:25,009
that's happening all the time and

153
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:26,689
musical cells at least and so this

154
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,759
really made me think that it might be

155
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:30,949
possible that to purify these things

156
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,949
from the aprile class from the

157
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:37,269
extracellular space and that's what we

158
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:37,269
basically set out to do

159
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:43,529
but while in bold and yeah in bolder

160
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:46,229
talking to Andrew and you know showing

161
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:50,099
them these this image and and this this

162
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:52,290
image Andrew got excited about that and

163
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,600
said well those look like llamas ohms to

164
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,939
me and that was another word that I

165
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,760
didn't know I searched PubMed for llamas

166
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:02,699
ohm it wasn't even in there but it was

167
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,550
an Andrews brain and he went to his file

168
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,769
cabinet and pulled out this paper from

169
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,750
1967 you know Andrews office has this

170
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:13,579
wall of file cabinets and he knew right

171
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:16,470
where in the file cabinet this paper was

172
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:19,529
from 1967 which was just blew me away

173
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:24,090
but what this was is a carrot cell

174
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:26,609
culture and here's this beautiful um

175
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:30,479
images of what they labeled a multi

176
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:32,879
vesicular body opening up against the

177
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,460
cell wall and so it looked like these

178
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,709
vesicles were being now outside the

179
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:40,799
plant cell and again here these multi

180
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:44,430
particular body and then also in the

181
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,490
same paper there's this image and with

182
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,740
this shows in particularly is lots of

183
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,230
vesicles now in the extracellular space

184
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,490
and again and here's another multi

185
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,740
particular body that seems to be

186
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,720
emptying as vesicles out between the

187
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,699
plasma membrane and the cell wall and

188
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,880
here's kind of junction of three cells

189
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,099
and getting lots of vesicles so we've

190
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,639
literally known that plant cells produce

191
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,629
extracellular vesicles for over 50 years

192
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,669
but they've just been sort of

193
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,560
observations in e/m nobody's really

194
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:16,259
figured out what their role was and this

195
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,790
is what got me excited to try to figure

196
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,789
out you know what are these things doing

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,519
so there there have been of course

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,870
follow-up analyses of fungal plant

199
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,469
interactions where people are doing

200
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:34,620
eeehm and this paper here from 2006 so

201
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,810
now only 12 years ago had some beautiful

202
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,000
images this is from Ralph oklahomans lab

203
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,559
in Germany if you know any of else work

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,600
he works mostly on barley powdery

205
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:48,209
mildews interactions what is shown here

206
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,009
is a fungus penetrating through the

207
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,720
plant cell wall and this is

208
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:53,129
the epidermal cell and the plants

209
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,230
producing what's called a cell wall

210
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:58,529
opposition sometimes they're also called

211
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:01,440
papillae and and this is a buildup of

212
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:04,009
membranous material kalos and other

213
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,750
compounds that people think of as a

214
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:09,360
physical barrier to penetration by the

215
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,460
fungus and so this is just kind of a

216
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,269
cartoon drawing of it and what you can

217
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:17,160
see in this manuscript is or paper is

218
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:19,019
these param your bodies that are full of

219
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,240
vesicles that seem to be dumping their

220
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,220
contents into the cell wall opposition

221
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,789
again you see it here too but these are

222
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:30,560
complex membranous structures and so

223
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:34,289
again you know why what are they doing

224
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:36,719
and then this is now a similar image but

225
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:39,659
taken by a new collaborator of mine

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,120
Richard O'Connell who has a lab in ret

227
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:45,360
in France and he does beautiful high

228
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,600
pressure on eemm work and and this I

229
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,750
think are fantastic images and and what

230
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:55,409
is shown here again is plant cell fungal

231
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:57,929
cell vesicle here between the plasma

232
00:09:55,409 --> 00:10:01,799
membrane and and fungal wall in this

233
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:03,149
case importantly the fungus is this is

234
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,269
called talk Turkey I'm going to make on

235
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:07,679
a beam leaf the fungus also is producing

236
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:09,569
extracellular vesicles and that's what's

237
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,409
shown here so this is fungal cytoplasm

238
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:15,629
plasma membrane and these vesicles again

239
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:18,089
some more here and this is similar that

240
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:21,029
previous image from barley but now this

241
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,129
is on a beam leaf this is the papilla or

242
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:25,439
cell wall that position fungus trying to

243
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:28,529
penetrate and again lots of vesicles

244
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,820
being produced right here so there's

245
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:34,799
certainly lots of AM data then and then

246
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,350
the last one am in this series I'm going

247
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,269
to show you is this is I'm not taking in

248
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:43,590
my lab by my graduate student Brian

249
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:46,529
router this is a cross-section through a

250
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,180
historian powdery mildew infecting in

251
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:51,809
Arabidopsis leaves so this is an

252
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:54,959
epidermal cell and Arabidopsis this is a

253
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:57,500
lobe of the powdery mildew fungal

254
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,930
historian so lots of mitochondria here

255
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,759
this is extra historial matrix here so

256
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:03,719
the space between the plant cell which

257
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,759
is over here

258
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,870
and the fungal cell and what I want you

259
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,970
to note here is this darkly staining

260
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:14,399
membranous material and what this looks

261
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,610
like to me is micro villi on an

262
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,459
intestine so you've just hugely expanded

263
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:23,610
the membrane surface area at this

264
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:25,800
feeding site for the fungus so and this

265
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,019
is this is a compatible interaction that

266
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,740
the fungus is growing happily here and

267
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:33,389
so I interpret this as the fungus

268
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,090
inducing a massive outgrowth of the

269
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:39,419
plasma membrane of the host cell to

270
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:42,600
enhance transport of materials from the

271
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:44,969
host cell into the fungus but when you

272
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,800
look at this these sort of micro villi

273
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,779
type structure you can imagine that you

274
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,219
could easily pinch off vesicles directly

275
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,769
from the plasma membrane to make

276
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,590
extracellular vesicles so I think there

277
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:57,629
may be two independent ways to make

278
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,879
extracellular vesicles here one is

279
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:01,649
direct pinching off a plasma membrane

280
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,470
and the other is through this multi

281
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:10,829
vesicular body pair mural body pathway

282
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:12,149
that we was just showing so beyond the

283
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,940
e/m there's quite a bit of other

284
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:16,980
evidence before our work to suggest that

285
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,900
extracellular vesicles are important in

286
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,080
the defense response and this comes from

287
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:24,509
a series of papers so this is from hans

288
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,639
floral Christensen's lab now started to

289
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:29,819
collaborate with where they were using

290
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,830
fluorescently look tagged GT piezas that

291
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,420
are associated with multi particular

292
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:37,680
bodies and localizing them to sites of

293
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:39,779
fungal penetration so again this was

294
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,029
powdery mildew it was this work and they

295
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:45,750
showed that these MB bees that are

296
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:48,149
tagged with the gtp as marker accumulate

297
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:54,840
at the penetration sites and seemed to

298
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:56,909
be fusing with the plasma membrane work

299
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:01,080
that preceded that but is directly

300
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:04,980
related showed that syntax ins required

301
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:07,500
these same gtp aces to function in the

302
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,720
context of penetration resistance and so

303
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,360
this was work being done in both barley

304
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,000
and Arabidopsis where Paul's lab was

305
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,919
looking for a rabid office mutants that

306
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,399
became more susceptible to a barley

307
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:19,559
strain

308
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,929
of powdery mildew so normally that

309
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:24,419
barley strain can't even penetrate an

310
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:26,069
Arabidopsis epidermal cell and in these

311
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:28,349
mutants which they called penetration

312
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,910
mutants they found that the barley

313
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,360
powdery mildew could get further and

314
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:37,019
actually form a historian and so the one

315
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,759
of the mutants was a syntaxin and and

316
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:46,559
that's going to be a large player later

317
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:49,620
in the story here so that syntaxin they

318
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:53,969
showed in 2009 in a really seminal paper

319
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:56,580
that that syntax and accumulated in this

320
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,649
pillar matrix and the reason that was

321
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,960
important is that some toxins are

322
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:03,299
proteins that mediate membrane membrane

323
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,250
fusion so they are involved in mediating

324
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:08,129
the fusion of vesicles with the plasma

325
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,500
membrane normally they're considered

326
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:15,059
cytoplasmic proteins but anchored to

327
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:16,710
membranes by a c terminal signal and the

328
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:18,929
fact that they were getting outside the

329
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,150
cell was puzzling because they're not

330
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:22,529
normally secreted through a standard

331
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:24,689
secretory pathway they don't have a

332
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:27,329
signal peptide but yet they were showing

333
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,610
that these proteins were accumulating in

334
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:32,879
this matrix here and they even suggested

335
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,399
in this 2009 paper that perhaps they're

336
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,919
being secreted via extracellular

337
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,539
vesicles and they used the term exosome

338
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,490
which is common term used in the

339
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:44,219
mammalian field or extracellular

340
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:47,430
vesicles and so it was really this paper

341
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:50,700
that got us really focused on this idea

342
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:54,839
of figuring out if the exosomes are

343
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,580
important in defense okay so the kind of

344
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,920
questions raised by this that we wanted

345
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:02,070
to answer is what do these vesicles

346
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:04,319
contain how are they produced and what

347
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,940
triggers their release because we

348
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,860
already had evidence that there was some

349
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,100
sort of regulation of it obviously the

350
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:13,529
fungal penetration site was a place of

351
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,649
focus for a release and then obviously

352
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:18,539
what is it they do and so this is what

353
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,069
we embarked on trying to answer and

354
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:22,169
really all the work that I'm going to

355
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,470
present from here on out is from a

356
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:26,789
single graduate student Brian Rutter and

357
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,590
he has discovered all sorts of really

358
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:32,629
interesting things about these vesicles

359
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,000
so if before I jump into all that data

360
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:36,470
let me just review what's going on in

361
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,990
the mammalian world because there's a

362
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,509
lot of excitement a million world about

363
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:46,340
extracellular vesicles and so this comes

364
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:48,740
a 2013 review and the the main

365
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,080
excitement in the in the mammalian world

366
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,930
is that these vesicles contain small

367
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,990
RNAs so what's being shown here is small

368
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:59,179
RNAs being packaged into what are called

369
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,220
intraluminal vesicles in these multi

370
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:03,649
particular bodies or multi vesicular

371
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,050
endosomes these them fusing with the

372
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:08,269
plasma membrane releasing their vesicles

373
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:11,629
and then the vesicles being taken up by

374
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:14,659
mechanism that's not clear yet into host

375
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:16,850
cells those rnas get released and they

376
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:21,019
affect gene expression in the host cell

377
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:23,028
and so this is a really hot topic in the

378
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:25,159
mammalian world now because it turns out

379
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:28,309
there's all sorts of diseases that seem

380
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:32,240
to be mediated in part by extracellular

381
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:34,278
vesicles and in particular cancer cancer

382
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,549
cells release vesicles with a different

383
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:39,588
content of small RNAs compared to a

384
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:41,088
healthy cell and it seems to be

385
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:44,440
functionally important and I'll go

386
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:48,380
through some of the literature on that

387
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:51,170
shortly so this is what I just told you

388
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:53,029
so we'll skip through that so the

389
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:56,088
history of exosomes

390
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:58,100
in the mammalian world kind of dates

391
00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:00,020
back to just nineteen eighty-three so

392
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,470
you're a plant audience so you'll

393
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:06,349
appreciate this we knew about these in

394
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:08,120
plants a good 20 years before they

395
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:10,609
discovered him in their million cells so

396
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:14,088
once again plant biology is leading the

397
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:16,789
way so but this is was kind of a seminal

398
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:19,039
paper on the mammalian side where this

399
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:22,938
group was looking at receptor mediated

400
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,279
endocytosis of transferrin and recycling

401
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:27,709
of the transferrin receptor in during

402
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,509
red blood cell maturation and this is

403
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,789
simply using immuno gold to label

404
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:33,200
transferrin and showing that these

405
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:35,420
receptors which are normally on the

406
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,970
plasma membrane would become endocytosis

407
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,650
end up in these intraluminal vesicles

408
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,319
and then get dumped into the

409
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,540
extracellular space and at the time it

410
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,779
was thought of as a garbage

411
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:49,700
system so it didn't generate a lot of

412
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:50,359
excitement because who's interested in

413
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,299
garbage

414
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:55,609
and so these discovery of extracellular

415
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:58,700
vesicles basically just kind of was

416
00:17:55,609 --> 00:18:01,099
ignored for about twenty years mostly

417
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:08,000
because it was just considered a waste

418
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:09,490
system that all changed though in 2007

419
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,380
so now this is just eleven years ago

420
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:15,529
where this paper was published in nature

421
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,780
cell biology that demonstrated that x's

422
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:20,899
immediate transfer of messenger rnas and

423
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:23,930
especially micro rna's allowed exchange

424
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,490
of genetic information between cells so

425
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:28,610
suddenly this seemed to be a mechanism

426
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:32,000
for intercellular communication for

427
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:36,169
transferring micro rnas and so that kind

428
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,880
of set off a huge renaissance in the

429
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:44,330
study of extracellular vesicles so the

430
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,490
mixed paper here in 2008 again nature

431
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:48,339
cell biology this is interesting when

432
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,930
glioblastoma so brain cancer

433
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:53,449
microvesicles transport RNA and proteins

434
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:56,720
that promote tumor growth and provide

435
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:59,720
diagnostic biomarkers and so that's been

436
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,000
a really big deal for the biotech

437
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,250
industry because the idea is that you

438
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,789
can simply purify vesicles from your

439
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:10,609
serum or even your urine see what RNAs

440
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:12,649
and proteins are there and then be able

441
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:16,189
to say whether you've got cancer or not

442
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:18,470
and so it turns out that when we pee

443
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,500
there's lots of vesicles in our urine

444
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:23,299
and there are companies that have

445
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,789
already been set up but basically are

446
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:31,759
trying to develop a rapid urine based

447
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:33,769
bio test for cancer but they're also

448
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,140
involved in the immune system so this is

449
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:38,509
a relevant paper to our topic

450
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,030
unidirectional transfer of micro RNA

451
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:43,309
loaded exosomes from t-cells the antigen

452
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:46,490
presenting cells so it's probably a

453
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:50,179
critical component of our innate immune

454
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:53,509
system works viruses have learned to

455
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:56,269
co-opt the exosome system and so they

456
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:58,160
can make their own viral micro rna's so

457
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:59,480
it's like herpes virus and

458
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,830
they're showing functional delivery of

459
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,539
viral microRNAs yet exosomes also

460
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:08,389
involved in tumor metastasis

461
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:11,059
so exosomes released by melanoma cells

462
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:14,360
prepare sentinel lymph nodes per tumor

463
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:16,460
metastasis so the idea is before the

464
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,329
tumor cell moves it's releasing these

465
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,180
exosomes

466
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:22,250
they spread out to the body suppress

467
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:25,549
immune responses that might otherwise

468
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:29,440
control the moving cancer cell and then

469
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:29,440
allow colonization of distant tissue

470
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,730
awesome brain development so regulation

471
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:37,549
of post synaptic retrograde signaling by

472
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,500
presynaptic exosome release and this is

473
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:43,609
actually done in drosophila this one so

474
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:46,519
it's not just mammalian cells brain

475
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:48,649
immune system interactions so why do you

476
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,230
feel so crappy when you have a cold and

477
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:53,960
your thoughts are muddled well maybe all

478
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,579
needed by exosomes so extra cellar

479
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,799
vesicle mediated transfer of genetic

480
00:20:55,579 --> 00:21:00,109
information between the hematopoietic

481
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,450
system and the brain in response to

482
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:04,879
inflammation so this is one of the few

483
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,559
known mechanisms for transferring

484
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,360
genetic information across the

485
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:14,440
blood-brain barrier our disease secreted

486
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:16,490
micro RNA suppress a thorough genesis

487
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,789
behavior this is I think a really

488
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:22,519
interesting paper BMP regulated exosomes

489
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:25,549
from Drosophila male reproductive plants

490
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:28,819
reprogrammed female behavior so it turns

491
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:31,159
out that when fruit flies mate the

492
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:34,490
female does not want to mate again for

493
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,529
several days that behavior change and

494
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,470
not wanting to mate is dependent on

495
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:43,000
exosomes delivered by the male so that's

496
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:46,400
another fascinating aspect of exosomes

497
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,579
and probably the most relevant to this

498
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,370
talk is this paper from 2014 where

499
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:54,529
they're working on nematodes in mice and

500
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:57,619
it showed that exosome secreted by

501
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:59,960
nematode parasites transfer small rnas

502
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:02,359
to mammalian cells and modulate the

503
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,620
innate immunity and this is actually an

504
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:07,009
observation has been known for a long

505
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:09,049
time that people infected with nematodes

506
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:11,720
don't tend to have problems with asthma

507
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:15,079
there's immune system is suppressed

508
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,690
well it's probably mediated by micro

509
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:19,819
rna's that are being produced by the

510
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:25,009
nematodes so this is actually

511
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:27,799
fascinating okay so what's the evidence

512
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:31,279
that there may be RNA transfer by

513
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:34,519
extracellular vesicles and plants it

514
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:37,519
comes from this paper from Eileen Jin's

515
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,599
lab UC Riverside in 2013 I imagine many

516
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,470
of you saw this paper

517
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:44,719
she showed that botrytis produces small

518
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:48,680
rnas that can suppress plant immunity

519
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,360
and so what they did in that paper they

520
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,840
weren't looking at vesicles specifically

521
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:55,309
but they were able to I do

522
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:57,889
immunoprecipitate plants Argonaut

523
00:22:55,309 --> 00:23:01,129
proteins and show that they were bound

524
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:04,009
to botrytis small rnas and that those

525
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,990
small rnas actually targeted plant genes

526
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:08,390
so the conclusion from this science

527
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,120
paper was that botrytis fungus is

528
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,460
producing small rnas that somehow get

529
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,409
across but try this plasma membrane

530
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:18,650
across the plant plasma membrane and

531
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:21,590
then interact with RNA I system in the

532
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:24,560
plant cell and so for us this was a

533
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:26,089
smoking gun to suggest that tetra-cell

534
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,099
or vesicles might be meeting and

535
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:30,859
transfer small RNAs from a fungus to a

536
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:32,449
plant we're interested in whether it

537
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:36,740
might work in the other direction as

538
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:41,720
well so Eileen followed up on this paper

539
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:43,880
I guess two years ago in 2016 with this

540
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,490
paper showing bi-directional across

541
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,980
kingdom RNA I and fungal uptake of

542
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,589
external RNAs confer plant protection

543
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,799
that was in nature plants and there she

544
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:56,959
actually could use naked RNAi apply that

545
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,299
to botrytis and show that you could

546
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,610
silence botrytis genes just with naked

547
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:05,299
RNA so botrytis has some ability to take

548
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:07,519
up RNA from the environment but it had

549
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:10,190
been known before this work even that

550
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:14,329
you can express double-stranded RNA in a

551
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:15,920
plant that silence is a fungal gene and

552
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,839
it can work quite well it's called host

553
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,509
induced gene silencing which again

554
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,250
raised the question how do those rnas

555
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:24,339
get out of the plant into the fungal

556
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,140
cell

557
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:28,658
and then lastly and I think most

558
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,860
relevant to this talk on this paper also

559
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:31,630
in 2016

560
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:34,000
showing that cotton plants can expert

561
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,190
micro rna's to inhibit virulence gene

562
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,288
expression in a fungal pathogen this was

563
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:41,259
actually in cotton and British psyllium

564
00:24:38,288 --> 00:24:43,538
and there what this showed was that if

565
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:47,579
you identified these potential targets

566
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:50,650
in the fungus of the plant micro RNA

567
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:53,558
mutate that target so it's no longer a

568
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:56,080
base pair match to the plant micro RNA

569
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:57,759
you then made the fungus more virulence

570
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,460
and so that was pretty compelling

571
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:04,390
evidence that these micro rna's really

572
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:08,169
were targeting a fungal gene okay so

573
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:10,809
what we actually done so what we've

574
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:12,850
succeeded in doing is purifying the

575
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:15,849
extracellular vesicles and figuring out

576
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:17,740
what's inside of them and so the person

577
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:20,199
that did that is my grad student Brian

578
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,630
and this was his side project for the

579
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,009
first year and then turned into his

580
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,289
full-time project once they actually

581
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:28,538
figured out how to do it and so this is

582
00:25:26,288 --> 00:25:30,819
his protocol and if you're interested in

583
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:33,759
doing this yourself brian is put

584
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:38,109
together a really detailed protocol in

585
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:40,329
bio protocol complete with a video but

586
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:43,479
anyway it's relatively straightforward

587
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:46,869
you simply submerge your leaves or roots

588
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,880
it works or roots to in a buffer apply a

589
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:51,639
vacuum so suck out all the air from your

590
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,950
tissue release the vacuum it sucks the

591
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,809
buffer into the leaf you then do a low

592
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,850
speed centrifugation that gently

593
00:25:55,808 --> 00:26:00,038
squeezes the leaves so you can recollect

594
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:02,879
the fluid so that's just interesting

595
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:06,759
later wash fluid or April plastic fluid

596
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,850
we filter that to filter out any like

597
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:12,069
broken trichomes or whatever do a

598
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:14,859
relatively low speed spin at ten

599
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:16,778
thousand times g to again pellet any

600
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:18,759
particles and then the key spin turns

601
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:21,548
out to be at forty thousand times g

602
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:23,679
that's fast enough that pellet vesicles

603
00:26:21,548 --> 00:26:25,359
and then we're curious to see what was

604
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,000
left after that forty thousand times

605
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,740
she's spending a hundred thousand times

606
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,179
g and it turns out there's a lot of

607
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,640
stuff that comes down at a hundred

608
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:35,530
thousand times g and so it's important

609
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,509
not to go straight to a hundred thousand

610
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:38,049
and the reason i mention that is if you

611
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:40,029
read them

612
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:42,069
in literature that standard leaves

613
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:43,779
what's done they do a low-speed spin at

614
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:45,700
ten thousand and then they spin at a

615
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:47,920
hundred thousand if you do that with

616
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:51,309
plant material you'll get a lot of stuff

617
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,200
that you don't want but to really clean

618
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:55,599
it up we take the pellet from forty

619
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,350
thousand times G and run it on a density

620
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:01,629
gradient so this if you look at the

621
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:03,639
pellet from your forty thousand times G

622
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:06,520
spin by transmission electron microscopy

623
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,650
so this is just negative stain you see

624
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:10,990
these structures that look like beanbag

625
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:14,860
chairs and that's essentially what they

626
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:16,450
are because you're you're putting these

627
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:18,969
grids into a vacuum the electron

628
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,950
microscope they collapse and the stain

629
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:24,069
sort of accumulates where it's collapsed

630
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:28,029
but this size range here is around 50 to

631
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:30,759
200 nanometers p100 fraction has all

632
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:33,309
this much smaller material and if you do

633
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:35,950
dynamic light scattering you can see the

634
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:38,319
p40 fraction averages around 120

635
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:40,840
nanometers whereas P 100 fraction is

636
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:44,379
down more around 15 to 20 nanometers I'm

637
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:49,419
so very different size particles but all

638
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:53,500
of our activity is in this P 40 fraction

639
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:55,420
where the best skills are and so we we

640
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,460
were confident that the p40 fraction was

641
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:00,490
what we wanted when we did this

642
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,650
experiment where we isolated that P for

643
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:05,620
diffraction from transgenic plants they

644
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:07,390
had GFP fusions to this pen one protein

645
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:09,429
in the pen three protein so I mentioned

646
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,560
earlier in the talk that Paul Scholten

647
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:15,370
Leafers lab had isolated these plant

648
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:17,230
mutants that had enhanced penetration by

649
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:20,679
powdery barley powdery mildew on

650
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:23,680
Arabidopsis plants so he cloned these

651
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:26,170
pen mutant genes one of them was pen one

652
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,330
and that turned out to encode one of

653
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:30,910
these syntax ins so the proteins

654
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:34,419
involved in membrane fusion and three is

655
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:36,670
an ABC transporter protein they had

656
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,560
shown both of these accumulate in

657
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:40,840
papillae so they seemed to accumulate

658
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,940
outside the plant cell so porosity

659
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:45,699
seemed like good potential biomarkers

660
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,880
for extracellular vesicles and so what's

661
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,970
shown here is the p40 fraction from the

662
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,130
pen one gfp plant by confocal microscopy

663
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,430
I mean it looked like a starry night and

664
00:28:54,130 --> 00:29:00,910
so that was really exciting for us

665
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:03,549
because that really indicated that these

666
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:06,820
vesicles were carrying pen one and pen

667
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:11,230
three and so consistent with our

668
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:13,450
predictions so we wanted to see whether

669
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:15,160
the pen one was really inside the

670
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,319
vesicles which is what we would predict

671
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,150
based on the topology of how these

672
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:21,730
extrasolar vesicles are thought to be

673
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:23,259
produced and so did I say whether

674
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:26,529
they're actually inside versus outside

675
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:29,079
we did a protease protection assay so if

676
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:31,480
you just incubate the vesicles with

677
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:35,109
trypsin you do not see any degradation

678
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:37,180
of the pen one gfp fusion protein if you

679
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:39,159
soluble eyes the vesicles of Triton and

680
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:42,310
entry the trypsin you completely be

681
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,200
grayed so that simply told us that the

682
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:47,980
pin1 protein is actually inside the

683
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:51,130
vesicles not stuck to the outside to

684
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,650
prove to us and our reviewers that we

685
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,840
were not just getting contaminated

686
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:57,610
vesicles from inside plant cells we

687
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:00,449
looked at a series of transgenic

688
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:03,399
Arabidopsis plants tagged with different

689
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:05,590
yfp gfp fusion proteins that marked

690
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,570
different vesicles so this is a marker

691
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:10,209
for Golgi this is a marker for plasma

692
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:12,669
membranes this is a marker for late

693
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,319
endosomes and this is a marker for early

694
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,870
endosomes and so if you look at the

695
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:19,179
total lysate our antibodies detecting

696
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:21,159
all of those proteins you look at the

697
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,640
p40 fraction the only thing that comes

698
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:27,610
out is the pen one protein so these

699
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,009
other common endo membrane marker

700
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:32,769
proteins are not there so this was

701
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:35,769
demonstrated that we would do not have a

702
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:41,799
lot of contamination from vesicles from

703
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:43,809
inside the plant cell we also asked the

704
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:47,019
question would induction of defense

705
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:49,929
responses increased vesicle recovery

706
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:51,849
from our April plastic fluid and the

707
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:54,640
answer was yes so here we use salicylic

708
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:56,769
acid to treat the plants and then we

709
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,110
from the same amount of plant material

710
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:01,389
we isolated mythical x' and then just at

711
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:03,490
a Western blot and you can see a lot

712
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:05,100
more of GFP pen one is what we're

713
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:07,349
looking at here

714
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:09,359
from si treated leaves versus non si

715
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:11,428
treated leaves and then as a second

716
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,678
marker we use their protein that we had

717
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:16,110
identified by mass spec as being present

718
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,870
in the vesicles called Patel and one and

719
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:22,199
that also we could see a lot more Patel

720
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:25,109
in one in our p40 pellet from sa treated

721
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,970
leaves and this is very reproducible we

722
00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:31,288
always get at least twice sometimes

723
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:32,940
three times as many vesicles from plants

724
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:37,019
that have been treated with sa versus

725
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:39,659
untreated okay but what we really wanted

726
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:42,329
to do was to do mass spec on the

727
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:46,019
vesicles and RNA see on the vesicles and

728
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:48,210
so before doing that we decided to take

729
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:51,000
the extra effort of really cleaning them

730
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:53,038
up by using a density gradient and so

731
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,319
what's shown here is a fraction from AIA

732
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:58,169
Dixon all gradient and here's the

733
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:00,808
density of each fraction and this is

734
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:03,269
again GFP pen one as a marker and we can

735
00:32:00,808 --> 00:32:05,278
see that this kind of one peak across

736
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:08,460
the gradient where the GFP pen one shows

737
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:12,298
up so we pull these three fractions and

738
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:13,980
then look at them first by confocal so

739
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:16,079
this is just a black-and-white image of

740
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,849
the confocal you can see the high

741
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,158
concentration of vesicles in these

742
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:22,138
fractions this is what it looks like by

743
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,720
negative stain and this is what it looks

744
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:28,258
like by cry OEM and I don't know if you

745
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,120
can see it but the you can actually see

746
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:32,778
a lipid bilayer when you look at this

747
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:34,888
vesicle down here so this is just

748
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:40,048
convincing ourselves that these really

749
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:41,609
are vesicles and so it was again from

750
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:44,788
this pulled fraction that we went ahead

751
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:47,668
and did mass spec analysis and so when

752
00:32:44,788 --> 00:32:49,829
we do that what we see is a really

753
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:52,288
interesting collection of proteins and

754
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:55,439
it's unlike any other proteome that's

755
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:57,538
been published as far as its mixture of

756
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,070
proteins that are present so first of

757
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:01,048
all there are proteins that we'd expect

758
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:03,359
to be associated with vesicles because

759
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:05,970
these are all social trafficking so Rab

760
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,339
gtp aces regulate and no membrane

761
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:10,190
trafficking Tetris bannon's are well

762
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:13,528
known proteins from the mammalian

763
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:15,480
exosome world syntax ins I've already

764
00:33:13,528 --> 00:33:17,970
been talking about and one of course was

765
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,839
the marker next sentence is another

766
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,370
common class

767
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:22,679
Sabino membrane trafficking proteins

768
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:26,129
that we found and then of interest to

769
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:29,310
the Pseudomonas people here

770
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:32,130
we also found rin for rin for sensor RPM

771
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:35,549
one interacting protein for it's a

772
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,800
really intensely studied protein that as

773
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:40,139
a target of several different effector

774
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:43,200
proteins from Pseudomonas and it seems

775
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:47,280
to be involved in regulating secretion

776
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,900
of Kalos among other activities and so

777
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,170
it was intriguing to us that it was it

778
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:54,240
was in these extra cellar vesicles but

779
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,890
also there were a number of transporter

780
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,750
proteins including glucosinolate

781
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:00,180
transporters which is interesting so

782
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:02,369
rabid abscess glucosinolates are

783
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:05,509
important antimicrobial compounds that

784
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:08,519
brassicas produce there's also

785
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:11,699
aquaporins and proton pumps actually

786
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:13,199
macular ATP ASE's suggesting that these

787
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:18,480
vessels may have some ability to

788
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:21,509
regulate their pH also stress response

789
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,880
proteins lrr protein kinases murasa

790
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:26,130
Nace's is quite interesting Raza noises

791
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:29,039
are enzymes that break down glucose

792
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,720
analytes to release isothiocyanates so

793
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,119
the fact that we have both glucosinolate

794
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,279
transporters and murasa mazes would

795
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,239
suggest that you might be able to

796
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,710
produce these isothiocyanates and one

797
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,169
idea we have is that these might be

798
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:44,490
packaged into separate vesicles because

799
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,500
you probably wouldn't want to put them

800
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:47,789
in the same vesicle because then you'd

801
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,880
be releasing these highly toxic

802
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:53,659
compounds and you probably don't want to

803
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:56,640
do that unless you're inside an insect

804
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:58,289
and you want to kill that insect one

805
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,809
important point about the proteome is

806
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:03,179
that we calculated 84 percent of the

807
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:06,090
proteins we identified lacked a signal

808
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:08,339
peptide so these are proteins are by

809
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,900
definition in April Plast but they're

810
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,820
getting out of the cell through

811
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,260
non-conventional protein secretion and

812
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,990
that makes sense that they're getting

813
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,690
packaged inside vesicles inside the cell

814
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:20,459
so that again suggests that the way

815
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,789
proteins get loaded into these vesicles

816
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:27,559
probably bypasses the standard ER or

817
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:27,559
signal peptide directed pathway

818
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,809
okay so as I mentioned we can also do

819
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:35,390
this from roots and we've done in a lots

820
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:37,040
of different plant species now this one

821
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:39,078
simply shows that if we take soybean

822
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:42,739
roots we can isolate extra cellar

823
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:46,609
vesicles and we use antibody directly to

824
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:48,558
pen one we see abundant pen one in the

825
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:51,078
extracellular vesicles from soybean

826
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:53,690
roots and so this is making us think

827
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,480
that these vesicles may play a role in

828
00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:00,260
regulating interactions in the root

829
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,900
microbiome so that soil interface at

830
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:06,530
roots are secreting vesicles into that

831
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,838
space that may have a lot play a role in

832
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:14,329
communication between microbes in the

833
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:19,338
soil and the roots okay so one of our

834
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:20,839
real foci over the last 12 months has

835
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:23,298
been trying to figure out what sort of

836
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:25,308
RNA these vesicles carry and our first

837
00:36:23,298 --> 00:36:27,858
evidence that they actually did contain

838
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:29,359
RNA came from this experiment here where

839
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:31,068
we're using a dye that was actually

840
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:35,088
developed in the mammalian exposome

841
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:38,449
world to sustain RNA so it's called EXO

842
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:41,588
red and so we just stain our p 4d palate

843
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:45,679
with EXO red we see abundant staining

844
00:36:41,588 --> 00:36:48,889
and we use vesicles that are from a gfp

845
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:51,710
pen one plant we see all the green and

846
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:53,868
what's interesting is there's a high

847
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:57,829
degree of overlap but not a hundred

848
00:36:53,869 --> 00:37:00,440
percent and so these three dots here are

849
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:02,930
white because they show up with EXO red

850
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,269
and they show up with gfp pen one but

851
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:07,219
this dot does not show up with gfp pen

852
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:09,920
one it shows up only with the RNA stain

853
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:11,959
and so this is some evidence that these

854
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,240
vesicles are in fact heterogeneous so

855
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,030
they don't all contain exactly the same

856
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,578
proteins and RNA in fact they're not big

857
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,960
enough that do that even and so we

858
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:25,220
expect to see heterogeneity

859
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,079
but this is a nice evidence of that so

860
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:30,588
we've done RNA seek and we're learning

861
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:33,079
some very interesting things turn the

862
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:34,849
lights up before you all go to sleep

863
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:36,950
so the

864
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:38,779
first thing we've learned and it was

865
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:42,349
kind of surprising to us is that the

866
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:44,150
vesicles are highly enriched in what we

867
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:47,360
are calling tiny RNAs

868
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:50,180
so small are in a world most people talk

869
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,840
about micro RNAs that are 21 nucleotides

870
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:54,949
long

871
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:58,700
and si RNAs are 22 to 24 nucleotides

872
00:37:54,949 --> 00:38:02,059
long we see those but we see a large

873
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:05,299
number of 12 nucleotide 13 nucleotide 14

874
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:07,489
nucleotide 11 nucleotide and so just to

875
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,130
explain the graph here the green bars is

876
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:14,179
the RNA seek data from the extracellular

877
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:16,730
vesicles the blue bars is RNA that we

878
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:19,579
find left over in the supernatant after

879
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:22,699
we spin down that p40 pellet and so

880
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:25,699
there seems to be RNA in extracellular

881
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:29,739
space that doesn't pellet at 40,000

882
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:31,879
times G so it may just be soluble RNA

883
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:33,500
that's out there and how that's getting

884
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,950
out there is an interesting question and

885
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,480
then total RNA is just the small RNA

886
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:42,109
that you get when you grind up a whole

887
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,610
leaf and so this is typically the

888
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:47,570
pattern when you just grind up a whole

889
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:50,780
leaf you know 90% of your RNA secrets

890
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:53,180
are in that 18 and larger size range and

891
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,980
same for the supernatant

892
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:57,349
but that's certainly not true for the

893
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:03,949
Eevee's so v's are preferentially

894
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:07,130
packaging these smaller rnas so what are

895
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:09,349
they targeting well no we expected to

896
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:12,349
see lots of micro rna's and and when we

897
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:14,690
do we we see plenty of micro RNA but as

898
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:17,839
a total fraction of what's in the

899
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:19,909
vesicles it's dwarfed by the SI RNAs

900
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,590
that target transpose ax balem it's so

901
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:24,319
that these are reads that map to

902
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:28,039
transpose element sequences these are

903
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:31,240
reads that map to see DNA's this is some

904
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:33,559
ribosomal RNA and trna gets mapped to

905
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:35,179
precursors refers to micro RNA

906
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:38,840
precursors I think this is quite

907
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:41,629
interesting the V's are highly enriched

908
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:44,510
or the loop that's formed during

909
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:47,150
processing of micro RNA so when you make

910
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:48,559
a micro RNA you know it's transcribed by

911
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,930
polymerase 2

912
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,059
so long precursor it folds up into a

913
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:55,429
stem-loop structure and the micro RNA

914
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:59,109
gets cut out of that stem-loop structure

915
00:39:55,429 --> 00:40:01,639
well these RNAs are in the vesicles

916
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:03,708
preferentially contain the loop from the

917
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:05,420
stem loop structure we don't know what

918
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:09,768
that means yet but we think it might be

919
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:13,400
important this could be taking out the

920
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:14,568
trash but it may also have a function

921
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:19,009
and that's what we're trying to sort out

922
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:20,900
now so I said there are micro rna's and

923
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:24,079
when we look at what the most abundant

924
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,939
ones are they actually differ somewhat

925
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,609
from what the most abundant ones are and

926
00:40:25,938 --> 00:40:33,259
the leaf overall and so this is the list

927
00:40:28,608 --> 00:40:34,938
of our top six based on counts and I've

928
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:40,429
put asterisk by ones that are

929
00:40:34,938 --> 00:40:43,788
particularly interesting and so MRI 162

930
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:46,669
was in the news last summer when it was

931
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:49,969
shown that it's particularly abundant in

932
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:52,338
bee bread so bee bread is concentrated

933
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:54,769
pollen that bees collect and feed their

934
00:40:52,338 --> 00:40:57,159
larvae and the reason that was in the

935
00:40:54,768 --> 00:41:00,889
news is this paper here in PLoS genetics

936
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:02,778
showed that MRI 162 can suppress Queen

937
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:04,268
development and honey bees so in other

938
00:41:02,778 --> 00:41:07,579
words it's important for maintaining

939
00:41:04,268 --> 00:41:10,578
worker status in a honey bee hive and

940
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:13,849
it's being regulated by this plant micro

941
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:17,089
RNA so perhaps pollen is particularly

942
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:19,338
rich in MRI 162 and maybe it's being

943
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:21,739
packaged into vesicles that can be

944
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:27,768
easily taken up by the Queen's I mean by

945
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:30,259
the larvae MRI 159 and 166 those are the

946
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:32,208
RNA micro RNAs I talked about beginning

947
00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:35,778
of the talk that seemed to target genes

948
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:38,748
in verticillium dally I in cotton so it

949
00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:41,208
was the putative targets of these two

950
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:43,368
micro rnas that when they mutated in

951
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:45,108
verticillium may the verticillium more

952
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:46,608
resistant so it's striking that these

953
00:41:45,108 --> 00:41:51,409
happen to be the most abundant ones and

954
00:41:46,608 --> 00:41:53,389
our EBS and then MRI 161 that's a

955
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:55,639
notable micro RNA because it induces

956
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:58,068
production of so-called Phase II RNA so

957
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:01,188
these are si RNAs that are produced in a

958
00:41:58,068 --> 00:42:02,480
phase phased pattern from an individual

959
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:04,670
messenger RNA

960
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,740
and it's been shown in when bomas grew

961
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:09,909
that those actually target specific

962
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:13,099
genes in my father and Almighty pathogen

963
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:15,289
so these are just to suggest that these

964
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:18,349
microRNAs may well have a function in

965
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:21,230
the ABS so are they taken up by the

966
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:23,599
fungus and so here's a really nice

967
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:26,960
experiment that Brian did in which he

968
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:30,440
simply inoculated transgenic plants

969
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,769
expressing pen 3 fused with Gus so pen 3

970
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:37,400
is the possum ABC transporter with

971
00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:39,380
multiple transmembrane domains fused to

972
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,630
beta glucuronidase which you can detect

973
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,599
using a colorless thigh that turns blue

974
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:47,269
in response to the beta glucuronidase so

975
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:49,849
if you this is called dr. comb growing

976
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:52,340
on an Arabidopsis leaf wild-type leaf

977
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:54,079
there's no background activity of beta

978
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,350
glucuronidase that's one of the reasons

979
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,569
it's such a great marker for plants and

980
00:42:56,349 --> 00:43:03,860
you can see accumulation I think here a

981
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:05,930
blue dye in the spores of the contactor

982
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,210
comb that's germinated on this

983
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:10,789
transgenic Arabidopsis plant and the

984
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:13,519
fact that the Gus here is fused to this

985
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:16,070
ABC transporter strongly suggests that

986
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:19,820
the fungus is taking up this plasma

987
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:23,030
membrane protein EB protein from the

988
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,950
host plant you can also do the same

989
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:27,350
experiment of powdery mildew and again

990
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:29,809
you see uptake of the gus activity by

991
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:32,719
the fungus so it really suggests that

992
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:35,139
these eb proteins are getting into the

993
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:37,759
fungi when the fungi feed on the plant

994
00:43:35,139 --> 00:43:39,650
this is simply close up of that last

995
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,720
image of the powdery mildew spore and

996
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:46,700
again you can see it throughout the

997
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:48,649
hyphy so brian then took this call talk

998
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:51,980
to come and simply germinated it on

999
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,389
glass slides and added v's directly to

1000
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,199
the fungus so these are purified

1001
00:43:53,389 --> 00:43:57,259
vesicles

1002
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:59,689
from a pen three gust plant and again

1003
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,430
you can see the blue staining when

1004
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,139
they're germinated in the presence of

1005
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:05,509
the Eevee's and of course no blue

1006
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:07,309
staining at all when you germinate it

1007
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,950
just in the buffer alone without the

1008
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:11,929
eby's there so it looks like the spores

1009
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:14,480
take up these vesicles quite quickly

1010
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:17,019
this is 24 hours after applying the

1011
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,019
vesicles

1012
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:21,858
and so the next question that Brian

1013
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:24,349
wanted to address is do they move

1014
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:27,199
systemically in a plan and to address

1015
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:30,650
that he did graphs with a rabbit ops

1016
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:33,559
Asst and this is not an easy thing to do

1017
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:36,230
because a rabbit ops Asst stems are

1018
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:39,019
really small and so you can't do this

1019
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:41,449
after you've had too much coffee but the

1020
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:45,619
way this does this experiment as he

1021
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:47,899
takes transgenic pen 3 Gus seedlings and

1022
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:49,970
grass shoots to a non-transgenic route

1023
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:52,400
or vice versa transgenic ruth to a

1024
00:44:49,969 --> 00:44:54,949
non-transgenic chute and this looks for

1025
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:59,720
a movement of the gus activity across

1026
00:44:54,949 --> 00:45:02,269
the graph junction and so when you do

1027
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:04,730
that you clearly see movement so this is

1028
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:06,469
wild touch chute grafted on to the

1029
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:08,780
transgenic route here's the graph

1030
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:12,079
junction and you can see this blue color

1031
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:14,090
moving up into the apical meristem

1032
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,739
region of the chute and I'll focus in on

1033
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:18,590
this in a moment because it was a really

1034
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:20,629
interesting pattern up there and it goes

1035
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:22,670
both directions so you take transgenic

1036
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:25,579
chute grafted onto a root and you can

1037
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:27,858
see this root is becoming heavily

1038
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:29,420
stained and it's moving along direction

1039
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:33,049
and this is about three weeks after

1040
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:35,088
setting up the graft do this with

1041
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:37,580
control plants and there's no background

1042
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:41,509
at all so that's can really nice this

1043
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:45,858
guess marker that way if you zoom in

1044
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:48,470
then on these graphs so this is the non

1045
00:45:45,858 --> 00:45:50,779
transgenic shoot what you see is that

1046
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:53,209
Gus activities accumulating and these

1047
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,019
newly emerging leaves and especially in

1048
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:56,240
the trichomes

1049
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:58,130
so these pokey things those are the

1050
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,289
trichomes on these newly emerging leaves

1051
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:02,750
you can also see suddenly Gus activity

1052
00:46:00,289 --> 00:46:04,789
here in the petioles of these older

1053
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:07,849
leaves but that was really interesting

1054
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:09,108
to us that the gus activity seems to be

1055
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,630
preferentially accumulating the

1056
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:15,079
trichomes and trichomes are defensive

1057
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:17,240
structures and one of our hypotheses is

1058
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:19,190
is that these eby's actually serve to

1059
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:20,959
transport glucose in elates because they

1060
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:23,510
have a solute assimilate transporters in

1061
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,699
them and perhaps this is a mechanism for

1062
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:28,800
accumulating glucosinolates into

1063
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:32,000
trichomes they also

1064
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,650
this is now the non-transgenic roots

1065
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,420
grafted to the transgenic shoots you can

1066
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:38,130
see it accumulate in root hairs which is

1067
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:41,820
one of the reasons I think they may well

1068
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:46,470
be involved in communication with the

1069
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:48,269
like the root of microbiome and then as

1070
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:51,059
a negative control what we're currently

1071
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:53,789
using now is a fusion between the jazz

1072
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:57,779
one protein and beta glucuronidase so

1073
00:46:53,789 --> 00:47:00,539
jazz one is a regulator of jazz monarch

1074
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:03,030
acid singling regulates pictu activity

1075
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:05,309
and importantly it mostly accumulates in

1076
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:08,400
the nuclei we have no evidence that ever

1077
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:11,190
gets into extracellular vesicles so it

1078
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,590
shouldn't move via extracellular

1079
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:15,990
vesicles and when we do graphs with that

1080
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:18,930
we see absolutely zero accumulation in

1081
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:23,659
trichomes so this really seems to be

1082
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:23,659
dependent on fusion to this pen 3 probe

1083
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:29,639
so it kind of lastly whether I want to

1084
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:31,739
finish up with is one of the reasons we

1085
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:33,989
set up this whole system is so we could

1086
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:35,639
do genetics with a rabid abscess so we

1087
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:37,259
are now screening through mutants

1088
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:41,069
looking for mutants that are defective

1089
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:43,170
in either Eevee production or in loading

1090
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:45,450
of proteins or RNA into extracellular

1091
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:48,210
vesicles and this is one of our first

1092
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:50,279
kind of positive results and this is

1093
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:53,960
what this shows is that we take a double

1094
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:58,080
mutant in pen one and sip 122 these are

1095
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:59,699
homologous snare proteins what we see is

1096
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,920
that they're defective in loading this

1097
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:03,599
patel and protein into the vesicles i'm

1098
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,090
not showing you the data but this

1099
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,610
mutinous produces the same number of

1100
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:10,530
vesicles as a wild-type plant but it

1101
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:12,750
seems to be defective and produced in

1102
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:14,730
loading in this patel and protein we

1103
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,320
need to do mass spec on this to figure

1104
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:19,230
out what else is missing but we know for

1105
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:21,150
sure this protein is missing you'll

1106
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,920
notice the said 2 mutation is here the

1107
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:24,960
only reason that is there is it turns

1108
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,809
out if you mutate both of these syntax

1109
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,360
ins you turn on sa biosynthesis and you

1110
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:33,329
get a stunted plant and to avoid the

1111
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,820
stunting we needed to down regulate the

1112
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:38,489
sa biosynthesis and so we had to add the

1113
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,900
said 2 mutation but anyway this kind of

1114
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:42,399
gives you an idea of our approach to

1115
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:45,190
start trying to dissect genetically what

1116
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,338
required to produce TVs somewhat to our

1117
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:50,829
surprise so far we we've tested probably

1118
00:48:48,338 --> 00:48:52,449
15 different mutants that are known to

1119
00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:55,568
be defective in different aspects of

1120
00:48:52,449 --> 00:48:56,739
endo membrane trafficking this double

1121
00:48:55,568 --> 00:48:58,480
mutant is the only thing where we've

1122
00:48:56,739 --> 00:49:00,399
seen in effect so far and we haven't

1123
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,719
found a single mutant yet that affects

1124
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:07,088
the number of vesicles that are produced

1125
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:12,639
okay so kind of major questions that

1126
00:49:07,088 --> 00:49:14,650
this work generates are here so these

1127
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,838
multi basic your bodies are destined for

1128
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:19,269
plasma membrane fusion do they

1129
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:21,670
fundamentally differ from those that are

1130
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:24,009
destined for lysosome and Bakula fusion

1131
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:26,318
so for those of you that know a little

1132
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:28,510
bit of cell biology multi basic their

1133
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,849
bodies have classically been studied as

1134
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:32,829
vehicles for transporting plasma

1135
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:36,278
membrane receptors to the central

1136
00:49:32,829 --> 00:49:38,318
vacuole for degradation we think that

1137
00:49:36,278 --> 00:49:41,019
those multi particular bodies are

1138
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:43,808
probably an independent pathway from the

1139
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:46,538
multiply Pacific bodies that go out but

1140
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:49,510
that's not a generally accepted feeling

1141
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:51,190
in the mammalian world but the reason I

1142
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:53,920
believe that's the case least implant

1143
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:56,010
systems is that by EEM the multi

1144
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,809
particular body is like very different

1145
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:01,359
and so if that's the case we need to

1146
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:03,849
figure out really what is the pathway

1147
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:05,710
that gives rise to these MB B's if it's

1148
00:50:03,849 --> 00:50:10,480
completely different from the pathway

1149
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:12,960
that classic MB B's involved so how are

1150
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,880
proteins targeted for import into e B's

1151
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,670
our escort proteins involved our

1152
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,329
autophagy genes involved we really don't

1153
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,789
know yet

1154
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:24,430
certainly some taxons are involved based

1155
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:26,589
on that one result I showed you how are

1156
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:30,068
these small RNAs especially the tiny

1157
00:50:26,588 --> 00:50:31,989
rnase how are they targeted to e B's and

1158
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:34,150
how are they distinguished such a only a

1159
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:36,278
subset of cellular small RNAs or

1160
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:38,650
packaged in two V's I didn't show you

1161
00:50:36,278 --> 00:50:41,500
the data but some micro RNAs are highly

1162
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:45,099
enriched in V's relative to the whole

1163
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:48,329
leaf how are they targeted to specific

1164
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:51,309
recipient cells such as trichomes I

1165
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:52,568
can't think of a mechanism for that it's

1166
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:54,710
gonna be really interesting to try to

1167
00:50:52,568 --> 00:50:56,690
figure that out

1168
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:59,570
are they taken up by fungal cells and

1169
00:50:56,690 --> 00:51:01,820
plant cells we know they're taking up

1170
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:03,470
quickly by these germinating spores how

1171
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:07,039
does that mediate it are there specific

1172
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:09,019
surface proteins required for that do

1173
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:11,329
they media transfer of s RNAs and

1174
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:13,130
proteins into plants based on the gas

1175
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:16,250
they certainly media transport of

1176
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:18,920
proteins we need to actually do some

1177
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:22,070
tests with specific s RNAs to see if we

1178
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,900
can silence specific genes do they

1179
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:27,019
mediate intracellular signalling during

1180
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:29,059
the fence I suspect that they do but we

1181
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:30,800
don't have any evidence for that yet do

1182
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:32,329
they mean into the immediate intranets

1183
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,180
intercellular signaling during

1184
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:38,858
development if they're moving great

1185
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:41,389
distances they probably probably are and

1186
00:51:38,858 --> 00:51:44,088
lastly since this is right before lunch

1187
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:47,230
I'll leave you with this thought do they

1188
00:51:44,088 --> 00:51:49,969
mediate transfer s RNAs into humans and

1189
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:54,199
this isn't just a joke there's actually

1190
00:51:49,969 --> 00:51:58,730
a very active field looking at s plant s

1191
00:51:54,199 --> 00:52:02,739
RNAs in our serum so you eat a bunch of

1192
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:06,050
broccoli in about an hour you will see

1193
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:08,389
broccoli s RNAs in your serum how do

1194
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:11,269
they get there how do they survive your

1195
00:52:08,389 --> 00:52:13,549
digestive system there's pretty good

1196
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:17,509
evidence as probably that sits inside

1197
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:19,430
vesicles what does it mean there's some

1198
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,800
a couple experiments done in mice

1199
00:52:19,429 --> 00:52:24,529
suggesting that actually can influence

1200
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:28,570
gene expression in mice at least when

1201
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:34,760
you introduce these vesicles that carry

1202
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:37,220
si RNAs okay so this final thanks a lot

1203
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,050
of that si RNA analysis we are doing in

1204
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:41,179
collaboration with blake myers at the

1205
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:43,400
donald davenport center and particularly

1206
00:52:41,179 --> 00:52:46,250
patricia Baldrige has really helped out

1207
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,019
with the tiny RNA analysis unfertile

1208
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:49,338
Kristensen has been sending us some of

1209
00:52:48,019 --> 00:52:51,230
his mutants which has been very useful

1210
00:52:49,338 --> 00:52:53,539
and they are now starting to look at

1211
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:55,219
eby's in their lab and it has some

1212
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:57,858
really interesting new data suggesting

1213
00:52:55,219 --> 00:53:01,069
that there's two distinct classes that

1214
00:52:57,858 --> 00:53:03,259
we use based on density if you do the

1215
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,670
density gradient correctly Richard

1216
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,349
O'Connell I showed you that the

1217
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:07,970
beautiful high pressure freezing image

1218
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,740
I'm he's helping us out what they call

1219
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:10,868
talked to come

1220
00:53:08,739 --> 00:53:12,489
and then Josh Blakesley I didn't get a

1221
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:16,240
chance to talk about what he's doing but

1222
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:17,739
he is metabolomic expert and he has been

1223
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:20,229
doing some analyses so look for

1224
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:47,049
glucosinolates and other compounds in

1225
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:48,849
the EBS and I'll stop there and yeah so

1226
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:52,300
so the rudy be the only ones we've

1227
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:54,519
looked at so far from soybean and and

1228
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,760
we've compared the leaf soybean abies to

1229
00:53:54,519 --> 00:54:00,969
the root soybean TVs and they looked

1230
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:02,650
quite similar the soybean eby's

1231
00:54:00,969 --> 00:54:05,889
definitely differ from their rabid ops

1232
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:08,769
ECB's for example there's no

1233
00:54:05,889 --> 00:54:11,920
glucosinolate transporters in soybean

1234
00:54:08,769 --> 00:54:14,380
there were a lot more lipoxygenase --iz

1235
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,150
in the soybean v's than we saw in the

1236
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:18,608
rabbit opposite CDs which could be

1237
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:20,710
interesting but yeah we did not see a

1238
00:54:18,608 --> 00:54:36,460
big difference from root to leaf and

1239
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:39,068
that one data set yeah absolutely and

1240
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:41,769
it's just mentioned the very end that we

1241
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:44,349
are eagerly eagerly awaiting data from

1242
00:54:41,769 --> 00:54:47,139
Josh because that's that's his expertise

1243
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:50,140
and he's particularly interested in

1244
00:54:47,139 --> 00:54:52,269
hormone signaling and he's confident

1245
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:56,588
that they carry oxen so they could be

1246
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:58,119
involved in systemic oxen transport he's

1247
00:54:56,588 --> 00:55:01,630
also going to be looking at the lipid

1248
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:03,160
profiles of the eby's he's got hints

1249
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:05,890
that there are indeed glucosinolates

1250
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:08,199
there but it needs to do a couple more

1251
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:10,808
repeats before we can really start

1252
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:14,068
showing the data but yeah definitely

1253
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:14,069
very interested in the panel

1254
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:43,509
the relief decide about the so so what

1255
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:45,518
we know about that simply is that when

1256
00:55:43,509 --> 00:55:47,920
we look at the proteome content of the

1257
00:55:45,518 --> 00:55:49,389
Eevee's and compared to proteomes that

1258
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,210
have published from other cellular

1259
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:54,879
compartments the most similar proteome

1260
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:56,949
that we could find in the literature was

1261
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,130
so-called detergent-resistant micro

1262
00:55:56,949 --> 00:56:03,460
domains which is a controversial concept

1263
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:05,588
but basically if you purify plasma

1264
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:08,559
membranes and then treat them with a

1265
00:56:05,588 --> 00:56:10,750
detergent and then pellet that's what's

1266
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:13,809
left over so it's the stuff that is

1267
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:16,539
resistant to detergent whether those

1268
00:56:13,809 --> 00:56:20,619
represent contiguous functional domains

1269
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:23,619
is debated but whatever it is that

1270
00:56:20,619 --> 00:56:27,309
renders those plasma membrane regions

1271
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:29,950
resistant detergent those proteins are

1272
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:37,589
highly similar to what we see in the

1273
00:56:29,949 --> 00:56:37,588
extracellular vesicles which would be

1274
00:56:40,018 --> 00:56:46,028
yeah we don't really have a measurement

1275
00:56:43,298 --> 00:56:48,250
of that yet because said these graphs

1276
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:51,608
are just technically challenging to do

1277
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:54,009
so he's only looked at three weeks he

1278
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:55,869
hasn't looked at a week in two weeks in

1279
00:56:54,009 --> 00:56:57,880
three weeks but that's on our list of

1280
00:56:55,869 --> 00:57:00,640
experiments to do but clearly it's

1281
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,880
traveled a long ways by three weeks so I

1282
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:06,578
would guess it's probably you know the

1283
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:08,920
seedlings are tiny when you do the graft

1284
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:11,950
and so I would suspect after a day

1285
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:19,240
they've already moved across and spread

1286
00:57:11,949 --> 00:57:25,298
but that's just speculation the Eevee's

1287
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:27,699
get out my cell wall do you have any

1288
00:57:25,298 --> 00:57:29,469
feeling for what percentage but the

1289
00:57:27,699 --> 00:57:32,409
totally beads that are available are

1290
00:57:29,469 --> 00:57:34,759
within the tissue or pharmacist in April

1291
00:57:32,409 --> 00:57:36,289
class flushing

1292
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,450
and the third is it be considered using

1293
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:47,329
like protoplasm but several there any

1294
00:57:38,449 --> 00:57:49,969
enzyme to release right so so we really

1295
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:52,099
have no good measurement of what

1296
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:54,099
fraction of the EVs we're getting

1297
00:57:52,099 --> 00:57:56,929
through our cell wall washing procedure

1298
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:59,000
we haven't like gone back and done a.m.

1299
00:57:56,929 --> 00:58:00,829
on the vacuum infiltrated leaves what

1300
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,690
you could probably do but you've not

1301
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:04,549
done that site I can't really answer

1302
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:09,320
that question my intuition is we're

1303
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:12,830
probably not getting a large percent how

1304
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:15,470
they get to the cell wall I mean so

1305
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:18,590
while it's a complex mesh and it's

1306
00:58:15,469 --> 00:58:20,899
probably not uniform pore size and so I

1307
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:24,108
suspect that they they just wiggle

1308
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:25,940
through the evidence to support that

1309
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:30,019
there's actually a pretty recent paper

1310
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:32,630
with the fungal cell wall showing that

1311
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:37,460
the they were using some sort of marker

1312
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:39,050
protein and just showing that mark these

1313
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:41,780
marker protein when it was put in to

1314
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:44,000
sense the artificial vesicles could

1315
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:46,880
easily be crossing the fungal cell wall

1316
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,369
and getting into the fungus where nobody

1317
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,260
expected it could so there was something

1318
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:53,090
about just being in a vesicle that

1319
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:55,609
allowed uptake by the fungus quite

1320
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:56,980
rapidly and so I imagine the same thing

1321
00:58:55,608 --> 00:58:59,119
could be happening with the plant cell

1322
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:01,969
so we don't understand the physics of

1323
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:05,150
that protoplast stain we've talked about

1324
00:59:01,969 --> 00:59:06,949
it but we haven't actually done it the

1325
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:09,500
one thing that we have done is fiddled

1326
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:12,529
with the pH of the extraction buffer and

1327
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:14,599
it does so we'd standardly use I think

1328
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:18,200
it's pH six because we were just trying

1329
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:20,210
to be as gentle as possible to the April

1330
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:23,179
Plast and not cause any sort of

1331
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:25,340
artificial things but Brian did do a pH

1332
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:27,139
for extraction once and his sense was

1333
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:29,180
they got about twice as many vesicles

1334
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:31,389
out so it may help to loosen up the cell

1335
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:31,389
wall

1336
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:43,140
