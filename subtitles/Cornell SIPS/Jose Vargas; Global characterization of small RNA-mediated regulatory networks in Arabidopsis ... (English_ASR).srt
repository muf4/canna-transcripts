1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,559
I'd like to introduce Jose Vargas he

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,059
comes to us from Costa Rica where he

5
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,600
studied at the University of Costa Rica

6
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:21,179
he contacted me about six years ago and

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,250
after a number of communications he was

8
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:29,699
admitted and here he is um I asked Jose

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,878
to work on a number of virus projects I

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,009
should preface that by saying he he's

11
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:38,818
wanted to come here to pursue interests

12
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,710
in biology and bioinformatics so he

13
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:43,769
worked on a number of virus systems I

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,939
asked him to set up a system to allow us

15
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:49,378
to use large-scale sequencing

16
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:50,628
technologies for Diagnostics he has done

17
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,338
that over the last few years

18
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:56,399
additionally he's making uses the same

19
00:00:53,338 --> 00:01:00,119
technologies to address some questions

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,268
regarding the host response the smaller

21
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:05,819
a response to virus infection and today

22
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:08,870
he'll be talking about the

23
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:14,368
bioinformatics efforts he's made to

24
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,960
analyze networks of small RNAs in the

25
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:19,409
interest of time he will not be

26
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:23,368
discussing much about the biology per se

27
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:29,609
but the best is still to come so with

28
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:32,519
that as an introduction Jose okay yep

29
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:34,169
okay I think you'll for coming I was

30
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,759
very happy to have the opportunity to

31
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:41,490
tell you about what I've been doing for

32
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:43,200
the last five years or so so excuse

33
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,239
mention I've sort of been involved in

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,579
two different lines of research on the

35
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,489
one hand we've been looking we've been

36
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:52,139
conducting products that involve virus

37
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,078
and virus detection and characterization

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,349
and this involves all the published

39
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:00,089
works so far and even though I've taken

40
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:02,908
some time I only have one slide to show

41
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,009
for today which is a summary of what we

42
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,819
publish you can see here we've been

43
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,460
working on

44
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:10,920
spinach latent virus of tomato we've

45
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,950
also work on to viral grade by virus

46
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,079
Grapevine virus II and great band

47
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:20,179
asteroid mistake associated virus and

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,060
also one viroid in Grapevine

49
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,129
and that's it for pathology now I'm

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,280
gonna move through my main thesis

51
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:30,219
project I'm sorry about that

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,599
where we are focusing on the question

53
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:35,150
this is the question we're focusing on

54
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,219
what is the role of small RNA mediated

55
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,550
regulatory networks in host virus

56
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:42,979
interactions so just to get it out there

57
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,420
I'm gonna show you my objectives they

58
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:45,859
may not make full sense right now but

59
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:47,449
hopefully through the interaction

60
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,520
through the interaction they will I just

61
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:52,099
want you to know where I'm going so I

62
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,620
have two objectives what I want to do is

63
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:56,810
to identify and describe biologically

64
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,909
relevant small RNA mediated regulatory

65
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,770
networks and once I have them to

66
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:04,310
determine the regulatory contribution of

67
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,500
the resulting networks now going back to

68
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,500
my main questions there are three teams

69
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,810
here that I would like to address small

70
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,789
RNAs networks and host virus

71
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,129
interactions and I'll start with the

72
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:20,150
interactions so when you think about a

73
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:24,739
virus some may think about this but this

74
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:26,750
is you see it yeah this is actually a

75
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:30,560
variant a very own is an infectious

76
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:32,300
particle a virus is better thought of as

77
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,129
an infective cell where you have a whole

78
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,810
complement of proteins that are not

79
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:39,169
present in the variant but are required

80
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:42,590
for to complete the virus replication

81
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:44,149
cycle so the viruses as you know they

82
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,789
hijack the cell metabolism

83
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:49,670
therefore they interact at many levels

84
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:52,250
with their host today I'm going to be

85
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:55,280
focusing in a series of interactions

86
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,719
involved in immune responses so in this

87
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,459
diagram here I'm showing the virus

88
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,530
replication cycle from virus entry

89
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:08,300
genome decap sedation viral replication

90
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:10,219
and synthesis viral proteins and on the

91
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:15,140
Left I'm showing a diagram that is

92
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:17,209
familiar to most people here where viral

93
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:19,668
products can be recognized by pattern

94
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,569
recognition receptors in the case of

95
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:23,449
plant viruses there would be

96
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:27,189
intracellular and they can trigger a PGI

97
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:30,800
base response I suspected virus encode

98
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:33,408
effectors that can block the pti

99
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,499
response and consequently

100
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:38,808
the hose has evolved resistance genes

101
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:43,338
that can recognize these viral proteins

102
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:46,429
and trigger an epi response this is

103
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:49,368
quite common female pathology now in

104
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:50,598
viruses there's also but we think it's

105
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:53,479
something we think of us adaptive

106
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:55,819
immunity where viral products can be

107
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,399
recognized by its host protein to launch

108
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:00,908
an adaptive immune response that is

109
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:04,728
affected by RNA I or RNA interference

110
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:06,588
now so the main takeaway here is that

111
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:10,449
RNA interference is involved in

112
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:14,360
antiviral defense and just as a reminder

113
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:17,838
RNA interference RNA AI or RNA silencing

114
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,809
refers to multiple biogenesis pathways

115
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:23,059
that I've shown here in boxes the lead

116
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:27,349
to the production of small RNAs which

117
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:27,860
are molecules of 21 to 24 nucleotides

118
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:30,158
long

119
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,209
that are involved in transcriptional

120
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:35,329
translational or process scription or

121
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:39,139
regulation and they're quite important

122
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:41,929
they've been even people like to call

123
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,939
the master regulators and their activity

124
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:47,478
has been described in multiple cellular

125
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:49,729
systems and in multiple settler

126
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:52,008
processes in various systems here I'm

127
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:55,188
showing examples where Micronesia refers

128
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:59,629
to as massive regulators in humans plans

129
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:01,419
and drosophila so white flies and in

130
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:04,278
these systems have been related to

131
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:05,899
regulation in cancer development for our

132
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:08,418
cases plan defense response is quite

133
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:12,468
important and also gene immiscibility

134
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:15,198
now small rnas are also in discovering

135
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:17,899
plans to act through regulatory networks

136
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,218
again I'm showing here several examples

137
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:22,848
that show

138
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:25,459
smaller networks involved in development

139
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:29,118
trade dominance in overall gene

140
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:31,848
expression so hopefully at this point of

141
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,449
convince you that this small rnas are

142
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:37,519
quite important regulators and that they

143
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:39,949
collectively form regulatory networks

144
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:44,329
involved in multiple processes like

145
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:47,000
defense development stress now if we go

146
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:51,590
back to this plot I would like to

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,509
point this set of proteins years that

148
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:56,179
are known as viral silencing suppressors

149
00:06:53,509 --> 00:07:00,439
so these are proteins encoded in the

150
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:03,980
virus that are able to block RNA i or

151
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:07,430
RNA interference so when you think when

152
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,410
you remember I just sort of went through

153
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,019
the relevance of RNA interference for

154
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,760
regular cell metabolism and viruses

155
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:16,669
interference could have a great effect

156
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,230
and in fact I don't have the time today

157
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,980
to tell you mechanistically how this

158
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:24,560
occurred but the viruses of suppressors

159
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,439
can act by interfering with the small

160
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,810
RNA biogenesis they can also sequestered

161
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,430
these molecules making them unavailable

162
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,769
for their action and they can also

163
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,530
interfere with the proteins involved in

164
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:39,109
the pathways now to remember that the

165
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:41,119
pathways involved in antiviral refunds

166
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,189
defense and regular cell metabolisms

167
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,389
have a lot of common factors so this

168
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:49,339
viral interference could have a great

169
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:54,289
effect on the plant and we I'm gonna

170
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:56,959
show one example here where I'm showing

171
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,610
our ovide of these plants expressing

172
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,789
well transgenic be expressed in

173
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,860
different viral silencing suppressors

174
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,840
from different viruses so on the left

175
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,680
this is how a healthy plant would look

176
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:11,029
and this are not virus infected plants

177
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,829
they're only expressing this virus

178
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:17,228
suppressor proteins and you can see that

179
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:19,219
the effect is quite dramatic so

180
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:20,959
something that if could be of interest

181
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,760
is that financing suppressors are not

182
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,939
exclusive to viruses there are also

183
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:29,060
known examples in bacterial pathogen

184
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:31,969
pseudomonas syringae is well study model

185
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:35,658
where we've some of the proteins have

186
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:37,729
been described or involved in silencing

187
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:41,288
suppressor also there's a known amaizing

188
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,788
pathogen bite after SOG that encodes

189
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:47,179
what appears to be multiple silencing

190
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:50,179
suppressors so this convergence appears

191
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:52,429
to indicate that the small RNA silencing

192
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:56,509
could be a play a very relevant role in

193
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:59,149
plan defense now with this in mind and

194
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:00,830
thinking that small Ernest or master

195
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:02,600
regulators of defense

196
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,660
and that they've worked through

197
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,930
regulatory networks we developed this

198
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:10,610
main research questions number one what

199
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:13,569
is the role of small RNA mediated

200
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:17,600
networks in immunity for our purposes

201
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:19,400
viral infection and given the existence

202
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,850
of these common factors between smaller

203
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,559
Naevia Genesis and defense you also have

204
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,840
the next question which is what is the

205
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,689
effect of viral silencing suppressors in

206
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,960
hos small RNA mediated regulatory

207
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,870
networks now to study this our model is

208
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,820
kokuboro mosaic virus or CMV here I'm

209
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:42,470
showing a diagram of his genome there's

210
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,090
three rnas and over here this earth to B

211
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,590
corresponds to the protein that is

212
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:49,370
involved in the Health Sciences

213
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:52,600
suppressor activity so we've developed a

214
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,860
couple of mutants for this protein and

215
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,550
we infected are available sister Lyanna

216
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:01,340
plans so here I'm showing the phenotypes

217
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:04,219
after three weeks or three weeks post

218
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:07,040
inoculation on the top we have to mark

219
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,170
plan so this should be uninfected second

220
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,809
name corresponds to clients infected

221
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:14,569
with a wild-type version of CMV and then

222
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:17,449
the two lower panels corresponds to

223
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,220
trans infected with the mutated version

224
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,550
of this virus and you can see they're

225
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,710
pretty much asymptomatic now in case you

226
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:26,569
were wondering we do know that the virus

227
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:30,019
is replicating because we can detect the

228
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:32,690
coat protein in all plants and just as a

229
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:35,029
controlled we do not detect the sinus

230
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:38,990
repressor protein in our mutants as

231
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:42,829
expected now this is our experimental

232
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:44,960
system now let's just I'm gonna go back

233
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,400
and review what we know about smaller

234
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,769
and a revelatory networks in a bit more

235
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,289
detail and just to get our terms right a

236
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:53,509
network is a set of nodes connected by a

237
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:55,849
set of edges in here I'm showing the

238
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:58,490
nodes in blue which for my presentation

239
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:01,009
corresponds to RNAs can be smaller nasal

240
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:04,519
transcripts and the green corresponds to

241
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:07,100
the edges that in my case corresponds to

242
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,629
the interaction between the nodes I've

243
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,190
already shown that they're involved in

244
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:14,600
multiple processes and now most of these

245
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,210
networks are composed by

246
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,300
pairs of micro RNA and face small RNA

247
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,280
interfering RNAs now what do I mean by

248
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:24,019
that

249
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,199
here I'm showing the biogenesis pathway

250
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:30,769
for micro rna's so they are expressed

251
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,810
from a gene the transcript is processed

252
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:35,360
by dice or like proteins into smaller

253
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:39,109
neighs they're then sorted and loaded

254
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,080
into a go containing complexes and this

255
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,480
complexes are the effector molecules

256
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,389
that will lead to mRNA degradation or

257
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,060
translational repression now in some

258
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:53,149
cases there's a different outcome the

259
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:55,009
micro RNA will target a transcript and

260
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:56,840
instead of leaving leading to cleavage

261
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:59,779
it leads to the production of

262
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,810
double-stranded RNA that is then cleaved

263
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:05,689
by dicing like proteins to produce phase

264
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:09,079
small RNAs now it's not really evidence

265
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:11,090
in the diagram here but the named phase

266
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,220
small RNAs refers to the fact that these

267
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,350
double stranded RNAs are cleave

268
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,930
sequentially by decisive produce to

269
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,350
produce smaller anaise in tandem there

270
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:22,909
are 21 nucleotides long

271
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,820
now these small RNAs are also loaded

272
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:27,769
into other containing complexes that can

273
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,480
then have an effect on a regulatory

274
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:34,730
effect on their targets now I'm going to

275
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:39,860
translate this diagram into a network

276
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:41,779
view and again here we have two micro

277
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,659
nice they can target transcripts lead to

278
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:47,029
degradation sometimes they will lead to

279
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:50,779
the production of face smaller nice or

280
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:54,309
fuzzy RNAs and this some have no

281
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:58,360
activity some can target order

282
00:12:54,309 --> 00:13:01,519
transcripts some can even target its own

283
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,830
transcript or lead to secondary

284
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,590
production of small RNAs so this creates

285
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,180
a cascade effect where the amount of

286
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,990
information carry for the initial

287
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:14,659
molecule grows very quickly now again to

288
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,759
go back to the terms in this case my

289
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:18,589
molecules here corresponds to the nodes

290
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:23,840
and the edges are the interactions

291
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:26,840
between these molecules back to

292
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:30,440
review we have a very well study example

293
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:35,120
in a cascade that initiates with micro

294
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,910
RNA 173 and smaller nays that derive

295
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,320
from it but then I'm going to go through

296
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:42,799
in some detail because I'm going to use

297
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:47,360
it as an example and control later on so

298
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:51,740
if you have heard of it if you know it

299
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:55,789
near 173 was described about ten years

300
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,019
ago and it leads to this cascade of

301
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:59,539
Tassie RNAs

302
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:02,240
Tasi rnase refers to transact in small

303
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:05,149
interfering RNAs which was just a first

304
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,080
class of face-it small interfering RNAs

305
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:12,019
so tasse is a subset of fatty RNAs

306
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,139
just in case it can be confusing now in

307
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:17,659
this diagram what I'm showing it's

308
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:20,750
transcripts in blue ovals and small RNAs

309
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:23,319
in orange rectangles so there's an

310
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:27,470
initial transcripts that give rise to

311
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,870
mature micro RNA targets that test to

312
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,970
transcripts to produce in this case

313
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,220
they're actually several small RNAs I'm

314
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,529
just showing one that it's a particular

315
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,870
interest because it targets another gene

316
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:42,949
but it also leads to the production of

317
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:44,629
secondary RNAs that can then go on and

318
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,400
target others transcripts this is an

319
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:50,450
example of how this cascade effect would

320
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:54,069
work now over the years this cascade has

321
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:57,200
been growing and this could represent

322
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,790
one of the more recent views of how this

323
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,090
may work now

324
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:04,579
I'm showing a similar structure so we

325
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:08,210
have a micro RNA here in the middle set

326
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:10,670
targets in this case for low side which

327
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:13,580
are in the middle of these clusters that

328
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:16,789
produce fuzzy RNAs which are the little

329
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,310
balls around each cluster now this was a

330
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:22,819
very nice study because they were able

331
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:25,789
to link this regulatory cascade to

332
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,980
metabolic stress which provide

333
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:29,809
functionality for it

334
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,670
now I must say that their analysis is

335
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:34,069
restricted to a known class of

336
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:36,139
micronation classes so we knew about

337
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,879
these interactions they just expanded on

338
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:40,569
them

339
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:43,210
and then they performed by informatica

340
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:47,650
target prediction for all this small RNA

341
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:51,190
and performed target violation on a few

342
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:53,259
selected targets of interest so they not

343
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,570
doing a whole genome-wide study they're

344
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:56,110
just looking at a particular cascade of

345
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,750
interest

346
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,029
now there is one precedent of a genome

347
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,879
wide view of regulatory networks by

348
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:08,319
small RNAs which was performed by David

349
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:10,360
Balkans group around 2010 and where they

350
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,580
are looking from a genome-wide

351
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,350
perspective and they provided the

352
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:18,580
initial description of smaller na

353
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:20,110
mediated networks they did some

354
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,610
structured analysis they were thinking

355
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,159
about it from a network's point of view

356
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:27,190
and it's a really nice paper which

357
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:29,469
reflects the overall potential of this

358
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,560
regulatory networks but we can really

359
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,810
assess the biological significance of it

360
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:37,389
because they did not account for

361
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:39,099
different types of small RNAs and the

362
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:41,799
fact that most of them that you find in

363
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,740
a library are not active and they did

364
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:47,379
not do any validation for their edges

365
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:52,180
it's all bioinformatics or acidic

366
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:54,639
prediction so with this in mind and

367
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:56,500
going back to my main question of what

368
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,529
is the role of small RNA mediated

369
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,389
networks in immunity when thinking about

370
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:03,189
how to conduct this project and what we

371
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:07,660
need I came up with a set of

372
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:09,730
requirements for the network's that we

373
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,310
would use or a reference frame to study

374
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,709
that should be biologically relevant it

375
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:17,198
should be experimental support for it

376
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:20,589
should be reproductive or reproducible

377
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,360
and when going down the list and

378
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:24,068
thinking about what's known so far we

379
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,469
realize we don't have an appropriate

380
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:28,690
framework to do this comparison so

381
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,700
unfortunately we don't have enough

382
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,340
information to address this question and

383
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,890
at this point we decided well we could

384
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:40,349
try something else or we can do it

385
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:42,450
ourselves so coming up we

386
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:44,759
reference frame to study small RNA

387
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,788
regulation became a main thesis project

388
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:52,139
which was to produce a model network of

389
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:54,240
small RNA interactions now admittedly I

390
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:56,638
did not have a background and program in

391
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,099
a computational biology at the time but

392
00:17:56,638 --> 00:18:00,658
it was a pretty smooth process I don't

393
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:03,509
know why people complain a lot it was

394
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:08,480
mostly inconsequential it seemed to just

395
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:11,610
go right there's no problem to it so

396
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,409
I'll go back to my objectives as sqeeze

397
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:16,308
mentioned my objectives will reflect the

398
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:18,120
fact that the part with virology it's

399
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:19,589
over at this point of the presentation

400
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:22,138
if you were hoping to hear more about

401
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:24,658
viruses please wait until the next time

402
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:27,119
because by now I'm going to focus on the

403
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:28,919
networks and mostly I'm gonna focus on

404
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,158
identifying and describing biologically

405
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,528
relevant small RNA mediated networks and

406
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,610
determining the regulatory contribution

407
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:37,859
then again this is to provide a

408
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:41,038
reference frame so that we can go back

409
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:41,990
to study the effect of virus in these

410
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,490
systems

411
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:47,009
now I'm gonna first describe the

412
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:52,528
approach I took to identify this smaller

413
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:54,750
in a mediated networks so step one is to

414
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:57,628
produce a model network for a lab adopts

415
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,759
italiana the model network with I then

416
00:18:57,628 --> 00:19:02,819
will involve identifying all nodes and

417
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,980
known and all edges once we have this

418
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:07,528
basically have a map of all possible

419
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,370
interactions using this reference frame

420
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:13,169
we can then input expression data to

421
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:18,869
produce sample or treatment specific

422
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:20,850
networks so that's the plan now to do

423
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:23,128
this if I go back to my diagram of

424
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:24,719
components because we're working at our

425
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:26,250
top sister Lyanna we know a lot or

426
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,100
there's a lot of background information

427
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:31,980
so the latest annotation of our adop's

428
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:36,119
is enum is named arab port 11 and it was

429
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:39,538
produced in 2016 last year and from here

430
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:41,548
we can get all known microRNAs and

431
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:44,970
target transcripts it's a pretty full

432
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:48,240
annotation and for the rest of the

433
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:52,610
molecules i had to come up with a by

434
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,940
informatics tool and a few data sets to

435
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,859
get all

436
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,798
information I'll get into the details of

437
00:19:55,859 --> 00:20:02,638
the Davises in a minute now slice for

438
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:04,679
phase 1 for phase 2 then we need which

439
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:06,329
phase 2 is a quantification part we

440
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:10,669
would use smaller and AC you can only

441
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:14,278
seek to count or provide a quantum I

442
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:17,549
quantitative side to it now for data at

443
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:21,148
position if you remember I need three

444
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:23,369
type of data I'm trying to get small

445
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:26,699
RNAs which are produced by a small RNA

446
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:28,859
seek RNA seek to get all the transcripts

447
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,100
information I'll describe the rhythm

448
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:35,459
datasets in a minute now to obtain all

449
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:36,959
these molecules or these data sets we as

450
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,240
I mentioned before we have an experiment

451
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,460
with our adopts italiana from which we

452
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,929
get total RNA and from that total RNA

453
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:48,720
sample we produce these three datasets

454
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:50,909
now hopefully the first two are familiar

455
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,379
I'll take a minute to describe take a

456
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:53,759
some library because actually quite

457
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:56,638
important for the purposes of this

458
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,960
presentation so Dagenham library or

459
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:59,579
taking up data is what we use to

460
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,319
validate our edges which are the

461
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:04,349
interactions between small rnas and

462
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:06,720
transcripts and it's a two-step process

463
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:07,500
we first do a projection of all the

464
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,190
cleavage sites

465
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:13,288
now here I'm Illustrated a messenger RNA

466
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,929
we find regions where small RNAs can

467
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:18,599
target and use because we know how they

468
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:21,929
act we can predict how a cleavage

469
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:25,069
transcript would look then we move on to

470
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:28,379
experimental validation we're using

471
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:33,148
molecular methods we clone and sequence

472
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:35,158
all degraded RNAs and then we look for

473
00:21:33,148 --> 00:21:37,678
accumulation of five prime terminal tax

474
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,629
of these sequences at the predicted

475
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,038
cleavage site which basically means we

476
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:44,398
look at our sequencing data and

477
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:49,429
determine if we can find molecules that

478
00:21:44,398 --> 00:21:52,018
would fit our prediction now the

479
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:53,909
validation process or how we examine

480
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,038
this result is a I don't really have

481
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:58,350
time to describe it in full but it's a

482
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:02,669
process is a quantitative assessment

483
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:04,288
that involves statistical model so the

484
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:06,600
take-home message is that we have

485
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,740
experimental validation for all of the

486
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,769
edges interactions

487
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,259
networks that I'm going to present and

488
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:16,019
also we do this so we can sort of

489
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,990
network has that we can do biologically

490
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:21,150
relevant inferences from n networks now

491
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,759
just to remind you because this is gonna

492
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,710
be important and I'm gonna go back and

493
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,390
forth between these terms when I talk

494
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,789
about decadal data I'm talking about

495
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,770
experimental validation of smaller

496
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:35,519
nativist of a transcript which in our

497
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:37,200
networks corresponds to the edges now

498
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,920
just a quick comment about the data

499
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,360
acquisition we make our own libraries in

500
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,360
the lab in case someone is interested in

501
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,009
this for RNA seek is the only one where

502
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,229
we use a kid but we still make them in

503
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:52,019
the lab and the other two data sets are

504
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,789
produced by somehow hybrid methodologies

505
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:56,250
from ginger man on his lab in our

506
00:22:53,789 --> 00:23:00,409
publications that we've adapted to her

507
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:03,210
on that now for the bioinformatics tool

508
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:06,090
when I was thinking about how to present

509
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,740
this I was reminded about this Italian

510
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:10,199
researcher the Davis seminar in the fun

511
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,299
biology seminar seminar serious a couple

512
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,460
of weeks ago and she had a great comment

513
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,960
and I quote she said that when

514
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,029
describing your buying formatic

515
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,350
pipelines to your colleagues it's like

516
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:23,460
showing pictures on your kids to your

517
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:25,319
friends no one cares even though you

518
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,049
want to show them every detail and you

519
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:30,240
think you're writing a symphony it's

520
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:33,419
just I don't know I think someone may

521
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,089
care and if you do I'm happy to tell you

522
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:40,350
about it but I'm just gonna summarize my

523
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:43,019
tool in one slide I made this by

524
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:45,899
informatics Python or tool that has

525
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:48,990
several modules that are made to find

526
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,179
all the nodes in my networks and I'm

527
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,130
making use of existing tools I've also

528
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:57,750
modified some of them and I created my

529
00:23:53,130 --> 00:24:01,290
own and the same strategy for the edges

530
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:03,329
so then my tool breaks all the notes and

531
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:06,149
I just together to produce my smaller

532
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:10,220
and a regulatory networks so that wasn't

533
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:15,480
too painful I hope now another reminder

534
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:17,190
when looking for all analyzing my data

535
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,500
and trying to identify all the

536
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,980
components in my networks remember I'm

537
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,130
trying to produce

538
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,910
Network which involves all nodes or

539
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,530
small rnas and transcripts and all edges

540
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:31,750
in this process I realized that the

541
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:35,379
identification is data intensive and

542
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:37,869
most importantly the identification

543
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:41,020
depends on expression and the expression

544
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:43,659
of the small rnas could depend on

545
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:45,690
developmental stages the tissue type you

546
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,730
used to make your collection or

547
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,130
environmental cues such as stress so to

548
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:54,579
account for this I produce my own data

549
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:57,370
sets and also went back to databases so

550
00:24:54,579 --> 00:25:00,189
this is a summary of the data use for

551
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:02,199
small RNA libraries I made 14 smaller

552
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,630
than any libraries from a reveal of 6

553
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:10,150
plants that were infected or not with

554
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:13,210
CMV and also I got 38 data sets

555
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:15,040
available at the NCBI database that

556
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,740
corresponds to wild-type arrival of

557
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,298
these plants and this was very useful

558
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,190
because there are drops is there's a lot

559
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:25,179
of background information and I was able

560
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:27,759
to find datasets corresponding to just

561
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:30,370
wall type healthy plants also hormone

562
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:33,900
treated and I've shown an example of

563
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:36,250
metabolic stress I've also have

564
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,400
libraries from different tissue sources

565
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:41,410
and also plants have been challenged by

566
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:45,040
pathogens including viruses and

567
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:49,179
nematodes now for the diadem libraries I

568
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:52,178
had the same strategy oh I produce 16

569
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:55,360
data sets but they're only 5 available

570
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:59,590
at NCBI and they corresponds to in

571
00:25:55,359 --> 00:26:02,889
fluorescence and season Institute's now

572
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:07,000
ok so that is the setup let's take a

573
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:09,730
look at the results just to remind you

574
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,940
I'm trying to identify these networks or

575
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:15,279
smaller in a regulatory networks and

576
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,650
from my diagram the missing components

577
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,918
are the fuzzy low side that corresponds

578
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:23,580
to the transcripts that produce fancy

579
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:27,040
rnas which are the other missing parts

580
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:28,869
so the identification of these

581
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,629
components is performed using smaller

582
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:34,178
names information and this is a summary

583
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,759
of all the libraries that I use so in

584
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:37,609
the

585
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:40,190
x-axis is the name of the library the

586
00:26:37,608 --> 00:26:42,678
identification for the library that said

587
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:45,259
on the Left corresponds to this study or

588
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:48,619
the ones I produced oh and the y axis

589
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:51,739
corresponds to millions of reads then in

590
00:26:48,618 --> 00:26:54,468
black I'm showing the total yield of the

591
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:57,709
sequencing project when available in

592
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:59,899
blue I'm showing the imaan of all the

593
00:26:57,709 --> 00:27:03,320
reads are actually usable or pass filter

594
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:05,748
and what I'm trying to communicate here

595
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:06,888
is that the libraries are varied right

596
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:10,909
some are really good some are not

597
00:27:06,888 --> 00:27:13,668
they're hard to evaluate so we take that

598
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:15,528
into account in our analysis now to find

599
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:19,009
those fancy low so which is the first

600
00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:21,919
step I took each library and tried to

601
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:26,298
identify these regions using an existing

602
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,519
tool called face tank and the idea is

603
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:31,219
that I identified all the regions in all

604
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:33,618
my libraries and then I summarized the

605
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:37,308
results to produce a consensus fuzzy

606
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:40,038
locus and these are the results again so

607
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:42,528
here what I'm showing is fuzzy low side

608
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:46,398
detection so regions that produce face

609
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:48,979
small rnas libraries are on the x axis

610
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:51,498
and on the y axis is the number of

611
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:53,899
detection events so how many fancy Lassa

612
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:55,989
I detect per library and you can see

613
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:58,248
again the results are varied and

614
00:27:55,989 --> 00:28:02,119
actually our libraries were pretty good

615
00:27:58,249 --> 00:28:05,389
for detecting facil also you can see

616
00:28:02,118 --> 00:28:09,288
some just provided no results at all now

617
00:28:05,388 --> 00:28:12,408
the next step is to produce a consensus

618
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:14,328
low side so here is a summary which

619
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:16,699
basically represents repeatability how

620
00:28:14,328 --> 00:28:19,989
many times a region is found to be a

621
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:23,599
producer of a CRNAs across libraries I

622
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:26,989
found 92 regions represented here in the

623
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:29,418
x-axis in the y axis is the number of

624
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:32,690
times that region is recognized across

625
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:34,999
libraries and you can see that most of

626
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:38,778
them or a good amount of them are found

627
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:41,269
multiple times but some have found in a

628
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:43,489
very few occasions even just one time or

629
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:46,489
in one in a single library and this

630
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:47,850
could represent false positives or they

631
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:50,009
cross so just

632
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:51,839
percent regions that are expressed only

633
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:57,150
under a particular circumstance

634
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:59,189
now she remember my diagram Vasilisa are

635
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,530
the regions that produce a small rnas

636
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:05,160
and we can test the activity of the

637
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:08,399
small rnas using Tegaderm data so I use

638
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:11,940
this to validate this previous set of

639
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,910
results by asking the question do the

640
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:18,509
small RNAs that derive from this loss I

641
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:22,350
have biological activity assessed by

642
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:24,629
Dagenham data and now I have this

643
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:27,599
reduced subset of fifty regions from

644
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,490
which I have from which smaller nice

645
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:33,058
they're smaller nice derive from them

646
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:35,130
actually have value-added targets and if

647
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:35,730
you're wondering where are they or what

648
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,799
they are

649
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:41,220
most of them corresponds to annotated

650
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:45,240
regions in the genome that correspond to

651
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,640
coding genes and for our purposes

652
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,370
they're of great interest because a lot

653
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,850
of defense related genes are known to

654
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:57,239
produce small RNAs so the most evident

655
00:29:53,849 --> 00:30:02,308
example is mvlr proteins that we know

656
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:04,710
they're transcripts can produce phase

657
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:06,990
small interfering RNAs and actually this

658
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,370
is why I was mentioning before that

659
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:13,190
they're known as massive regulators of

660
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:18,298
land defense now going back to our

661
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:21,450
diagram so we have the consensus locus

662
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:23,129
we map the small rnas and now we need to

663
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,860
find the triggers and just a quick

664
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,360
reminder about what a trigger is a

665
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:29,639
trigger will represent the smaller RNA

666
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,408
that stars this process of

667
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,038
double-stranded RNA production in

668
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:36,510
subsequent cleavage now in this diagram

669
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:40,200
I must say this is not entirely accurate

670
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:42,569
and very quickly I will show you a few

671
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,000
interesting features about small RNA or

672
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:47,519
fatty RNA biogenesis that are usually

673
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,240
not accounted for so going back to my

674
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,308
mere 173 example we know it targets the

675
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,190
task 1 transcript leads to the

676
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:58,918
production of small rnas and this would

677
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:01,559
be the expected result the micro RNA

678
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:07,320
sets the register for the cleavage

679
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:11,099
ribbit now this most models are based on

680
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:13,559
21 nucleotide long face is more

681
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:15,389
interfering RNAs I don't have time to

682
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:17,700
show you the evidence but we know there

683
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,040
are actually also 22 nucleotides long

684
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,690
and small RNAs and if you think about it

685
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:23,970
this is relevant because if you change

686
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:27,990
the size for one of these molecules then

687
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:30,390
everything has shifted over and another

688
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:33,870
important feature is that per transcript

689
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:36,630
there can be multiple triggers as I'm

690
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:39,059
showing here and those triggers can

691
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:42,330
actually set up different registers from

692
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:44,759
which new small RNAs can arise and this

693
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:47,369
small RNAs can have possible new targets

694
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,079
and therefore new activities and it

695
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:52,879
overall represents an unexplored

696
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:58,649
standard regulatory capacity for this

697
00:31:52,880 --> 00:32:03,120
for each of these locusts so then going

698
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:04,710
back to my process I'm trying to find

699
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,479
the triggers that set up the production

700
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:10,529
of phases small interfering RNAs and

701
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,829
this is a summary for 74% of all my

702
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:16,019
transcripts I was able to find a trigger

703
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:18,539
there's 36% for which I couldn't

704
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:20,339
identify any and you can see here in

705
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:23,670
some cases I was able to find out down

706
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:27,089
to three triggers per transcript now

707
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:28,560
having this trigger information and just

708
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:29,730
remind you the relevance of the triggers

709
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,059
is that they can set up different

710
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:35,160
registers from which new RNAs can arise

711
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:37,440
we can now collect all the small RNAs

712
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,509
that derive from the different register

713
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,059
and different sizes that I mentioned who

714
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:44,990
make a big pool including micro RNAs and

715
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:48,359
use our daggers on data to confirm them

716
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:51,750
so here I'm showing a brief summary of

717
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:57,500
the decade on data in red this is what

718
00:32:51,750 --> 00:33:00,660
was what exists in the NCBI data

719
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,640
database in black I'm showing our

720
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:05,730
contributions so we made 16 extra

721
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:09,270
libraries which can be summarized here

722
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:10,980
where for this analysis we 89% of all

723
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:14,589
the information or all the decadent data

724
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,960
use corresponds to our libraries

725
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:18,548
and if you remember this is what we use

726
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,880
to validate the interactions between

727
00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:24,519
smaller nascent transcripts so when we

728
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,429
do that for our big pool of small rnas

729
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:31,028
we get this results we know we have two

730
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:34,298
classes of small rnas microRNAs which

731
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:36,009
I'm using unknown set this was

732
00:33:34,298 --> 00:33:39,668
describing the latest annotation of

733
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:41,919
Arabidopsis we know there's 427 micro

734
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:44,620
RNAs reported I was able to find

735
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,009
activity or confirm activity for 223

736
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:50,500
which corresponds to the most

737
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:52,778
comprehensive analysis of small RNA or

738
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:57,089
micro RNA activity in avid ops excuse

739
00:33:52,778 --> 00:33:59,169
integral Dom data now this is where the

740
00:33:57,089 --> 00:34:01,509
my main contribution of the main

741
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:05,110
contribution of my tool is in finding

742
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:06,970
all these fancy RNAs and in particularly

743
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:09,460
the ones that are active which I'm

744
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:11,800
showing here in red now I'm going to

745
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:15,190
focus on this active set of fatty RNAs

746
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,859
and break them down into four groups the

747
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:21,820
first group corresponds to 21 phase

748
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:24,309
small RNAs which kind of correspond to

749
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,179
this blue set here and this corresponds

750
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:33,039
to the small RNAs that most available

751
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:36,220
tools would find which are about 350 but

752
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,679
then there's about 250 of these active

753
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:41,368
small RNAs there are in a different

754
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:44,470
register than my tool is able to pick up

755
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:47,440
additionally there's also about 150

756
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:50,739
which are 22 nucleotides long that on

757
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,320
this most tools will not pick up unless

758
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:56,529
we do a combined search and there's a

759
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,660
subset where they're both 22 and in a

760
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:01,269
different register now again to

761
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:03,848
summarize this what I'm saying is that

762
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:05,980
using this approach we were able to

763
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:09,099
double the number of small RNAs of known

764
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:13,960
activity therefore we expanded on the

765
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:16,720
regulatory capacity we can recover now

766
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,639
we've gone through pretty much all the

767
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:21,039
motions all we have to do now is remove

768
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,750
all known active small rnas and attach

769
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:26,079
it all together to produce a model

770
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:28,389
network and four year later this is my

771
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,719
small RNA regulatory network it

772
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:36,009
this is what I was being working for now

773
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:38,409
a quick reminder I am using decagon data

774
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:40,539
for this I know I keep saying it but so

775
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:43,778
the interactions all the edges have

776
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:45,489
experimental support but even so I think

777
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:46,838
whenever at least whenever I'm

778
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:50,650
confronted to something like this

779
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:52,028
a few questions arise it's it real right

780
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,278
hopefully I convince you that it is

781
00:35:52,028 --> 00:35:56,400
because I'm using experimental or each

782
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:59,170
interaction is experimental validated

783
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,858
does it reflect biology I'll try to

784
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,880
evaluate that and most importantly as

785
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:05,528
you may have noticed I don't have

786
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,599
sufficient jokes for the length of this

787
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:09,940
seminar so if you have any suggestion

788
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,410
and you're heading forward by now I

789
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:16,829
really would need I don't know any

790
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:20,078
network jokes but no no stay there we

791
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:23,470
think about it so far but I mean showing

792
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,480
it's all the steps to lead to the

793
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:28,568
production of the networks so we're just

794
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,548
building to this moment now I get it's

795
00:36:28,568 --> 00:36:33,159
the fun part and in this I only have a

796
00:36:30,548 --> 00:36:34,989
few more things to say now just a quick

797
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:38,018
reminder the objectives were to describe

798
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:40,119
and identify and describe biologically

799
00:36:38,018 --> 00:36:44,348
relevant small RNA mediating networks

800
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:47,470
now to show that they actually valid I'm

801
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:50,048
gonna sort of go into that Network to

802
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:52,929
our old friend mu 173 which I've said

803
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:54,579
before we know a lot about it and if my

804
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:57,699
network instruction is correct I should

805
00:36:54,579 --> 00:37:00,609
be able to reconstruct what we know

806
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:02,858
about Mir 173 so I'm going to use this

807
00:37:00,608 --> 00:37:04,748
cascade for evaluation quick reminder

808
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:07,509
I'm also using this because the tricky

809
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:12,159
one there's a lot of nuances we know it

810
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:13,778
targets the test transcripts for this

811
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,058
transcript in specific there's three

812
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:18,210
triggers we know this phase changes so

813
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:20,339
there's a lot of things going on and

814
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:23,858
this would be the most challenging

815
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:26,949
example and just to guide you we have a

816
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:29,078
micro RNA we have for fuzzy low side in

817
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:31,268
the middle of these clusters the balls

818
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:33,730
around corresponds to sets of small rnas

819
00:37:31,268 --> 00:37:36,219
at the right from it we know it will

820
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,900
target their predicted to target PPR

821
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:40,289
proteins which are proteins involved in

822
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,750
defense and

823
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:44,190
is also a function for this which is

824
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:47,429
been shown to be involved in metabolic

825
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:50,250
stress so I'll try to recreate that so I

826
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:52,739
go to my network I tried to get the mere

827
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:55,739
173 sub Network represented here or

828
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:58,469
highlight in red and I'll change the

829
00:37:55,739 --> 00:38:01,199
view to something more simple so just a

830
00:37:58,469 --> 00:38:03,449
reconstructed we have one mic Rene you

831
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,189
have four transcripts and a set of low

832
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:09,000
sign so so far so good

833
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:10,769
now I'm going to show oh so here they

834
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,460
did my informatics predictions of

835
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:15,869
targets right I've been saying how I do

836
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,070
experimental validation of targets so

837
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:18,809
now I'm going to change the view and

838
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:22,080
show you the results for this with my

839
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:24,690
tool and there's a couple of things to

840
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,000
mention here the change of colors the

841
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,829
blue ones the new ones are all these

842
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,130
small RNAs there are different sizes are

843
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:33,799
in a different register so they're here

844
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,970
to illustrate the contribution of

845
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,730
including all these different nuances

846
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:41,669
into an analysis tool and on the bottom

847
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:44,369
I'm showing all the RNA transcript

848
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:46,800
targets and here hopefully you can see

849
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:49,650
it I'm showing the PPR proteins are they

850
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,890
predicted and validated to be targets so

851
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:55,769
we can reconstruct the network with the

852
00:38:52,889 --> 00:38:57,719
right topology we have the right

853
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:59,699
molecules now they have a function they

854
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:01,949
know it is involved in metabolic stress

855
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:04,649
so I took all the genes that are

856
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:07,169
targeted by this cascade and did a

857
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:09,599
functional enrichment analysis using

858
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:11,760
gold terms so I'm gonna use several this

859
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,159
plot so let me walk you through it in

860
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,330
this case the size of the circle

861
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:17,940
corresponds to the breast of the

862
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:19,829
category so for example biological

863
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,039
process is a much bigger category than

864
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:24,960
transport then white means non

865
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,809
significant enrichment everything in

866
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,449
color refers to significantly enriched

867
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:34,079
categories and the darker the more

868
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:35,579
significant the results now before you

869
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,940
go through it I'm just gonna direct you

870
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:40,500
to this side over here which corresponds

871
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,720
to categories involved in defense

872
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,000
response more importantly to abiotic

873
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:49,339
stress stimulus so what I'm showing here

874
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,710
is that using my approach and go region

875
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:55,289
functional enrichment we could

876
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:58,099
make functionally valid inferences from

877
00:39:55,289 --> 00:40:01,349
our network I was able to reconstruct or

878
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:02,670
validate my network because we have to

879
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:04,470
write the polity we have to write

880
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:07,159
molecules and we can even predict the

881
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:10,379
right functions using this approach

882
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:11,579
summarized here so again we have

883
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,349
accurate identification of the

884
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,119
components we have accurate

885
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:17,099
reconstruction of the network topology

886
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,050
you can make functional inferences that

887
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:21,720
are consistent with experimental results

888
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:24,300
I've shown how we can expand on the

889
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:26,129
regulatory capacity and just to remind

890
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,900
you we use an unbiased genome-wide

891
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,700
approach right we're not focusing on our

892
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:33,660
particular sets so we can do that type

893
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:34,980
of analysis across the genome now I'm

894
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:39,719
going to move very quickly to a

895
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:41,099
description of the network and I'm going

896
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:42,899
to change the view we know it has this

897
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:44,309
type of structure but I think it's

898
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,800
easier to read so I'm going to change

899
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:48,659
the view to this and let me walk you

900
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,789
through this rearrangement of the

901
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:53,159
network we can start here these are the

902
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:55,889
pre micro rna's these are transcripts

903
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:59,190
but get process to produce micro rna's

904
00:40:55,889 --> 00:41:02,719
so here I'm showing a set of micro rna's

905
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:05,579
that do not induce fuzzy RNA production

906
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:09,419
to the right I'm showing the micro RNAs

907
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:13,369
that do trigger fuzzy RNA production

908
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:17,690
from this pasillo site I said that the

909
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:20,010
Perdue produced Vasilisa can in turn

910
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:23,220
trigger secondary production of small

911
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:26,670
RNAs from ordered transcripts shown here

912
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:29,069
and the resulting fuzzy RNAs and also if

913
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:31,200
you remember I said I had a set for

914
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,720
which I have no time no trigger so this

915
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,299
corresponds to all the fussy producing

916
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:39,088
regions that do not for which I have no

917
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:43,440
target and at the bottom are all the

918
00:41:39,088 --> 00:41:44,849
target transcripts for each set now if

919
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,950
you were wondering what kind of genes

920
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:49,280
are involved in this network again I did

921
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:51,659
a functional enrichment analysis and

922
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,849
also before we go through all the

923
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:55,769
categories I can summarize this in a

924
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:59,309
simple statement most categories are

925
00:41:55,769 --> 00:42:02,940
represented in this network and actually

926
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:04,409
this result triggered another question

927
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,030
that I thought it was I think it's

928
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:07,589
pretty interesting we

929
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:10,230
instead of looking for categories that

930
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:13,260
are enriched because everything is there

931
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:14,880
one can think of what is not there so

932
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:17,190
with lead we did an analysis for

933
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,079
functional under-representation and

934
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,820
there's only one category that is

935
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:22,590
underrepresented my network that

936
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:26,100
corresponds to genes involved in

937
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:28,829
translational regulation and actually I

938
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:30,119
don't have a hypothesis for this I think

939
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:31,920
it's very interesting but I don't know I

940
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:35,190
have no way to explain it at the moment

941
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:41,070
anyone has any idea I'll be happy to

942
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:44,099
hear your thoughts so we have perform

943
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:45,960
other structural analysis on the

944
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:48,179
networks that I don't have the time to

945
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,429
discuss today but if you're interested

946
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:52,889
and happy to tell you about it now we're

947
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:54,929
just going to move on to the second

948
00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:56,929
objective which involves determining the

949
00:42:54,929 --> 00:43:00,089
regulatory contribution of the network

950
00:42:56,929 --> 00:43:02,099
so this is a summary of the network

951
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:04,920
components I've gone through most of

952
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:07,920
them before I just want to stress the

953
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:12,059
fact that my network includes about 20%

954
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,970
of all known auravie Dobbs's genes which

955
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:16,949
should be indicative of the overall

956
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:19,980
potential but when you think about it

957
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:22,259
it's not only the regulatory potential

958
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,360
of this network it's not only not only

959
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,030
involve the genes that are there but

960
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:30,599
also their activities an example would

961
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:32,940
be if my networks involve regulation of

962
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:37,230
a transcription factor the transcription

963
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:39,090
factor activity would play into this so

964
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,769
that's the first thing we did we started

965
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,380
asking what kind of genes are here and

966
00:43:40,769 --> 00:43:47,550
we first look for transcription factors

967
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:49,289
and here I'm highlighting in red all the

968
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:52,500
transcription factors found in our

969
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:54,989
networks the summary is that there's 25

970
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,579
26 percent of all transcription factors

971
00:43:54,989 --> 00:43:59,579
are on there small RNA regulation

972
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:03,809
according to our model we can broaden

973
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:07,319
this search by just trying to search all

974
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:10,079
genes involved in regulation and this is

975
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:15,750
a result about 30% of all genes that

976
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:17,699
have been involved or I've been shown to

977
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,840
be involved in transcription regulation

978
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:24,069
are on the small RNA control

979
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:26,370
so in summary when it comes to the

980
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:29,260
contribution or the regulatory

981
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:30,880
Constabulary 5% of all describe jeans

982
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:35,020
most function with categories are

983
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:37,390
represented and about 39 about 30% of

984
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:39,070
all genes involved in transcriptional

985
00:44:37,389 --> 00:44:43,000
regulation appeared to be under the

986
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:45,070
smaller name control now you might be

987
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,139
wondering how can we use this met

988
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:49,690
regulatory meta Network remember I use

989
00:44:47,139 --> 00:44:52,210
this I use a composite data set to

990
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:54,849
produce this and one example that may

991
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:56,650
refer to plant pathology is you can ask

992
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:59,920
the same question I was doing before but

993
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:02,519
for defense response genes so again if

994
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,280
we look for all the genes that have

995
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:10,019
function related to defense 30 percent

996
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:14,080
are under small RNA regulation so an

997
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:17,349
example here could be if you have your

998
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:21,309
system where your pathogen is disrupting

999
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:23,409
the regulation or the regulation of your

1000
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:24,880
favorite host gene either up regulated

1001
00:45:23,409 --> 00:45:26,649
it down regulated and you want to

1002
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,860
understand the mechanism at which this

1003
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:32,769
is happening you can use this model to

1004
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:35,470
ask first it's Eugene on the small RNA

1005
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:38,349
regulation and if it is where in the

1006
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:40,449
network is it how many small RNAs are

1007
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:43,210
targeting it so there's some useful

1008
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:45,069
information you can get from it but

1009
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:47,230
there's also I want to show very quickly

1010
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:50,740
and this is the last part of my talk I

1011
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:52,960
want to show how I want to do it so back

1012
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:56,319
to my plan first was to produce a model

1013
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,880
network which I've done then step two

1014
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,670
involves having

1015
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:03,640
expression data to produce now simple

1016
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:05,260
specific networks so moving from a meta

1017
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:08,769
network to something that corresponds to

1018
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:10,870
a plant or a symbol or a treatment so

1019
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:13,659
I'm going to show this is based on

1020
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:16,449
preliminary data and I'm going to use an

1021
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:19,210
example using an uninfected plant so if

1022
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:23,199
you remember I have RNAs and a small RNA

1023
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:26,230
data set from all my samples here is a

1024
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:29,049
summary of an rna-seq experiment where

1025
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:31,929
on the x-axis I thought all the Express

1026
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:33,220
genes there are about 17,000 my

1027
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:35,079
libraries

1028
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:37,929
and on the y-axis I'm showing the

1029
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:40,358
expressions the expression level as the

1030
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:41,829
log of the normalized count so there's

1031
00:46:40,358 --> 00:46:43,449
just a lot of libraries but each one of

1032
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:46,329
these corresponds to a specific gene

1033
00:46:43,449 --> 00:46:48,279
this would be the section of low

1034
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:51,400
expression genes this will corresponds

1035
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:53,109
to high express genes now from a network

1036
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,358
we know which ones are on there smaller

1037
00:46:53,108 --> 00:46:58,150
and a control which I'm going to

1038
00:46:55,358 --> 00:47:00,759
highlight here in red so about 35% of

1039
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:03,639
all the genes have the potential to be

1040
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,560
regulated by small RNAs now if you

1041
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:07,598
remember these interactions makes sense

1042
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:09,608
if both molecules are expressed you need

1043
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:12,340
the small RNA and the transcript for

1044
00:47:09,608 --> 00:47:14,019
regulation to occur so I'm not going to

1045
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:17,019
show it but I did the same analysis for

1046
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:19,710
small RNAs and then I can take all the

1047
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:22,960
data and input it into my model Network

1048
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:25,420
so here I'm highlighting in red all the

1049
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,000
nodes that show expression in an

1050
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,829
uninfected sample you can't really see

1051
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,630
the black dots because the network is so

1052
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:34,719
dense but those will corresponds to the

1053
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:36,519
non Express genes and now I'm gonna take

1054
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:40,480
away everything that is not expressed in

1055
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:42,219
this particular sample and this is what

1056
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,980
you're left with so you're gonna notice

1057
00:47:42,219 --> 00:47:47,230
here there's a bunch of free nodes this

1058
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,570
corresponds to transcripts for which the

1059
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:52,389
small RNA is not present or vice versa

1060
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:55,240
so there will be no regulatory

1061
00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:57,909
contribution here but if you look

1062
00:47:55,239 --> 00:48:00,209
there's still some edges so all the

1063
00:47:57,909 --> 00:48:02,649
edges are still exist in this network

1064
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,599
corresponds to instances in which the

1065
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:07,119
small RNA and the transcripts are

1066
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:10,720
detected as expressed in my in an

1067
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:12,460
uninfected sample so again I'm gonna

1068
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:16,239
change the view so something more

1069
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:18,280
friendly here is a method network here

1070
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:21,039
it's the network corresponding to my

1071
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,619
uninfected sample so I suspect that it

1072
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:26,108
corresponds to us much smaller subset of

1073
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:27,309
all the nodes and interactions but this

1074
00:48:26,108 --> 00:48:31,838
ones would be the ones that are relevant

1075
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:33,639
so with this example I hope that you can

1076
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:36,279
imagine how we can use this to evaluate

1077
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:39,129
virus infection virus effect on

1078
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:41,349
regulation so our plan is to produce

1079
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:43,930
this type of sample specific networks

1080
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:46,510
and then start asking what are the

1081
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:49,750
changes are the structural changes

1082
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:51,010
and also I'm showing this as an on and

1083
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:53,079
off state but they're also there's a

1084
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:55,839
quantitative side to this so you can

1085
00:48:53,079 --> 00:49:01,210
also query or ask what kind of genes are

1086
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:02,980
undergoing expression differences or

1087
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:04,599
differential gene expression and where

1088
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:09,068
do they fit in this networks and how

1089
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:13,000
viruses can affect this smaller innate

1090
00:49:09,068 --> 00:49:15,190
revelatory contribution so my

1091
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
conclusions so you can take a breath in

1092
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:20,679
that I think I'll finish with this I

1093
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,659
just want to say that for my thesis

1094
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:24,219
project and this process this project

1095
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:26,818
what I did was to construct the model

1096
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:31,209
network of a smaller in a regulatory

1097
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:33,068
global regulation I confirmed the

1098
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:35,710
accuracy of my approach and illustrated

1099
00:49:33,068 --> 00:49:37,779
how it expands in previous reports I've

1100
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:39,699
validated the regulatory potential

1101
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,740
smaller in a mediated networks this is

1102
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:44,139
basically going back to those big claims

1103
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:46,358
about smaller and a being massive

1104
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:48,279
regulators of gene expression now we

1105
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:51,608
have data to support that claim and I

1106
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,980
think it's true I develop a ban from

1107
00:49:51,608 --> 00:49:56,039
Mike's tool that it can be used for

1108
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,809
other species giving some requirements

1109
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:01,568
the tool can be thought of as a Hungry

1110
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:03,490
tool this means that the more data

1111
00:50:01,568 --> 00:50:05,108
becomes available we can add that data

1112
00:50:03,489 --> 00:50:08,618
and update our model to get better

1113
00:50:05,108 --> 00:50:11,048
resolution the tool is not publicly

1114
00:50:08,619 --> 00:50:13,358
available yet and we're not sure whether

1115
00:50:11,048 --> 00:50:15,699
we're going to pursue a publication for

1116
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:19,358
it but if you're interested we can apply

1117
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:22,118
it to other systems and most importantly

1118
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:24,159
we finally develop a model system that

1119
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:27,579
can be used to study the role of small

1120
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:30,879
RNAs in viral pathogenesis or your

1121
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:33,789
favorite topic actually so for future

1122
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,910
directions I think it should be clear

1123
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:38,409
that what we want to do is use this

1124
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:40,960
resulting model to determine the role of

1125
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:46,389
small RNA mediated networks in viral

1126
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:47,650
photo Genesis basically and also what is

1127
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:49,480
the effect of viral silencing

1128
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:51,730
suppressors and holes smaller in a

1129
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,579
mediated networks which will be involved

1130
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:58,719
asking what is the role of small RNAs in

1131
00:50:54,579 --> 00:50:59,340
this phenotype development and I would

1132
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:01,259
just

1133
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:04,130
to finish with acknowledgments I

1134
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:07,260
especially want to thank Keith for

1135
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,730
sticking up with me for five years it's

1136
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,860
been a great time I really enjoy the lab

1137
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:15,179
I particularly enjoyed the opportunity

1138
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:18,210
of pursuing a project of my design and

1139
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:19,769
interest just just seemed far-fetched at

1140
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,079
the beginning but it was a great

1141
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:24,590
experience I'd also like to thank all

1142
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:29,039
the my committee members for their

1143
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:31,320
advice and support mark Fuchs dr. Faye

1144
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,940
and Chris Myers I especially want to

1145
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,400
thank my lab members so Jeremy is not

1146
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:37,470
here today but he's been a great person

1147
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,769
to have in the lab he knows a lot of it

1148
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:42,869
he knows a lot and he's very useful

1149
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:44,759
hitter a lab technician also thank you

1150
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:47,549
for the support and for keeping us

1151
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,220
honest in the lab there's been a set of

1152
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:52,530
series of undergrads that have helped in

1153
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:55,739
different projects are also like to

1154
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:58,860
thank Andrew Grimson and Stefanie Watson

1155
00:51:55,739 --> 00:52:02,519
which is undergoing a grad student in a

1156
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:03,960
new green stone slab that helped us

1157
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:06,690
during the development of small RNA

1158
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,280
libraries and also Julia Brevard

1159
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:10,889
self-injure ruined gene giovannini slab

1160
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,040
that assisted us in developing or

1161
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:17,029
establishing the library making

1162
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:20,880
technologies and finally there's also

1163
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:24,420
funny sources for this work most of

1164
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,980
these were involved in the set of virus

1165
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,349
related projects that I described at the

1166
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,860
beginning and my network's project was

1167
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:35,069
been partly funded by cats

1168
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:38,750
so with that like to thank you for your

1169
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:38,750
attention and take your questions

1170
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:45,328
[Applause]

1171
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:55,780
questions I'm wondering how you take all

1172
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:59,739
of these different data sets all

1173
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:03,400
together at work in a way that you would

1174
00:52:59,739 --> 00:53:06,159
seem like to be completely sure that you

1175
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,539
have the pathway correct I think when

1176
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:10,359
you put it in your network you have to

1177
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:14,759
see of all of those parts in the same

1178
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:17,710
sample so like for one sample for what

1179
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:20,560
tissue sample you would have an S RNA

1180
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:23,260
library and RNA stick library megiddo

1181
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:25,630
library and make sure that you see all

1182
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:31,000
of the parts that you need to see when

1183
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:32,800
you use this larger set of libraries how

1184
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,469
does that are you taking that into

1185
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,450
account or how are you dealing with that

1186
00:53:35,469 --> 00:53:42,339
to make sure that all the parts are in

1187
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:43,960
the right place right time okay I feel

1188
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,789
let me see if I understand it's just to

1189
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,010
recapitulate the question is how do I

1190
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:49,719
know that my method network is

1191
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:53,620
representative of a network that would

1192
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:59,289
occur in a single sample thing is it if

1193
00:53:53,619 --> 00:54:02,559
you identify from gravitas as fruits and

1194
00:53:59,289 --> 00:54:07,380
you find a cleavage but you're my

1195
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:12,159
earning and then smaller days are shoots

1196
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:16,990
it's not really relevant right and so

1197
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:24,399
this would I'll go back to you this

1198
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:26,618
figure here yeah so or actually maybe

1199
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:32,150
this one here

1200
00:54:26,619 --> 00:54:33,590
if for this regulatory for the recollect

1201
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:35,480
area effect you occurred you need the

1202
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:39,500
small RNA in a transcript to be present

1203
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:41,449
at the same time and here all the free

1204
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,070
notes so this is a network for an

1205
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:45,469
uninfected sample so it represents one

1206
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:46,820
treatment and actually represents a

1207
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:50,689
tissue so we're dealing with tissue

1208
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:53,180
averages all the free nodes in this

1209
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:55,340
network corresponds to instances in

1210
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:58,460
which one of the two in the pair is not

1211
00:54:55,340 --> 00:55:00,590
present so if we don't see expression we

1212
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:09,679
don't make a connection when we evaluate

1213
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:11,720
it in a single library right now another

1214
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,129
thing you can consider is they also have

1215
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:14,659
to be pressing in the same cell or

1216
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,920
something like that but well actually

1217
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:17,779
that's not entirely true they're not

1218
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,119
cell autonomous so they can move around

1219
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:26,360
I think that using the approach of

1220
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:29,180
tissue averages is okay now even if we

1221
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:33,740
have both nodes expressing us in the

1222
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:35,389
same tissue library we don't know well

1223
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:37,699
actually I'm not trying to evaluate

1224
00:55:35,389 --> 00:55:40,039
cleavage per library I'm evaluating

1225
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:43,129
expression and the way we're going to

1226
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:45,409
use this is in a comparative form so if

1227
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:48,289
I produce this type of network in an

1228
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:52,569
uninfected an infected sample I can see

1229
00:55:48,289 --> 00:55:55,340
how the dynamics change so I can see I

1230
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:57,260
would be able to see if a micro RNA

1231
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:00,740
expression goes up and its target

1232
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:04,000
correspondingly goes down this would

1233
00:56:00,739 --> 00:56:07,729
correspond that were corresponds to

1234
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,989
meaningful interactions so I mostly most

1235
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,608
of the downstream analysis would be

1236
00:56:08,989 --> 00:56:12,919
based on that I'm looking at the

1237
00:56:10,608 --> 00:56:15,650
dynamics of each pair upon different

1238
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:21,619
treatments yeah I understand that I'm

1239
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:23,210
just about alright so the reference

1240
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:28,490
network is just a map of interactions

1241
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:30,559
and they don't necessarily exist in any

1242
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:34,608
given plant and sometimes they may never

1243
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:37,309
be present so one could think that some

1244
00:56:34,608 --> 00:56:38,389
of these nodes never occurred but this

1245
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:40,019
is showing the overall regulatory

1246
00:56:38,389 --> 00:56:43,170
potential when

1247
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:44,659
we look at expression then we see which

1248
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:49,980
ones are active and which ones are not

1249
00:56:44,659 --> 00:56:52,769
the issue is that we when we started we

1250
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:54,960
were planning to do and network /

1251
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:56,429
treatment and we realized that the

1252
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,639
results are not comparable we need a

1253
00:56:56,429 --> 00:57:02,789
model network because if you have a

1254
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:04,859
fancy law so there is on it has very

1255
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:05,519
very low expression you may not detect

1256
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:08,910
it at all

1257
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:10,559
so our aim was to get all the map all

1258
00:57:08,909 --> 00:57:20,579
the interactions map and then input

1259
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:23,630
expression data to do it whether whether

1260
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:26,460
they any different those that this

1261
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:29,369
protected my production or the curve

1262
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:34,500
shirt between the wear words in fact in

1263
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:38,759
fact see that where the drivers family

1264
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:41,929
interactions are called the big

1265
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:47,100
syntactic my adoption order or the

1266
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:48,659
tradition will show the loose I'll yeah

1267
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:51,210
so this is a good question and this is

1268
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:55,440
actually what we plan to do now because

1269
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:57,179
if you think about a virus acting so I

1270
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,340
mentioned that viruses in code silencing

1271
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:01,889
suppressors and sinuses suppressors will

1272
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:05,070
affect the production of small RNAs so

1273
00:58:01,889 --> 00:58:06,960
in a virus setting you may be preventing

1274
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:08,910
the production of these micro RNAs over

1275
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,309
here if you block the production of

1276
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:13,889
micronus over here you may lose all the

1277
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:16,889
downstream regulation and that would be

1278
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:20,309
I mean this a lot of potential genes

1279
00:58:16,889 --> 00:58:21,989
involved in this so that's what we're

1280
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:24,840
heading we don't have the data yet we're

1281
00:58:21,989 --> 00:58:26,669
working on that but yeah we won't really

1282
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:29,280
want to know how viruses will change the

1283
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:33,690
structure and we know they can target

1284
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:36,240
each step interest of time I think I

1285
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:38,950
will ask you to thank Jose and anyone

1286
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:42,079
who's interested in discussing it

1287
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:42,079
