1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:16,250
so I'm going to be presenting today

4
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:18,198
trying to understand the co inheritance

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,350
of two traits that are very important

6
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,410
for a building program we're using a

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:30,618
method called regional corporate ability

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:34,189
mapping now I'll go into that so I have

9
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:37,880
a picture about what conventional

10
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:41,390
cassava looks like smelly white to cream

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:45,530
and then this is what we call the yellow

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:49,340
cassava which is an effort by harvest

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:57,980
plus two for bio fortified cassava with

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:01:01,220
protocol in a and so harvest clause it's

15
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:04,338
a program with the CG systems and and

16
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:08,929
with cassava the main target is

17
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:11,629
programming a and in fact beta-carotene

18
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:16,250
is the programming a that is targeted

19
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:19,339
but total carotenoids which shows itself

20
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,799
a silly look coloration of the flesh

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,020
it's a good proxy for measuring

22
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,810
beta-carotene because the process of

23
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:31,219
measuring data correction is HPLC M is

24
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:34,549
kind of tedious so we have a prevalent

25
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:36,228
problem right now with the yellow

26
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:39,340
cassava the yellow cassava has

27
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:43,010
drastically low dramatic content and

28
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,780
this is a problem because in fact the

29
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:49,700
value of cassava is to drive matter

30
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:54,019
content and the yield that it that it

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:57,590
gets we get per hectare so there has

32
00:01:54,019 --> 00:02:00,439
been reports mainly most African

33
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,380
building programs of a negative

34
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:07,310
correlation between this dry matter and

35
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:10,609
this yellow coloration of tubers and the

36
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:13,789
Hardin County reports in South America I

37
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:17,450
can see at Columbia they don't see this

38
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:19,009
negative correlation so we think is

39
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:21,469
majorly in the African

40
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:24,519
I'm plasm so the motivation is to

41
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:28,789
understand the genetic business of this

42
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:31,549
negative correlation and to do this we

43
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:33,798
employ a method we turn the regional

44
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:37,579
co-head ability mapping and now walk

45
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:40,219
through the procedure so the procedure

46
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:46,010
starts by fitting a bivariate G block

47
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:52,729
model and the traits our diameter and D

48
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:55,158
be a value from a kilometer I think it's

49
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:59,119
what is called and it just measures the

50
00:02:55,158 --> 00:03:03,348
color so we take the be the dry matter

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:07,969
trade we fitted by very G blob using

52
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:11,719
this model and in fact the way the model

53
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:17,509
is fitted is that we have a stack of the

54
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:20,719
two traits and we see the X matrix is

55
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:23,810
the in our model he's just for the

56
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,609
location effects because the data was

57
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:31,759
collected from multiple locations and

58
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:35,419
then we show the genomic effect in U and

59
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:39,128
here we show that these effects have has

60
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:42,169
covariance from two covariances one from

61
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:44,598
DK which is a decomposition of the

62
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:49,609
genomic leadership matrix that comes

63
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:51,738
from markers and VG which is the trait

64
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:55,329
bitrate covariance matrix that we are

65
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:58,009
estimating the same goes for arrow and

66
00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:00,430
for Harrow is simplified because we have

67
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:03,638
an identity matrix showing no

68
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:07,250
correlation between data points and we

69
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:10,430
fit this model and then the next thing

70
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,919
back solve to best knit effects from

71
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,250
from from these values from the genomic

72
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:19,609
values and Smith effects are estimated

73
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,720
by multiplying the transpose of the maca

74
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:25,549
matriz this maka matrix is centered

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:30,039
multiplied by the inverse of the genomic

76
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:32,329
relationship matrix and the estimated

77
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:37,009
genomic effect from

78
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:41,689
each trade so after you back souls we

79
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:45,699
try to standardize again using just like

80
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:50,000
we make how we make a G matrix using the

81
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:54,158
denominator from Bernadin at all 2008

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,459
and then the next thing is that we being

83
00:04:54,158 --> 00:05:05,620
sneaky FEX within chromosomes into

84
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:09,288
segments and this segment are unique

85
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,750
3,000 snips and they are actually unique

86
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:15,228
there is no overlap so we divide the

87
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,930
chromosome into different segments we

88
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:20,389
tend this genomic segments and when we

89
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,550
have been them of course there are a

90
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:26,780
detail end of the chromosome some of

91
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:29,300
them are less than 3000 so after being

92
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:32,929
them we solve for clonal genomics

93
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:38,810
segment values and which commit for this

94
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:41,449
by multiplying the maca matrix again we

95
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:48,050
do Smitty FET that was calculated prior

96
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:52,218
and and then we correlate this clonal

97
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:54,770
genomic segment values with cloner for

98
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:57,620
dry matter and cloner genomic segment

99
00:05:54,769 --> 00:06:00,008
values for the bit rate and this is how

100
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,319
we get the correlation for each segment

101
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:05,718
so these were modeled using block

102
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:10,189
personality programs and other matrix

103
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:12,769
computations were done in our so the

104
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:15,620
data for the analysis was majorly

105
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:17,930
genetic gain population the entik gain

106
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,629
is a breeding population from the ITA

107
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:25,158
and then we had been merged since the

108
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:27,189
70s so we use only data collected in two

109
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:30,408
years

110
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:32,839
so we use the dry matter and the D trait

111
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:36,259
as I said previously but we have a

112
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:39,439
second trait we call a sorry third trait

113
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:42,930
we call pop color and this is a binary

114
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:45,899
trait that actually measures

115
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:50,610
the color of the the root which is one

116
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:55,829
for white and then two for did cream to

117
00:06:50,610 --> 00:07:01,590
yellow we use about this number of GBS

118
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:04,379
nips 451 clones for white 262 clones for

119
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:08,788
yellow that I was from three locations

120
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:11,728
and we we do this analysis in the older

121
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:15,839
populations white yellow and white plus

122
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:22,038
yellow scuse me so this is the result

123
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:27,478
from white plus yellow so each bar is

124
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:30,509
3,000 snip segment each color so as you

125
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:33,060
go from black to red to black to red so

126
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:36,449
each color difference is a new

127
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,478
chromosome and what we see from this

128
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:42,689
analysis is if you look at the skills

129
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:45,930
this here in Y the estimated genetic

130
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:46,620
correlation and in X of course the

131
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,050
chromosomes

132
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:53,149
you see we see an overwhelmingly

133
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:56,728
negative correlation at chromosome 1 and

134
00:07:53,149 --> 00:08:00,959
then it seems that other chromosomes are

135
00:07:56,728 --> 00:08:03,569
a bit slight or neutral this is for both

136
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,299
white and yellow populations and we'll

137
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:09,408
move to the white we see a different

138
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,680
result if you look at the scales of the

139
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:21,719
genetic correlation and white we observe

140
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:24,090
like a strong strong correlation here

141
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,650
not strong in terms of the value but

142
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:30,810
this segment shows very strong

143
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:34,199
correlation and then we also see

144
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:37,229
something here that most of the of the

145
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,690
segments in white are positive for the

146
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:44,759
TV but we have observed positive

147
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:49,290
correlations so to move to yellow we see

148
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:52,200
something that we sorry we see something

149
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:55,919
we saw in the previous one with white

150
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,310
and yellow but different in our cause is

151
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,878
that

152
00:08:56,309 --> 00:09:02,458
we see that almost if at all apart from

153
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:06,259
the neutral ones overwhelmingly

154
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:11,399
negatively correlated for the yellow so

155
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:14,999
what does this show before we we go to

156
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,999
discussion I want to show this genetic

157
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:20,999
correlation from the bivariate model

158
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:22,409
itself not not the mapping and in white

159
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:25,409
we have we observe a positive

160
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:28,078
correlation and yellow observe a strong

161
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:32,039
negative correlation and when you have

162
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:35,998
both we have a weak negative correlation

163
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:39,328
so the correlation stems to they tend to

164
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:42,959
be consistent between these and the maps

165
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:48,120
and we observe is very strong negative

166
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:51,649
correlation for the yellow so what does

167
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:55,889
this mean for the program it means that

168
00:09:51,649 --> 00:10:00,058
this several development of high dry

169
00:09:55,889 --> 00:10:02,278
matter white varieties and in fact this

170
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:04,620
product is already in high demand in

171
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:08,250
Africa but for the food and stretch

172
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:11,250
industries and we will recommend a

173
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:15,688
separate beta program for this and then

174
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:20,600
if you move to yellow we observe

175
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:24,328
overwhelming that it does sever yellow

176
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,519
variety development and this is indeed

177
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:32,008
discouraging because of the high hopes

178
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:34,740
we have for habits plus but there has

179
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:38,009
been a lot of effort already towards

180
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:41,459
this and in fact a lot of clones are

181
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:43,889
brought in from CH and used in the

182
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:49,318
brilliant program for this and it's

183
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:53,339
ongoing now we see the result and it's

184
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:55,860
also a good target for Chris wife if if

185
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:58,920
we find what is going on completely and

186
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,889
in fact there is also chance that there

187
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:07,469
can be a recombinant who knows when this

188
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:09,620
happens and in conclusion want to

189
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:13,160
highlight what is going on in chromosome

190
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,720
one chromosome one is one that we know

191
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:18,829
already that there is an integration

192
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:22,580
that happened in the thirties or after

193
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:26,210
that as well in most cultivated cassava

194
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:28,820
in Africa and chromosome one seems to be

195
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:31,278
the culprit in this case but chromosome

196
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:35,839
one is also good for dry matter so it's

197
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:38,960
a very difficult case and we actually

198
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,260
showing the methodology because it shows

199
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,629
very good way to see what is going on

200
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:47,000
between these two traits and in the end

201
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:50,919
we think that they'll give some progress

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,919
from the results thank you very much
