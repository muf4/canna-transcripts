1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,960
University uh I'm very excited to be

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:17,320
here I'm also a little uneasy because uh

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,400
as Kevin mentioned I am uh very broad uh

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,679
broadly trained macro ecologist um

6
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,118
sometimes I think I'm a conservation

7
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,800
biologist definitely not a PL scientist

8
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:30,160
so uh bear with me some uh some

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,878
information may be uh spotty in terms of

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:38,000
uh maybe what is uh the core interest uh

11
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:39,920
for you so um to put to put my uh

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,679
presentation in perspective it's all

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,079
about new ways um to study or

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,558
investigate an old questions an old

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,600
question where uh why are species

16
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:54,679
distributed or found where they are and

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,800
I'd like to start with with uh an

18
00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:01,920
inspiring uh quote uh that uh pushes

19
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,558
biologists or at least in 1985 IO Wilson

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,280
was pushing biologists to to take on

21
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:10,239
this Grand Challenge of trying to

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,280
describe and trying to uh to learn more

23
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:17,039
about about diversity uh in general uh

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,879
worldwide so uh in the words of IO

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,360
Wilson um this is a mission worth uh all

26
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:27,599
our effort so that was 1985 not too long

27
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:31,280
ago uh then in 2010 another great

28
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:34,879
enologist um came back to tell us that

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,560
it is uh critical it is very important

30
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:41,719
to try to study diversity on our planet

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,600
and maybe what we need is a a grand

32
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:47,640
approach the type of approach and the

33
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:51,519
type of of um um funding and resources

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,040
that uh NASA has so uh you know some

35
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:57,759
years ago 15 years after EO wison um

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,479
called uh all scientists to study

37
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,959
diversity and focus on that uh 15 years

38
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:08,878
later uh the message was uh very similar

39
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:11,639
or even uh Stronger now um another appro

40
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,439
another message that is related to

41
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:18,598
trying to understand trying to study uh

42
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:22,000
diversity and um and uh basically

43
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:25,039
provide a justification for this effort

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,239
uh is from the uh from the world of um

45
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:31,479
ecosystem science and valuation of uh

46
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,519
ecosystem services so the idea here is

47
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:36,518
we do want to know as much as we can

48
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,239
about species and it is uh worth

49
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,840
investing our time because our

50
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,400
understanding of species distribution

51
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,920
and function and ecosystems actually in

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,439
the end uh overall affect uh human uh

53
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:53,598
life uh quality so so basically put a

54
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:56,239
spin to our type of research that that

55
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:59,679
um makes the public more interested and

56
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,680
more aware of why we study uh diversity

57
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,840
uh

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,239
patterns okay uh just to give you a very

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,560
brief um schematic view of what I do and

60
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:14,640
then uh a cloud of uh of words that are

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,519
more uh common or abundant in in uh my

62
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,279
publication so far I am as I said

63
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,039
broadly speaking interested in

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,598
interested in species distributions and

65
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,759
uh factors that affect species

66
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:29,000
distributions and I use um several ways

67
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,000
of of um addressing questions that are

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,840
related to uh species distributions and

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,479
then um the uh understanding our

70
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,640
understanding of species distributions

71
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,639
does um Branch out into many different

72
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,199
fields and I'm just naming a few here

73
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,958
conservation biology uh biogeography and

74
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:50,679
disease ecology the more uh recent

75
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,319
ones okay so what I want to do today is

76
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,079
give you an idea of the kind of work

77
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:58,798
that I do and maybe spark some interest

78
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:02,439
in uh you're using some of these methods

79
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,560
for your your own research and my plan

80
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:08,878
is to go down uh spatial scale from

81
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,598
broad scale questions to maybe Regional

82
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,679
uh all the way to fine scale you'll

83
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:16,279
notice that I have one here the last the

84
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:20,519
fin finest scale uh question in gray

85
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:23,239
area uh gray uh font and that is because

86
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,759
we are just starting to work uh more on

87
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,280
this uh at this level on this scale and

88
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,720
we have more questions and more data to

89
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:36,159
collect can analyze than actually uh

90
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,680
giving you uh uh answers okay now to uh

91
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,840
in order to uh address questions at at

92
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,478
these various scales uh questions

93
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:46,719
related to distribution and uh factors

94
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:52,000
that affect species uh distributions uh

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,919
I'm using um two main um types of uh of

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,478
uh research uh uh techniques one is

97
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:58,240
ecological niche modeling and the other

98
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,680
one is remote sensing so I'll give you

99
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,439
brief very brief overviews on the two as

100
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,360
we go down the scale uh to these uh to

101
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:09,879
to see these examples these are plant

102
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,280
examples as I said um they may not be uh

103
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,959
very uh dense and informatively

104
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,119
informative bi from a biological

105
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,000
standpoint but hopefully you can help me

106
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,519
fill in the blanks uh in those areas

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,839
okay so ecological niche Ming or enm um

108
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:30,120
is a very um active field uh of research

109
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,399
but what I wanted to do first is start

110
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,840
with uh just uh an understanding of the

111
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,599
terminology because we know that Niche

112
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:41,399
uh can mean various things to uh various

113
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,919
people so you may be aware of the uh

114
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,679
over the EC the history of ecology you

115
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:50,240
may be aware of um definitions of Niche

116
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,319
provided by grenell in the early 1900s

117
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,560
Elton in the 1930s and then Hutchinson

118
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:59,319
uh in the 1950s and uh 60s so what how

119
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,560
do we make sense of all these uh

120
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:04,600
defition definitions um well um to me it

121
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,959
makes sense and to other people it makes

122
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,319
sense to think of the uh effects that

123
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,879
organisms have on environments on the

124
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,720
environments that they occupy versus the

125
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:19,759
uh responses that organisms have to um

126
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,319
the uh environments and the the kinds of

127
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:26,080
uh uh um requirements that organisms

128
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,560
have um where how they choose

129
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,120
environments in which they uh they uh

130
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,478
live and survive okay so if we think

131
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,160
about the niche from from this effects

132
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,839
versus responses or impacts of species

133
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,919
on the environments versus requirements

134
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,478
uh environmental requirements of species

135
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,038
maybe it's a little uh uh easier to make

136
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,439
sense of these uh

137
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:51,519
definitions okay and then uh trying to

138
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:56,160
put the uh the niche Concepts on

139
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:58,359
a uh Geographic uh scale we can think of

140
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,720
um questions that are addressed at small

141
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,439
scale extents geography extents versus

142
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,840
large Geographic extents and on this

143
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,439
sliding scale uh going back to impacts

144
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,439
versus

145
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:14,319
requirements uh think about at the small

146
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,199
Geographic extent uh when we talk about

147
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,759
species impacts what we are talking

148
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,639
about is the uh functional role of

149
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:24,280
species in that in that at that uh small

150
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:27,639
scale and for these kinds of questions

151
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:31,159
we usually use um uh mechanistics

152
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:34,319
mechanistic models that try to quantify

153
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,000
the uh the dynamic relationships between

154
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,720
uh between species think think uh think

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,160
of uh consumer uh resource uh Dynamics

156
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,319
so those are very different models than

157
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,879
what uh what I uh do which is at larger

158
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,000
uh extents and ecological niche modeling

159
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,039
is um more useful at these larger

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,598
extents I should point over here uh

161
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:01,959
where um the interest is in the uh

162
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:05,839
requirements that species have in order

163
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:09,399
to survive in a certain uh region so

164
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:12,000
that uh summarizes uh the geographic

165
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:15,158
Niche or the abiotic Niche uh of a

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,720
species and to do that uh we uh use

167
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:20,199
empirical models uh and I'll show you

168
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,319
one type of models that we use in this

169
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,080
broad umbrella of ecological niche

170
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,560
modeling and the big assumption here is

171
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:30,120
that the requirements the environmental

172
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,879
requirements of the species are stronger

173
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,719
than the interactions the biotic

174
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,719
interactions so basically the abiotic

175
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,800
interactions are more important than

176
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,399
biotic interactions in shaping the

177
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,120
distribution of species at these larger

178
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,399
uh

179
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,200
scales okay so how do we go about if we

180
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,000
are into the ecological niche modeling

181
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,480
field uh how do we go about measuring

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,679
estimating quantifying this abiotic or

183
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,039
or grenan niche as it is known in the

184
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,838
literature well there are three methods

185
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,759
that I'm aware of or three uh possible

186
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,040
approach approaches one would be

187
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:09,720
physiological experiments so we go in

188
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:13,319
the lab and we test the uh limits that

189
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,278
uh a species uh has an organism has to

190
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,320
let's say varying temperature um if it's

191
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:21,679
an aquatic species wearing salinity so

192
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,800
on so forth so uh we go uh into the lab

193
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,799
and we uh find out what are the

194
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,879
physiological boundaries of the species

195
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:33,479
which can then possibly be mapped uh on

196
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:36,000
geography this is really hard work to do

197
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,839
and if we are interested in uh mapping

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,039
the biodiversity of a little study uh of

199
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,360
a a study that has not been of a country

200
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,919
that has not been studied very well uh

201
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,600
we do not have time to uh develop

202
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,759
physiological models for many different

203
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:56,560
species uh for which we don't have uh

204
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:59,759
information then a slightly um maybe uh

205
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:02,399
mad scientist scenario would be to

206
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,720
introduce species in various types of

207
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,480
environments uh and figure out which

208
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,200
kinds of environments sustain uh allow

209
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,039
that species to survive in uh uh long

210
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,519
term this is obviously impr practical a

211
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,639
large large scale probably unethical we

212
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,519
don't want to uh change ecosystems by uh

213
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,319
doing these kinds of large scale uh

214
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,360
studies intro introducing species so the

215
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,560
third method that is widely used in

216
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,278
ecological niche modeling world is has

217
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,319
to do with

218
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:35,078
uh making use of information we have

219
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,800
available about where species are and

220
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:40,078
the environmental conditions that are

221
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:43,439
present at those locations so we build

222
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:46,399
uh correlation type uh models uh simply

223
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,880
put uh that quantify that relationship

224
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,759
between where species are and what kind

225
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:54,958
of environments are uh present at those

226
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:57,679
locations and just to give you uh more

227
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,518
um visual on the the um these

228
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,599
correlation approaches uh to estimate

229
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,320
environmental requirements we start with

230
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,278
uh species records uh these could be uh

231
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:11,519
Museum specimens this could these could

232
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:14,919
be surveys um any type of um of uh

233
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:18,919
occurrence data then we uh on top of

234
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:20,519
that we use various uh digitized maps of

235
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:23,399
uh environmental conditions and I'm

236
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,799
showing you just some examples here uh

237
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,799
precipitation um annual precipitation

238
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,199
annual temperature seasonality of uh

239
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,958
precipitation and temperature uh so on

240
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,120
so forth and then these form our um

241
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:39,919
calibration data or training data which

242
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,519
we use to uh build a model estimate the

243
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:45,919
niche of that species and there is a

244
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:48,440
plethora of um algorithms and approaches

245
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,559
to making sense quantifying this

246
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,040
relationship between organism uh

247
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,319
presence and environment uh I'm naming

248
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:58,559
just a few here and I'll uh I'll briefly

249
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,200
mention uh show maxen okay oops sorry

250
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,000
jumped one so once we have that once we

251
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,399
have the model calibrated with these

252
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,559
occurrences and environmental data what

253
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:11,078
we do is uh we then project this model

254
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,359
back onto geography so we take we we

255
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:15,719
take data out of the geographic context

256
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,959
the spatial context in this

257
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,920
environmental uh context we build a

258
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,919
model we calibrate the model and then we

259
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,519
take that model back into geography we

260
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,078
project that model and I'll get back to

261
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,639
why this is important this model

262
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,759
projection but what we get is an

263
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,799
estimation

264
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:36,439
of suitability uh across the landscape

265
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,958
for that particular uh species uh of uh

266
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,279
interest and I need to move a lot far

267
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,958
faster okay so one of the widely used

268
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,919
algorithms is Max send uh this the the

269
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,879
paper that uh was that promoted the use

270
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:51,679
of Max end or described uh this

271
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:55,198
algorithm was published in 2006 it has

272
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:58,599
been cited over 3,000 times now it is a

273
00:12:55,198 --> 00:13:02,519
widely used uh methodology what we do

274
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:05,560
here is is uh basically uh contrast

275
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,000
known presences with the rest uh of the

276
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:10,159
environment so we have some occurrences

277
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,600
we have some knowledge of where species

278
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:16,559
uh is present in uh in um on a landscape

279
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,519
and we contrast the conditions at

280
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,078
presences with the conditions at uh

281
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,959
across the rest of the landscape and

282
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:28,120
that's one way of uh of quantifying uh

283
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:31,039
suitability we get a probability of

284
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,320
suitability more likely if the the

285
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,319
conditions are similar to presences and

286
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,000
less likely if the conditions are

287
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,800
similar to uh the rest of the background

288
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,039
so it's contrasting presence and the

289
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:46,519
rest of the environment okay so jumping

290
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,958
to the first uh example of uh the use of

291
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,799
n ecological niche modeling uh I put

292
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,159
this at the largest

293
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:56,278
scale but you'll see that we actually

294
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:58,078
varied the scale uh of the question uh

295
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,519
for this uh for this project and the

296
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:04,000
idea was uh can we create reliable uh

297
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,480
species richness estimates when we are

298
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,879
dealing with various uh Geographic

299
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,639
extents or the scale of of our analysis

300
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:15,600
uh

301
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:17,959
varies and this is an area of um intense

302
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,040
research because we use these uh

303
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:23,719
estimated species uh richness maps to

304
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:27,360
create for example hotpots for

305
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,920
conservation or for um future climate uh

306
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,759
effects so on so forth so knowing how

307
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,919
well we estimate species richness with

308
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:37,440
ecological niche modeling uh is of

309
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:40,759
importance uh for various uh reasons

310
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,480
okay so the question is do we um do we

311
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,959
get various estimates in terms of uh

312
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,800
quality various species Rich richness

313
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:51,599
estimates from ecological niche modeling

314
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,758
when the scale uh varies so that that

315
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,600
was the question that we tried to answer

316
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:00,959
um um AJ Harris is not a PhD candidate

317
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,680
anymore she uh she successfully defended

318
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,879
about two weeks ago so she's moving on

319
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:07,919
to a postto at the Smithsonian but she

320
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:10,679
was the main uh driver of of uh this uh

321
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,360
particular study and then her advisor uh

322
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,958
Dr Mike Palmer uh both from the uh

323
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,800
botney Department um at Oklahoma State

324
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:21,198
and we are working uh the journ the uh

325
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,120
the manuscript is in review hopefully uh

326
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:28,479
we'll have um positive criticism and

327
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:32,519
useful uh reviews back soon okay so what

328
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:36,079
was the idea here the idea was to um

329
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:38,799
compare uh correlate uh observed species

330
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:41,159
richness with estimated species richness

331
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,599
so the observed species richness these

332
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:46,838
data come from floras and the estimated

333
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,959
species richness uh um the data come

334
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,639
from uh stacked models so we build uh we

335
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:55,000
build basically um sorry I I'll talk

336
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,000
about the models later but okay so what

337
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,078
is the uh observed species richness our

338
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,839
this is what we consider the um standard

339
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:09,078
uh in the study so uh using um a large

340
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,040
amount of data from various uh floras

341
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,599
that um a lot of data came from the

342
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:18,278
floras of North America project but also

343
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:22,959
from checklists and um very small scale

344
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:28,439
uh floras across uh North America we um

345
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:32,919
well uh AJ mostly AJ amassed um a data

346
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:35,079
set of of uh caasi and pinac species in

347
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:38,000
uh North America North of Mexico so

348
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:41,198
excluding Mexico uh we didn't have uh uh

349
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,240
data in uh for for Mexico so what you

350
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,519
see are at the county level but the

351
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,639
floras had different scales but at the

352
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,078
county level you see the uh species

353
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,120
richness the number of species in uh

354
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:57,198
these two families that we decided to uh

355
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,078
compare okay and then uh based on the

356
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:03,759
the uh information that we had about the

357
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:07,318
floras uh we uh created six classes of

358
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:10,240
extends or um floras that were uh

359
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:14,318
generated at uh six different extents

360
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,959
starting from um 10 hectare uh between

361
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,599
10 hectare and 100 hectares all the way

362
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,798
to a million to 10 million hectares and

363
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:27,918
we try to have uh a very well balanced

364
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:30,440
um uh data set uh we uh split the um uh

365
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,120
the Flora information in the three uh

366
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,919
regions Arctic Atlantic and Pacific and

367
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,479
we had in each scale class we had the

368
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,919
same number of floras that we uh

369
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,960
considered for this study okay and then

370
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,038
for the estimated species richness we

371
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,360
applied ecological niche modeling

372
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:51,759
species by species we build models uh

373
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:53,399
for uh for the caas and pinac uh with

374
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,558
the same occurrence data environmental

375
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,120
data approach uh maxent ecological niche

376
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,038
modeling uh algorithm and we create

377
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,599
these predicted distributions for each

378
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:07,440
species which then we stacked for each

379
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:09,319
Flora okay so what did we get oh sorry

380
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,400
and I forgot to mention we had 24

381
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:15,519
species of caasi and 51 species of Pac

382
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,240
most of the data for the ecological

383
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,679
niche modeling Pro uh part of this

384
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,640
project came from the global

385
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:24,720
biodiversity information facility which

386
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,799
uh is a distributed uh database of uh

387
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,759
Museum records and

388
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,119
observation and then we had as

389
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:33,839
environmental data or variables we had

390
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,119
uh climatic data and uh soil data for

391
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:39,399
this uh project okay so we generate

392
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:42,079
these stack models uh to estimate the

393
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,559
number of species in each uh Flora we

394
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,599
considered uh at these uh um six uh

395
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:49,319
different

396
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:52,678
scales so then we put the two together

397
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:55,319
and we try to uh to see how well they uh

398
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:58,919
correlate okay starting with caasi what

399
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:01,519
we see is that uh if we uh pull all

400
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,080
extends those uh six or eight different

401
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:07,679
extents we have uh if we pull them

402
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,759
together we get um a good correlation I

403
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,038
would say uh

404
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:16,158
68 um deviation from the uh from the

405
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:18,640
slope of one quite big so it is okay

406
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:20,440
it's an okay uh correlation not not a

407
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,840
very strong correlation so correlation

408
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,120
between of observed species richness

409
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:27,599
through Flora uh and estimated species

410
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,439
richness through this U stacking of

411
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,798
ecological niche Modas

412
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:36,240
but when we start um separating by uh by

413
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:39,400
extents of floras what we see is at the

414
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,240
largest extent that uh uh 1 to 10

415
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,440
million hectares we have a high uh

416
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,919
correlation so at the largest extent

417
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,919
this seems to be a useful approach now

418
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,520
on the other end of the uh Spectrum at

419
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,880
the finest

420
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,720
extent uh abysmal let's not do this

421
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,000
let's not use ecological niche Ming and

422
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,759
the Stacked approach to estimate this is

423
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,319
richness because it's not really doing

424
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:08,839
good with pine the situation is uh not

425
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:11,798
good at all so at all extents definitely

426
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:13,959
not not working uh at the largest extent

427
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:17,798
somewhat working the res the uh

428
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,279
correlation is 56 somewhat okay but not

429
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:22,200
not a great approach uh the slope the

430
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:24,759
deviation from the slope is not uh is

431
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,720
better when we go to the smallest extent

432
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:29,558
as you expected do not do this let's not

433
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,120
do this let's not estimate species

434
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:33,519
richness with uh stacked uh with the

435
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:38,239
Stacked ecological niche modeling

436
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:39,960
approach okay so that was one way of um

437
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,440
informing the psychological Niche

438
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,319
modeling field of the um applicability

439
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,120
of this approach to estimating uh

440
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:52,038
species richness next what I want to do

441
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:54,639
is go into a slightly smaller scale and

442
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:57,480
talk about uh climatic uh Niche

443
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,520
dissimilarity for one plant species that

444
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:04,640
has two uh more morphs um so the the

445
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:07,279
question here was uh do we see uh a

446
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,080
climatic difference between uh

447
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,440
populations that have different uh

448
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:16,599
morphologies and this study is a

449
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:20,640
collaboration with uh botanists again um

450
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:24,558
um from botn from uh Genet STS from OSU

451
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,159
then uh Dana from uh and uh Diana and

452
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:31,720
naoki from um University of Alaska

453
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:37,200
Fairbanks and then geologist from from

454
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:41,000
OSU so what we did here is uh not me but

455
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,840
Janette uh examined uh two morphs of

456
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
arabidopsis Kamchatka uh and she used

457
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:50,038
the uh herbarium specimens available um

458
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,319
at uh at the University of uh Alaska so

459
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:55,599
the two uh morphs that she looked at and

460
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:58,879
that are common in uh in Kamchatka um

461
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:02,158
populations are the uh the tri Tri con

462
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,440
bearing leaves versus glabrous leaves so

463
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,720
uh smooth versus uh leaves that have uh

464
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,200
that have these um unicellular uh

465
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Tricom so she was able to find 116

466
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,319
specimens for the triom bearing morph

467
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,159
and uh 23 30 specimens for the uh

468
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,519
glabrous uh morph and this is a map of

469
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:25,960
the uh distribution of these of these

470
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,119
specimens uh she Geor referenced she and

471
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,480
and Jeff Geor referenced uh many of

472
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:32,599
these uh occurrences okay so what did we

473
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,599
do with this we took the records for the

474
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:38,959
two morphs uh environmental data again

475
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,798
and we uh we build two uh models two

476
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,640
different models for the triom bearing

477
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,798
specimens based on the triom bearing

478
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,559
specimens specimens and the glabrous uh

479
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:51,359
specimens so what we what we see is

480
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:54,440
first look at these Maps is the Trion

481
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:58,879
bearing um has a narrower distribution

482
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:02,080
than the uh glabrous um coal I'm sorry

483
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,440
Co Coastal maybe uh yes yes exactly uh

484
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,399
this is more Coastal and this is more uh

485
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,759
Inland uh species a wider distribution

486
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,038
based on the occurrences and also based

487
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,960
on our uh estimated suitability for the

488
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,158
uh

489
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,679
globers okay but then so we have a

490
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:23,480
visual of the uh climatic suitability

491
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,360
for the two mors but we want to quantify

492
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,960
how different are they really different

493
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:31,759
these two uh suitability envelopes so

494
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,759
what we did is we uh used uh uh

495
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:37,720
background similarity tests which uh

496
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:39,960
allow us to tell if uh the two morphs

497
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,319
are ecologically more similar or less

498
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,000
similar than uh expected by chance and

499
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:49,359
to do that we create 100 we created 100

500
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,278
uh replicates of these models where we

501
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:55,918
randomized uh one um data set for one

502
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,839
morph and created models and then

503
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,038
randomize the other data set for the

504
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,199
other model

505
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,119
the other morph and created model so

506
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,480
basically we have Real Models based on

507
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:12,439
real data comparing that with um random

508
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,558
models based on randomizing um taking at

509
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,120
random occurrences uh not occurrences

510
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,519
taking at random locations that are not

511
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:22,918
presences for that particular morph and

512
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:26,359
then we uh use two statistics uh shers

513
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:28,080
shers and uh eye statistic uh they basic

514
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:31,798
what they basically do is they look at

515
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:34,000
the probability of suitability for one

516
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:36,359
um morph and then the probability of su

517
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,519
suitability for the other morph at each

518
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:42,519
location in uh geography uh and they do

519
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,798
slightly different things but uh overall

520
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:48,038
they should be uh quite they should

521
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,679
provide uh a unified uh answer if we get

522
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:51,119
different answers from these two

523
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,679
different metrics it means that we are

524
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:57,519
not doing uh something right so the idea

525
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,519
here is quantifying the suitability

526
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:03,038
probability for each pixel and comparing

527
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:06,200
between the two uh morphs so what do we

528
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:09,038
get what we get is that random this is

529
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,480
the distribution of random models and

530
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:14,558
this is where our observed um overlap

531
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,519
Niche overlap or similarity between the

532
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,240
two morphs is so this is number of

533
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:20,599
replicates obviously we have just one

534
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,359
for the real models and then we have a

535
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:26,839
number of 100 each uh for the uh for the

536
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:29,079
random model so this is telling us that

537
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:32,158
sign there is a statistical

538
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:34,798
significant distinction the two morphs

539
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,159
are less similar than expected by chance

540
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,918
based on this the statistic we did the

541
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,760
same for this other statistic and we

542
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,600
obtained similar results where the um uh

543
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:47,359
Niche dissimilarity between the two

544
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:49,599
morph the two morphs was statistically

545
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,319
uh significant compared to a a null

546
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,678
distribution of these of the of these

547
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,119
values okay so what we are saying is the

548
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:59,600
two morphs are climatically

549
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,599
dissimilar um the one other way to look

550
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,719
at this is which variables contribute

551
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:06,959
most to the two models the two real

552
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,200
models for the morphs and this is this

553
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,399
is a list of the variables that uh we

554
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,519
used and what we see is that uh in bold

555
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:18,918
um we have variables that uh

556
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:22,000
cumulatively amount to 70% or more

557
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:25,038
contribution to the model gain of that

558
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,240
for that particular um morph meaning

559
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:30,798
that the the um variables in bold have

560
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,919
the highest contribution the most

561
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:36,879
important contribution to a a good model

562
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,960
fit for that morph so what we see is

563
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,159
that there is a discrepancy between

564
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,519
glabrous uh morph which has the high uh

565
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,520
has um in that highest contribution me

566
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,440
mean dunal temperature range and temper

567
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:51,119
temperature seasonality is very

568
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,159
important but not the triom bearing and

569
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,839
then going down here we have annual

570
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,000
precipitation and precipitation

571
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:59,119
seasonality for the other morph the

572
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,558
triom bearing morph so this tells us

573
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,519
that one morph is more sensitive at

574
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:05,599
least from this modeling perspective one

575
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,319
morph is more sensitive to uh

576
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,278
temperature variation and the other one

577
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:11,839
to precipitation and elevation and uh

578
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:15,880
minimum temperature of the coldest month

579
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:18,639
was in common between the two morphs

580
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,039
okay next uh I would like to talk a

581
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,480
little bit about um discrimination of

582
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:26,000
trees and then habitat structure so

583
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,919
going down this scale moving to finer

584
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,159
and finer scales uh to get to this these

585
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:35,240
questions now we are switching to um uh

586
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,559
approaches that are based on remote

587
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,399
sensing of very very big field in

588
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:43,038
Engineering in uh and geography uh and

589
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,959
we are making uh use of it just a tiny

590
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,440
bit uh there's a lot of potential to

591
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,519
develop this field just to get everyone

592
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,080
on board we have some sort of sensor can

593
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,679
be a satellite or can be a on a airplane

594
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,558
and then the what the sensor is

595
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,679
recording is the amount of light that is

596
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,079
reflected off different surfac is that

597
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,200
the Bas that's the basic of remote

598
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:06,558
sensing why is this

599
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,440
important well uh for us it's important

600
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,879
because it allows us to get data from

601
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,960
above that we don't get on the ground it

602
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,320
is accessible data if it's satellite uh

603
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,360
collected by a satellite it's uh and

604
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:21,798
it's free like lanat we have access to

605
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,359
that data we have a greater temporal

606
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:26,599
resolution because the satellite keeps

607
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:28,678
uh orbiting the Earth um so we have a

608
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:32,079
really good temporal resolution and we

609
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:35,200
do have this potential in uh extracting

610
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:39,439
biodiversity data that is of use uh to

611
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:42,278
us and just to give you some ideas um uh

612
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,159
we detect uh surf type of surface with

613
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:46,398
with remote sensing data So based on the

614
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,960
amount of light reflected we have

615
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,079
different types of uh two different

616
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,840
types of vegetation and then uh man-made

617
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:55,038
uh let's think of man-made uh surfaces

618
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:57,199
so the amount of light that is reflected

619
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,240
is basically what gets used in these uh

620
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,240
L cover classif ification if uh if you

621
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:07,679
um look at the land cover uh map also

622
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,200
very important is the amount of light

623
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,278
that is absorbed or reflected by

624
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,360
different pigments in the structure of

625
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:16,880
the plant and this is where remote

626
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:19,240
sensing becomes extremely important for

627
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,760
for us uh biologists who are interested

628
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,880
in uh plant function plant structure uh

629
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:28,278
uh plant distribution um so this is uh

630
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,000
the uh important aspect of remote

631
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:32,960
sensing now one other important aspect

632
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,119
of remote sensing is that uh there's a

633
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,200
wide variety of sensor sensors

634
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,959
collecting this information this uh

635
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,440
light amount of light that is reflected

636
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:46,440
of uh various surfaces so a

637
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:48,798
multispectral um uh sensor uh splits the

638
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,200
uh wavelength the electromagnetic

639
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:54,158
spectrum in a few distinct uh bands so

640
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,720
think of landet for example we have a

641
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,320
few distinct bands the information the

642
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,120
sensor can only process access

643
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,798
information amount of light reflected

644
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:05,439
from this one particular uh band for

645
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:08,798
example here so that's multispectral now

646
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,840
hyperspectral refers to splitting this

647
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:14,839
electromagnetic spectrum in very narrow

648
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:17,599
bands uh 10 nanometer bands so we get

649
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:22,918
hundreds of bands uh these sensors are

650
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:26,119
provide a data Rich uh um yeah data

651
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:30,480
sources that are rich in uh information

652
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:35,079
okay so one way of using this um is to

653
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,880
try to uh look at particular reflectance

654
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:39,720
of um of different uh species and in

655
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,000
this case uh

656
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:46,519
trees so here the question is can we

657
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,880
pick out uh emerging trees uh big large

658
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,000
canopy trees that are standing above uh

659
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,159
smaller trees can we pick them out

660
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,159
spectrally from one of these uh uh

661
00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:02,480
hyperspectral High uh density of of uh

662
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,960
reflected uh bands this work uh was done

663
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,319
in collaboration with excellent botanist

664
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,079
from uh from Peru and a field assistant

665
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:12,398
whose name I forgot I'm really sorry

666
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:15,240
this was a long time ago uh when I was

667
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:18,119
finishing my PhD so these are uh

668
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,679
botanist in the field then uh Greg Asner

669
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:23,158
um is um a scientist at uh Carnegie

670
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:26,120
Institution for Science and since I have

671
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:28,440
my botanist uh collaborators in field

672
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:30,638
mode I uh pictures I didn't have them in

673
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,360
more official uh pictures I decided to

674
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:35,519
go with field mode for everyone else so

675
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,798
uh Greg Asner then my former uh PhD

676
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,319
adviser and my collaborator from uh

677
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:42,359
World wildli fund and this is like I

678
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:45,000
said work that was finished as I was uh

679
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:47,158
finishing uh graduate school um so this

680
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,679
uh has been published some time ago the

681
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:52,919
study site was somewhere in Southeastern

682
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:56,519
Peru beautiful area uh also highly

683
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,880
diverse area in terms of uh tree species

684
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:03,319
and for me the interest was was a subset

685
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:06,080
a very small subset of of uh these Tre

686
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:08,000
species that are used by various uh

687
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:12,879
animal species as food resource so

688
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,038
ferous animals that need um um resources

689
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,080
uh well fruit prod produced by these

690
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,839
trees and um actually the seasonality

691
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,199
which I I will briefly

692
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:25,918
mention so these are the species of

693
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:29,240
interest um we have fabas species here

694
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:32,159
uh and I forgot the uh family for the uh

695
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,240
Brazilian nut I'm I apologize but uh we

696
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,519
have four uh taxa from uh fabes and then

697
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,319
the Brazilian nut and then a map of

698
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,519
showing uh location various points uh

699
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,558
for these uh for these species one thing

700
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:49,638
one thing to notice is uh low sample

701
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:52,359
sizes these these are hard areas to work

702
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:54,479
because they are start uh so diverse the

703
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:58,158
forest and you can walk and walk and

704
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,558
walk and not find a second emergent uh

705
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:05,440
AOA tree for example so the sample sizes

706
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:07,720
are less than ideal uh we also had um uh

707
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,320
satellite images these hyperspectral

708
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:14,240
high Bend density uh images from uh four

709
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:17,119
different times uh and you notice that

710
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,720
uh precipitation wise we had dry season

711
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:23,038
more uh uh more rain and then the wetest

712
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,159
part of the season of the um year and

713
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,558
then another from the dry so we had both

714
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:29,840
dry more dry and then one image from the

715
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:31,759
wet season which was quite impressive

716
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,199
and I was quite happy to get that one

717
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,879
because of the cloud cover it's really

718
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,679
hard to get uh images uh for uh for

719
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,440
these

720
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,080
regions getting the hyperspectral IM

721
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,399
imagy is exciting but then uh the

722
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:47,519
processing is uh really convoluted I

723
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:49,239
won't go into it I'll just say that from

724
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,759
all from that great

725
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:56,038
242 B data set we are down we were down

726
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:59,200
to 126 that we used because of various

727
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:02,000
reasons Cloud uh um atmospheric uh

728
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,159
problems uh poor signal to noise ratio

729
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,800
so so quality of information made us uh

730
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,639
reduce that initial data set by half of

731
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,879
almost and then we did various things to

732
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,119
it I'm not going to go into it but just

733
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:19,598
uh wanted to uh mention this 126

734
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:22,399
bands uh and just a view of how this

735
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:25,760
hyper Hyperion hyperspectral imagery uh

736
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:29,199
Maps so we have a crown here that is

737
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,480
almost an entire pixel 30 by 30 m uh

738
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,239
another one that is almost 30 by 30 m

739
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,079
and then we have a p a tree here that is

740
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:40,039
not a full pixel it is split uh between

741
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,320
uh four different pixels so we were

742
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:46,398
focusing on these pixels that

743
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,119
represented more than 40% of the crown

744
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:51,838
uh of a single uh tree and then this is

745
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,480
a a spectral profile with the bends

746
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:56,838
removed the one uh the uh uh remaining

747
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,519
126 narrow bands that we kept in the

748
00:34:56,838 --> 00:34:59,960
analysis

749
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:03,159
okay so we did a linear discriminant

750
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,159
function analysis of these 126 bands we

751
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,480
initially did a stepwise uh selection

752
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:09,679
procedure procedure so we we used only

753
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,440
the most informative of these

754
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:15,679
126 and we got really good uh

755
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,480
classification errors um meaning really

756
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,399
low classification errors so what you

757
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,559
see is for one uh tree species that it's

758
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,760
actually a we couldn't identify to the

759
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:28,920
uh to the species level so we use the

760
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:32,960
genus um we have for this one taxon we

761
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:35,079
have uh classification errors meaning

762
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,800
that the linear discriminant function

763
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:40,480
analysis was not able to spectrally

764
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,560
identify uh the individuals that well

765
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,119
but we also had only four individuals so

766
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,078
it's pushing the limits of of this

767
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,119
analysis and then for the Brazilian

768
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,400
treut we had in one of the time frames

769
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,480
remember we had four different images we

770
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,318
had um we had

771
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,280
error okay and just to show you uh the

772
00:35:56,318 --> 00:36:01,838
two profiles for for the um various

773
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,839
individuals but we this we do see

774
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:08,599
differences in the these uh spectral

775
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:12,799
curves we also see temporal variation uh

776
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:15,800
within a um a taxon so here is appoa in

777
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,240
July and in December different different

778
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:22,318
Spectra uh and that difference it uh was

779
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:24,879
Quantified with a canonical analysis so

780
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:27,719
what we see is that based on the uh

781
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,680
season that these images are collected

782
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:33,598
Spectra group in uh various uh parts of

783
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:36,159
the canonical space what this means is

784
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,359
we don't have a spectral signature that

785
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,039
is species specific at all times and we

786
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:43,358
can use that spectral signature to

787
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:46,679
identify a tree it is uh season

788
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:48,440
based okay lastly the habitat structure

789
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,039
this is going to be very fast because I

790
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,400
don't have a lot of information we've

791
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,920
just started to work on this and this is

792
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,200
with my PhD student Cassandra uh who

793
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,240
took on this challenge of learning how

794
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:02,960
to use use uh liar uh terrestrial liar

795
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:05,318
to uh quantify vegetation architecture

796
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,679
for one particular uh species uh bird

797
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:09,800
species that she's interested in so this

798
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,239
is the bird species this is a a general

799
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,560
view of the shrubland grassland ecotone

800
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,919
in Oklahoma and this is what she's

801
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:20,078
trying to

802
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,358
quantify um the uh liar or light

803
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,400
detection and ranging what what it does

804
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:28,440
is it sends pulses out and then uh

805
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:33,559
measures the time it takes for the HS to

806
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:36,358
to uh reach the um the sensor again so

807
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:38,639
based on that if we think of a laser a

808
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:42,358
lar that goes or laser beam that goes

809
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:45,039
from above uh this uh this particular uh

810
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:49,199
structure will have this form where

811
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:51,279
there's more returns um when it hits a a

812
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,919
part of the tree and less returns when

813
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,079
it goes through between uh two

814
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,838
trees now we can do this from above but

815
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:02,318
we can do also this from from uh the

816
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:05,239
ground and this is where we where our

817
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:08,519
interest lies for now how uh can we do

818
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:11,519
this terrestrial scanning of of bushes

819
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:13,039
and quantify vegetation structure and

820
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,280
some these are some of the variables

821
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,480
that we hope to uh take out of this

822
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,680
these uh clouds of points that we get

823
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,559
mean shrub height shrub volume folage uh

824
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:25,799
foliage profile

825
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:28,920
yes on the on this this is distance from

826
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:33,160
the from the scanner for

827
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:35,720
the uh this is how much time it takes

828
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:37,920
for the for the beam to get back to the

829
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:42,679
pulse to get back to the to the

830
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:45,559
sensor so it's time the time is um is uh

831
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:48,440
converted to

832
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:50,279
distance okay so uh we don't have any

833
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,760
answers this is what we we've been doing

834
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,560
this summer collecting data uh very

835
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,560
difficult Logistics we can talk about

836
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:59,838
later if you are interested but what we

837
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:02,239
are doing is we are scanning one way and

838
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:06,400
then scanning another way to get a full

839
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:10,399
360 view of of the vegetation uh from

840
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,920
this point uh all the way 500 M uh

841
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,400
distance and what we get are for now

842
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,358
pretty pictures uh this is a a point

843
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,480
Cloud where vegetation is classified so

844
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:23,279
we get rid of uh soil or any other um

845
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,079
atmospherics anything that is not

846
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,040
vegetation and this is a profile of uh

847
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,280
one of the uh stud sites this is another

848
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:34,480
uh pretty image so far no qu

849
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,000
quantitative uh information but this

850
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,119
shows um vegetation height classified so

851
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,159
the the lightest green is the highest

852
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:47,318
vegetation and the darkest or the brown

853
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:49,759
uh pixels are uh the shortest vegetation

854
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:51,199
so we can get vegetation uh height for

855
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,400
now from these

856
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:56,399
images okay so what I tried to do was

857
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,119
show you an example at Large Scale of

858
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,318
ecological niche model

859
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:04,240
um uh of uh estimating um species

860
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:06,559
richness and what we see is that at

861
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:09,759
least for the two families we studied uh

862
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:12,838
fine scale do not do this large scale uh

863
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,680
caasi works better than uh

864
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:20,000
Pac um then moving on to a more Regional

865
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:22,799
scale We compare the uh morphology of

866
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,440
one species to different morphs uh and

867
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,839
the uh potential adaptation to uh

868
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,119
different environments and what we

869
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:31,440
showed was was that uh we have two

870
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,240
morphs that are climat statistically

871
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,599
they are climatically uh dissimilar and

872
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:40,279
then here we were able to identify tree

873
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,680
uh Spectra well trees uh based on

874
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:46,000
Spectra but there is seasonal variation

875
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:48,639
so we cannot use one spectral profile to

876
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,400
uh just go there and uh and map uh

877
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:53,920
species it has to be uh season specific

878
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,800
and then habitat we don't know yet uh we

879
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,318
are still in the process of gathering

880
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,000
data and making sense of it

881
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:04,239
but in general what I want to close with

882
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,960
is say that these types of approaches uh

883
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:09,239
ecological niche modeling for example

884
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,720
allows us to basically extend the uh

885
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:13,919
amount of information we can uh we can

886
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:16,000
gather from from occurrent data and

887
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,200
environmental data so it allows us to

888
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,440
learn a bit more about ecological

889
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:23,358
requirements climatic requirements uh

890
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,280
for uh for particular species so we hope

891
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,039
that this improves our understanding of

892
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,440
species distributions why species are

893
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:32,079
where are and then uh at fine scale with

894
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,800
these remote sensing approaches what we

895
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,160
are trying to get at is more of the

896
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:41,240
species function uh locally and

897
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:46,679
interactions uh in um more of a habitat

898
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:46,679
uh plant animal uh interaction type any

899
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,760
questions this has been a production of
