1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,140
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,790
University alright so seriously my name

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,160
is Chris Fernandez fourth-year student

4
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:12,539
with Michael Mazurek and you can tell

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,710
from the title I mean I talked with you

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:15,479
today about how we're trying to leverage

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,210
genomics and our squash breeding program

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,500
I could have also easily called it gain

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,679
from three cycles of genomic selection

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,050
and squash but that seemed less exciting

11
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:27,420
so I find that most people aren't super

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,399
well acquainted squash so I figure I'd

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,219
include some fun facts the front here so

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,469
squash we want to talk about squash are

15
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,750
usually talking about three cultivated

16
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,570
species species that we eat that we work

17
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:44,250
with and those are curative pepo which

18
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,320
is there we go through the people which

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,899
is your acorn delicata pumpkin

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,549
jack-o'-lantern type of squash Jakarta

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,280
Machado which is like your butternut and

22
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:56,640
we have the Hubbard group and others in

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,198
maxima and so these are the three main

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,730
squash that work with these are examples

25
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:01,320
of winter squash so there are two kinds

26
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,390
of squash winter squash in summer squash

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,680
winter squash you eat mature summer

28
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,450
squash you eat immature like zucchini

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,740
and so I'm also gonna be talking our

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,439
exclusively going to be talking about

31
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:12,329
winter squash and so yeah squash has

32
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,868
recently been sequenced all of three

33
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:18,030
genomes um it's got like a super small a

34
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,680
rabid offices sized genome but like 20

35
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,259
chromic pairs of chromosomes just kind

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,880
of cool um other fact that i want to

37
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,069
point out is squashed already like

38
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,170
overflowing with nutrition do you eat a

39
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,699
half cup of squash you get 110 percent

40
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,790
of what you need a vitamin A that you

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,990
needed for the day so when we talk about

42
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,189
breeding like improving squash fruit

43
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:37,170
Paul you're mostly talking about making

44
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,000
it more appealing to consumers so that

45
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,310
they'll take they eat something that is

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,959
nutritious for them

47
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,460
I just said squash fruit quality when I

48
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,728
talk about fruit quality and squash I'm

49
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,589
talking about color sugar and starch so

50
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,539
color is mostly dictated by a carotenoid

51
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,570
content and squash fruit if you can

52
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:56,759
measure its HPLC or with color immature

53
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:59,158
sugars um effect sweetness of the squash

54
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,310
fruits use a reflector to measure that

55
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,479
and then starch affects texture and we

56
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,929
measure that with dry matter which is

57
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:09,389
highly correlated trait for that and so

58
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:11,068
our main project goals as I mentioned

59
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,809
are to use genomics and integrating that

60
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:14,339
into our breeding program so today I'm

61
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,140
also gonna be focusing on how are you

62
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,739
how we used you know in the current

63
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:22,229
selection to in our program I'm also

64
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,700
doing work it's more at aimed at

65
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,068
understanding squash fruit quality or

66
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,629
whether its components how are they

67
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:29,518
inherited I probably won't have time to

68
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:33,239
get to that today so mostly about

69
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,409
genomic slash and stuff so like I said

70
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,939
we're talking about how we've

71
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:39,239
implemented genomic selection in our

72
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,680
program so before I get into genomic

73
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,539
selection I want to talk briefly about

74
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,450
what the phenotypic collection cycle

75
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:47,489
looks like so it's a year-long cycle we

76
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:49,768
have one cycle of selection that happens

77
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:52,950
after we phenotype so we have to grow

78
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:55,259
squash in the field we get the fruit we

79
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:56,669
bring those fruit inside these are like

80
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,620
50-pound bags of squash that we hand

81
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:59,879
carried low into the truck and bring

82
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,730
inside so I like to say that squash

83
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,219
green is a full body workout so we feel

84
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:06,659
type it at the fruit stage just means

85
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,939
that we only select on the female parent

86
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:11,759
and you only have one cycle of selection

87
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,469
it's very labor intensive but the main

88
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,849
problem with squash is that it's the

89
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:17,400
Hummer of the plant world

90
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:20,068
so squash consumes tons of resources and

91
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,569
takes up tons of space so this is a

92
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:22,318
squash field here it might look like it

93
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,078
has a lot of plans

94
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,869
that's only 200 plants so we can't have

95
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,150
super huge populations also in the

96
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,939
greenhouse same problem this is like 20

97
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,650
plants here maybe and then storage this

98
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:36,239
is one experiment that we need to

99
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,150
harvest and ever that we need to process

100
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,789
before it rots so space and time

101
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,349
constraints are all issues that we

102
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:45,060
really have to try to deal with in

103
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,139
swashb reading more so I think than a

104
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,909
lot of the crops um

105
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:50,289
one way that word so we're trying to

106
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,849
implement genomic selection to try to

107
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:54,219
sort of get around some of these

108
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:56,379
problems so we're using genomic

109
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:58,449
selection to where genotyping at this

110
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,859
stage before a plant and then we can get

111
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,329
the data back and make selections before

112
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,270
flowering so we're controlling both

113
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,320
parents and then also we're doing

114
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,719
another cycle of selection in the

115
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,099
greenhouse so we can get two cycles of

116
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:11,800
selection per year and control of both

117
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:13,180
parents so that's how and also at some

118
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,640
point we update the model because we get

119
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,840
phenotypes as we're going so this is

120
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,019
sort of how we're trying to use Joma

121
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,399
collection overview we're doing it we

122
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,230
didn't buy principal because it's easy

123
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,399
to start population to do it in and you

124
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,439
know it's already enough of a challenge

125
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,879
for us to try to integrate this squash

126
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:30,370
program so I figured we just keep it

127
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,168
simple or doing with a current selection

128
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,350
scheme with 200 plans so it's popular

129
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:38,079
slightly top 10% for bricks try matter

130
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:41,050
and color values and once again keep it

131
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,639
simple keep it G blow up doing multiple

132
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,220
traits so we use the multiple trait

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,560
model where we're basically selecting on

134
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,419
one value at the end which is just equal

135
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,620
weighting of all three of these fruit

136
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:52,418
quality trait values that we get from

137
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,590
the model so that's how we're doing

138
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:58,810
selection so f2 between Honey Nut and

139
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:00,489
bugle we chose those because we've used

140
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,228
them in our program a lot and you drive

141
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,240
some very nice F stick lines from them

142
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:05,649
so we know there's potential so that's

143
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,439
why it's perfect test for our genomic

144
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:10,089
selection pilot study feed Civic data

145
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,550
the main takeaway here is that all of

146
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:14,409
our traits are normally distributed

147
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,090
quantitative traits they're correlated

148
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,220
in favorable directions so we should be

149
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:20,469
able to get high bricks high dry matter

150
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,080
and then high color value which is what

151
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:26,410
we want so sort of what we're looking

152
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:28,889
for here some very elegant genetic

153
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,020
parameter figures for you

154
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,209
bricks dry matter have similar

155
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:36,250
moderately no kind of low here debility

156
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:39,159
is color value a slightly higher

157
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,288
heritability and all the traits as we

158
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,240
would expect are gently correlated

159
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:45,279
defeated before they're also gently

160
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,340
correlated this is just from the multi

161
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:51,959
trait model and get the head

162
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:54,060
um this wonderful jiwa cos slide here is

163
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,579
supposed to show you that those traits

164
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,290
don't really have any major effect low

165
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:01,829
size so it makes sense to use genomic

166
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:04,139
selection in this situation so then I

167
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:06,149
have some cross validation results so we

168
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,259
have the base population and then

169
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:09,829
another population that we used to

170
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,909
retrain the models see we have a

171
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:15,418
moderately strong cross-validation

172
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,130
values so can't do super good super well

173
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:19,680
we can do we do okay especially in this

174
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:20,790
only retrain the model we had some

175
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,959
better data I think we're able to do a

176
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:27,210
better job so we actually did selection

177
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,339
too so we we have crossed by a shy

178
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:30,509
Cruces and we set up the scheme so I did

179
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,199
one R I did one around a few to the

180
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:35,399
selection followed by three rounds of

181
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,829
genomic selection and then this year I

182
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,228
grew out all from remnant seed the

183
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:42,439
populations at three field sites

184
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:48,159
randomized complete block design look at

185
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:51,430
gain from selection so these are

186
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,860
results so here we have three

187
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,930
populations block two three locations

188
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,740
sorry about two weeks with cut and

189
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:02,170
organic and we have a base population up

190
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,000
through the final selected population so

191
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:08,620
space population after future big

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,879
selection after an intermediate showing

193
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,399
selection around and then the final

194
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,139
round of selection and so you can see in

195
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,060
most locations it looks like we enriched

196
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:19,750
for individuals with higher index values

197
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,399
so this is we don't have this population

198
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,810
in this environment but for the most

199
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,810
part it looks like general collection

200
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,100
work for us we were able to improve

201
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,050
enriched for higher index value

202
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,700
individuals I don't have a picture of it

203
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,110
and I don't think in the slides but also

204
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:33,789
if you look at each of the traits of

205
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,020
bricks try matter at a value you also

206
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,480
see that each of the traits also

207
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:38,909
increased so increase total index but

208
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:44,950
also we increased all the traits

209
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:47,740
slightly so so we wanted to see there so

210
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:48,819
further work I mean obviously there's a

211
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,379
lot we could still do what this data

212
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,699
said so we're looking at looking at

213
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:55,420
correlated gained from selection other

214
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:57,789
traits so we measured laying with weight

215
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,379
yield traits and so we can look at what

216
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,330
happened to these traits as we selected

217
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:03,069
for fruit quality traits looking at

218
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:05,159
realized heritability a gain for cycle

219
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:07,418
you can already kind of see that but um

220
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,890
so yeah we're gonna be doing all that

221
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:11,259
stuff looking at inbreeding that sort of

222
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,879
thing also I save pedigrees from this

223
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:14,379
stuff so we can look at how well better

224
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,360
you slept or using just pedigree

225
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,009
information we've done for us use that

226
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,770
to compare with genomic selection and

227
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:23,709
then squash green 3.0 which I say is

228
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:26,079
figurin dirtier so bigger I mean larger

229
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:29,079
population size and earlier just cheaper

230
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,449
lower quality DNA extractions doing more

231
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:33,218
plans so I think we're kind of looking

232
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,598
because we have sort of low lower

233
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,219
prediction accuracy is doing more of a

234
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,050
genomic enrichment situation where we're

235
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:40,900
screening you know a couple hundred

236
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:42,549
plants as squash seedlings throwing out

237
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:46,299
like the bottom 50% and proceeding from

238
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:48,159
there and then also looking at looking

239
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:49,839
at some of these post storage quality

240
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,969
traits that we have in squash this is an

241
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,530
example of hollow neck which is not

242
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,620
desirable and I would see inside this

243
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:58,149
about squash four months special storage

244
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,950
conditions so we could develop

245
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,019
prediction miles for this trade that

246
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,940
would be super cool so

247
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:09,850
sort of we're looking to go I'm

248
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,330
I have a minute all right so really

249
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,580
quickly

250
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,500
just so you know we're also interested

251
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,530
in understanding fruit quality in Cuba

252
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,690
and we're interested in understanding

253
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,329
how this varies within species and

254
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,390
between species also you know just look

255
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,920
at how we can potentially bring together

256
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:29,529
different species to get what we want in

257
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,149
squash quality and so the experiment

258
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:33,970
I'll just tell you really quick as we

259
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:35,350
did we have data from different time

260
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,930
points and squash development at

261
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,909
different cultivars we did a bunch of

262
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:42,159
while we did a bunch of quality trait

263
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:43,240
measurements look at profiles and or

264
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,969
combine that with sheen expression

265
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,590
profiles to try to understand better

266
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,660
what's driving squash fruit quality

267
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:54,820
within species in between species so

268
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:56,350
that I'd like to acknowledge my adviser

269
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,110
Michael Mazurek my committee overly

270
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:02,050
leaves here right now Jessica Kowski

271
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:05,860
who's in the Philippines also the

272
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:10,000
chorim's Uruk lab our wonderful lab tech

273
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:11,139
field tech and the rest and also various

274
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,929
other individuals who've helped me along

275
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:16,840
the way and our funding source for this

276
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:19,359
grant from the USDA nifA grant and I

277
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,850
guess with that I'll take any questions

278
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:27,479
that you have

279
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:27,479
[Applause]

280
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:36,240
so the question is when how often we

281
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:38,639
retrain the model and one of the visuals

282
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,870
that I used to do that so I had Asterix

283
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,139
in here somewhere but they disappeared

284
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,970
but here we train the model initially

285
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,159
and then this is a green house

286
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,959
generation and then this is a field

287
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,879
generation so we retrained at this point

288
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,309
and that did these two this last cycle

289
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,110
using the retrained model so this is we

290
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:59,309
retrained at this point here and

291
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,899
actually I ended up just using the c2

292
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,849
population as a new training population

293
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,799
I didn't try to combine the two

294
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,750
populations because there's some the

295
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,639
data quality was just a lot higher in

296
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,440
this population that specifically the

297
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,659
GBS libraries were a lot better we got

298
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,089
higher quality genotypes so I just

299
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:21,879
decided to go with that so that's what

300
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:26,770
we end up using narky I have

301
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:28,509
that yet so I mean look at the raw data

302
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,470
but there's some outliers and stuff in

303
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:32,799
there so it's kind of hard to tell

304
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,850
whether we've reduced variance and I'm

305
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,799
sure there's probably been some

306
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,019
inbreeding though that also might be

307
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:40,629
part of the reason in addition to higher

308
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:41,799
quality while we have maybe slightly

309
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:43,149
better prediction accuracy as we still

310
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,429
have variation where they're more

311
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:48,519
related so that could be a reason that I

312
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:50,019
have higher accuracy is here but yeah I

313
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,110
haven't looked at that yeah we

314
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:54,720
definitely will look at that Thanks all

315
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,300
right let's thank Chris one more time

316
