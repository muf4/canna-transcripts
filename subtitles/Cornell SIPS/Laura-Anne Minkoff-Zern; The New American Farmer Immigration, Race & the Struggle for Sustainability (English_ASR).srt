appreciate you coming

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,678
i'm going to go ahead and share my

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,879
slides

15
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,079
so thank you so much for that

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,320
introduction i am laura ann minkoff cern

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,320
i teach at syracuse university in our

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,878
food studies program

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,320
i'm also the graduate director there so

20
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,640
i'll just do a little

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,640
um plug on our program because it's

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
still relatively new

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,960
but we teach about food studies and food

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,719
systems we have an undergraduate program

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,039
as well as a master's degree program

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,800
and it's a mix of the critical social

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,879
sciences and then students also get to

28
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,640
take advantage of the maxwell policy

29
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,560
school as well as some students doing

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,840
some course work at esf

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,320
that want a bit more of the applied

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,960
agriculture side of things but we think

33
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,118
it's a pretty

34
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,959
unique program i feel very lucky to have

35
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,719
landed here in syracuse and

36
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,959
and i get to teach about food and food

37
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,438
systems and sustainability

38
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,798
all the time which is um really

39
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,599
wonderful for me

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,880
um but i'm gonna talk a bit about the

41
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,599
research that i've been doing

42
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,599
for the past i guess the book now by the

43
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,158
time the book actually gets published

44
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,359
and then all the writing period um so i

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,759
really finished the research

46
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,640
about three years ago um the book came

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,280
out last

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,560
at the end of last year called the new

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,399
american farmer

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,000
immigration race and the struggle for

51
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,960
sustainability

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,040
and this is just a photo of the book

53
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,879
it's with mit press and i always like to

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,719
tell people that you can get it

55
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,798
open access you can download it for free

56
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,280
it's one of the books that mit

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,118
made open source last year so especially

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,478
for grad students that you know

59
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,399
can't just buy every book they want to

60
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:06,959
read i'm really proud to have it

61
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,959
available

62
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,598
to anyone that wants to read it if you

63
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,199
want to download it from the press site

64
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,878
that is of course if you find this talk

65
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,238
interesting enough that you want to hear

66
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,479
more

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,520
um so this book and the talk today

68
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,039
um is the study they did over the course

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,319
of about eight years

70
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,759
um looking at latino and latina

71
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,919
immigrant farmers in the united states

72
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:35,120
and i've i've chosen to

73
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,958
at least for this publication use the

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,719
term latino and latina rather than

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
latinx simply because that's how people

76
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,680
identified themselves to me in

77
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,280
interviews and i wanted to

78
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,680
to honor how people were identifying

79
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,039
themselves um

80
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,640
so my study is qualitative

81
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,959
i'll go a little bit into my methods and

82
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,000
how i did my research in a minute

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,759
um but i do always like to point that

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,158
while my study is qualitative

85
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,439
it's interview based and i can't make a

86
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,719
lot of quantitative

87
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,959
claims based on my own research it

88
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,439
is backed up by quantitative research

89
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,719
done by the usda census

90
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,560
so my study looked at latino and latina

91
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,560
immigrant farmers united states and i

92
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,598
specifically was doing research with

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,878
farm workers that identified as

94
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:26,798
as immigrants as latino

95
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:30,239
primarily from mexico

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,360
and the census actually looks

97
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,840
at a broader scale of

98
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,879
of self-identified latino or hispanic

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,439
farmers

100
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,439
um but what i found in my study and what

101
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,919
is identified in the agricultural census

102
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,280
or this

103
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,199
is the same which is that they are a

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,479
growing group of farmers in the united

105
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,280
states

106
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,238
um and while the census is broader in

107
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,080
terms of not

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,680
everyone that's interviewed is first

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,080
generation so in my study i looked

110
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,159
specifically at first generation

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,000
people that came and worked in farm work

112
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,359
and then started their own farms

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,919
um what we also see from the broader

114
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,200
numbers

115
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,919
is that um latino and hispanic farmers

116
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,759
are increasing and they are the largest

117
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,438
most quickly growing

118
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,199
self-identified ethnic group in

119
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,798
agriculture today so i think that's

120
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,000
really significant and it backs up

121
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,798
everything that i'm going to talk about

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,399
today

123
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,239
in terms of why we should care about

124
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,198
this group of farmers what they bring to

125
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,478
agriculture

126
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,120
and the types of shifts that we're

127
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,039
seeing as well as the ways that

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,280
they are disadvantaged the challenges

129
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,199
that they face and what we can possibly

130
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,799
do to better incorporate them into

131
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,800
agrarian systems in the u.s

132
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,639
so why this is really important if we're

133
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,439
looking

134
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,400
at broader shifts in u.s agriculture we

135
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,600
know that half of all farm operators

136
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:54,478
are reaching retirement

137
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,639
and so we really do have a gap in terms

138
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,560
of who wants to farm and who's willing

139
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,240
to farm in the united states if we are

140
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
interested in maintaining

141
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
local agriculture and regional

142
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,840
agriculture systems

143
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,439
we've seen that most people born into

144
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,519
farming families in the us are not

145
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,839
interested in taking on the farm

146
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,799
obviously we probably everyone here

147
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,799
already knows why

148
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,800
it's really economically difficult to

149
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,840
survive in farming in the u.s

150
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,800
in the global labor market or the global

151
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,879
market as well as the amount of labor

152
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,520
input and how physically challenging and

153
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,639
difficult

154
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:31,038
it is as a business um

155
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,840
at the same time we see a higher demand

156
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,079
um for

157
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,918
organic food than we can even grow in

158
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,120
the u.s and i'll you'll see why that's

159
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,159
significant

160
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,680
um as well as a higher demand for

161
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,759
regional and local food which

162
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,959
arguably is growing during the pandemic

163
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,600
as we saw kind of

164
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,519
people being there the fear of supply

165
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,759
chain shutting down

166
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,680
and while that didn't happen um the

167
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,240
demand for things like csas and local

168
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
food

169
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,240
um seems to be going up um

170
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,198
and yet right we don't have the farmers

171
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,918
coming in

172
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,759
um with the experience and interest in

173
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,240
continuing

174
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,000
these the types of medium and

175
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,240
small-scale farms that i'll talk about

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,639
right so arguably what we have is

177
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,879
a population of farm workers that have

178
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,120
the experience and skill in farming

179
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,240
many of whom actually want to own farms

180
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,639
in the u.s

181
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,038
but don't have the capital and other

182
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,639
types of advantages to start those farms

183
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,159
and so that's kind of the gap that we're

184
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,879
seeing and some of the ways that

185
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,479
immigrants

186
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,399
could be filling the gap and in some

187
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,399
ways are

188
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,679
so i like to start with one of the

189
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,719
quotes this is one of the quotes in the

190
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
beginning in the book

191
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,919
by one of the farmers that i met in

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,399
washington state

193
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,079
and i always ask the farmers you know

194
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,719
why are they doing this a bit of their

195
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,519
story

196
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,199
um and i'll talk much more about you

197
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,399
know that they do this against so many

198
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
odds

199
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,918
um but to describe what their motivation

200
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,478
was and

201
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,038
um this one farmer said to me and her

202
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,519
farm is

203
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,879
mariposa farm of course which means uh

204
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,799
butterfly in spanish

205
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,079
she said we wanted to name it mariposa

206
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,240
because you know the story of the

207
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,318
monarchs the monarch butterflies

208
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,000
they need to fly from mexico to canada

209
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,879
some of them die crossing the border to

210
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,560
reach canada

211
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,478
some of the parents die during the trip

212
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,160
but children know how to come back

213
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,918
i think we as latinos have a lot in

214
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,479
common with butterflies because in order

215
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,159
to be here we have to cross the borders

216
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,318
and sadly a lot of times families lose

217
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,840
their loved ones but their children here

218
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,280
the children who are born here always

219
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,079
have the need of knowing their parents

220
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,638
roots

221
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,598
and always go looking for it and that

222
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,680
represented

223
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,800
a lot of the narratives that i heard

224
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,879
from different farmers

225
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
is the ways that starting a farm in the

226
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,079
u.s was not just a business but a way to

227
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,639
establish roots

228
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,758
to revisit the traditions and culture

229
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,000
that they had been raised in

230
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,360
in mexico and also to teach their

231
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,038
children about who they were

232
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,720
and where they were from and so i met

233
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,279
with um the

234
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,479
small farm program at cornell this

235
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,559
morning and

236
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,800
um someone in the meeting said you know

237
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,839
is there motivation for them outside of

238
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,280
um economic motivation and yes that was

239
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,038
largely what i found is there was

240
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,679
something more meaningful to them

241
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,478
as to why they were continuing to farm

242
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
you know against

243
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:13,839
so many odds

244
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,478
um so to scale out a bit um the larger

245
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,160
book project

246
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,079
i'm not going to answer all of these

247
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,439
questions today because that's too many

248
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,680
questions to answer

249
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,639
but what i write about in the book is i

250
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,160
look at

251
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,400
right why are they starting their farms

252
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,840
despite challenges i look a lot of the

253
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,360
historic context

254
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,879
that's determined their position in the

255
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,959
current agri-food system what's the

256
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,958
relationship between slavery

257
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,958
african-american farmers and immigrant

258
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,478
farmers today

259
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,879
i look specifically at how race

260
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,959
ethnicity and their citizenship

261
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,559
affect agricultural practices and their

262
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,639
identity

263
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,479
and what this transition from workers to

264
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,399
owners as they say my work really

265
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,159
focuses specifically on farm workers

266
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,159
starting their own farms

267
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,360
um what does it mean for potentially

268
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,199
labor justice

269
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,959
so i started out my research

270
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,320
specifically working with farm workers

271
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,239
and my dissertation

272
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,920
and i was really interested i still am

273
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,278
very interested in farm

274
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:14,559
worker and farm labor issues um

275
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,679
and that was the the lead into this

276
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,199
project

277
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:21,919
um and then of course what do

278
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,240
does this group of farmers mean for

279
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,519
alternative agri-food movements

280
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,039
what might it mean to the types of

281
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,720
more sustainable and socially just

282
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,958
changes that we'd like to see in

283
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,720
agriculture today

284
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,239
so i'm going to narrow it down today to

285
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,080
just three of those questions

286
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,720
um so why are they starting their own

287
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,519
farms how does their race ethnicity and

288
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,080
citizenship

289
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,278
affect their practices and identity and

290
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,360
then what's their role

291
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:54,559
in these growing food movements

292
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,039
of course there's a lot of um literature

293
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,479
that

294
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,639
influences me um and the work that i do

295
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,879
um in a way i bring together a lot of

296
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:06,319
work in agrarian political economy

297
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,200
with uh oncology with work on agrarian

298
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,560
cultural

299
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,278
um and racial identity and so the

300
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,838
importance

301
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,320
not only of kind of structures in

302
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,440
agriculture in terms of class structure

303
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,800
um and class transition but also the

304
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,920
importance of

305
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,799
um identity and culture to agrarian

306
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,719
transition

307
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,039
as well as the ways that food and

308
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,839
agriculture and food waste are a form of

309
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,039
resistance

310
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,320
to the industrial food system to

311
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:40,000
the ways that people are exploited and

312
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,079
oppressed in the food system as well as

313
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,240
the ways that people have historically

314
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,838
lost their own food traditions

315
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,278
and so i draw on a lot of different

316
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,279
scholars that look at

317
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,278
food as a form of cultural resistance

318
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,320
um so this is a bit about where i did my

319
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,239
research

320
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,680
so it was across the united states

321
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,680
and in a lot of ways this research

322
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,399
really followed me and my own

323
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,399
path in life in a very practical way i

324
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,159
started my research in the central coast

325
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,360
the northern central coast of california

326
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:16,559
when i was doing dissertation work

327
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,519
in uh largely monterey salinas

328
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,319
santa cruz counties in california when i

329
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,360
came

330
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,480
to the east coast um to do my

331
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,159
postdoc work in baltimore i started

332
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,159
doing some work in the northern neck of

333
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,919
virginia about three hours south of

334
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,159
washington dc

335
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,599
um and then once i had established

336
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,120
really two

337
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,040
field sites and started doing some

338
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,879
presentations what i found is

339
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,240
different people in conferences and

340
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:43,600
different places would reach out to me

341
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,879
and say you need to come here you need

342
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,480
to look at this community

343
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,480
i'll host you i'll introduce you to

344
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,920
people but there are latino farmers

345
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,519
where i'm working too

346
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,958
and that's how i really ended up in

347
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,000
washington um

348
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,838
and minnesota um and the hudson valley

349
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,679
um and of course this is by no means

350
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,880
comprehensive of all the places across

351
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,319
the united states

352
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,480
that i think immigrant farmers and

353
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,959
latino farmers specifically are

354
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,320
succeeding and have pockets um there are

355
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,039
so many more places they could have done

356
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,440
the work

357
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,240
but at a certain point i wanted to write

358
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,920
the book

359
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,680
so um they what i found is really

360
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,519
i think in most areas that have large

361
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,638
farm worker immigrant farm worker

362
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,360
populations

363
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,519
where they have proximity to an urban

364
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,120
area for direct sales

365
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,759
you will find immigrant farming

366
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,759
communities

367
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,320
um so as i said the this work really

368
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,799
looks at this

369
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,879
agriculture agricultural transition or

370
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,719
agrarian transitions so

371
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,559
everyone that i interviewed that was

372
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,680
farming here in the us

373
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,159
um started out in some way farming in

374
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,638
mex

375
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,159
the the vast majority were from mexico

376
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,159
all different parts of mexico

377
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,679
so a few i interviewed were from central

378
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:57,600
america as well

379
00:12:53,679 --> 00:13:00,078
um but most of them started off farming

380
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,000
um in their life in their home country

381
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,759
they came here to work in the fields

382
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,600
mostly in industrial monocrop

383
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,958
agriculture depending on whatever region

384
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,399
they were in

385
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,159
some of them were migrant workers in the

386
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,839
u.s some of them had worked in northern

387
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,879
mexico before they came here

388
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,079
but largely we're going from

389
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,278
very diversified small scale

390
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:23,679
agriculture to monocrop

391
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,720
industrial scale agriculture in the

392
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,319
united states

393
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,160
and then they were returning to some

394
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,800
form of

395
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,879
small to medium scale farming and

396
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,719
diversified farming again in the u.s so

397
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,838
they went from farmer to farm worker to

398
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,240
farmer

399
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,639
again and all of them really identified

400
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,240
as a farmer throughout that entire

401
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,480
path and so i think a lot of farm

402
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,839
workers in the u.s identify as farmers

403
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,519
even when they don't

404
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,199
have their own land right even when they

405
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,560
don't have access to make those types of

406
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,319
decisions

407
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,479
and a lot of people would ask me when i

408
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,120
started this work is how can someone

409
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,720
do farm work on someone's farm all day

410
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,240
and then have their own farm in the

411
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,240
evening because many of them had not

412
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,759
made enough money to quit their day jobs

413
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,519
and so they'd do their own farming in

414
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,000
the evening and the weekends

415
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
um but what i saw was that what they did

416
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,559
in their day job was

417
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,560
very very different than what they were

418
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,958
doing after work

419
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,159
so in the salinas valley they might be

420
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,319
picking strawberries

421
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,439
all day long with a crew or planting

422
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,360
garlic something

423
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,360
a very very repetitive task where they

424
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,120
didn't get to make any decisions

425
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,959
about how the crop was planted what they

426
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,320
were planning when it was picked

427
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,479
right nothing they were workers they

428
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,760
were told what to do and after work they

429
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
would go to their own cloud of land

430
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,319
which they would rent

431
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,639
or own mostly renting um

432
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,440
and they'd be with their extended family

433
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,440
um

434
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,959
they would be in charge of what was

435
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,480
planted they got to make decisions they

436
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,078
were paying attention to the weather

437
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,440
they were they were the farmer right

438
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,439
they were the decision maker

439
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,279
they were doing tons of different jobs

440
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,920
every single day as you do on a small

441
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:55,278
farm

442
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,360
and it was just an incredibly different

443
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,078
experience to them than working on

444
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,000
someone else's

445
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,439
farm and it was worth it right which

446
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,559
i'll talk about kind of why

447
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,199
why would they do this um

448
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,638
so first the story of as i've been

449
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,078
saying it's kind of this balance between

450
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,879
challenges and opportunities

451
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,078
that the farmers are experiencing so of

452
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,720
course the biggest

453
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,239
as first generation immigrants the us

454
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,278
are race and sedition

455
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,560
citizenship based um

456
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,838
so things such as language the vast

457
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,078
majority

458
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,959
spanish was their first language many of

459
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,838
them had

460
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,518
no to very little english skills in

461
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,680
california in particular and

462
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,560
some in washington state i interviewed a

463
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,958
lot of

464
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,758
self-identified mexican indigenous

465
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,439
farmers

466
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,800
so trichy and meek stucco were their

467
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,320
first languages and then they learned

468
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,359
spanish and mexico and then they were

469
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,560
trying to learn english here

470
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,560
and most had not been you know

471
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,319
beyond middle school some had not been

472
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,119
beyond elementary school so not only

473
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,639
were they not

474
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,919
reading and writing in english many of

475
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,039
them could barely read and write in

476
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,039
spanish

477
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,159
and so a real lack of formal education

478
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,319
which

479
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,000
in the united states farming is actually

480
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,800
quite bureaucratic

481
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,559
if you want to be part of a farmer's

482
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,399
market you have to fill out forms if you

483
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,159
want to own land you have to fill out

484
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,679
forms if you want a business license if

485
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,958
you want to be certified organic

486
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,559
right it's there's tons of paperwork

487
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,000
and while you know a lot of people have

488
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,559
said to me if you want to apply to loans

489
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,360
or

490
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,078
to work with any type of extension um a

491
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,639
lot of people

492
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,719
have said to me well no farmers like

493
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,600
paperwork right no one goes into farming

494
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,440
to do paperwork which of course is true

495
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,959
to have to do that level of paperwork

496
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,040
when you can't read and write in english

497
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,599
is a whole other barrier that keeps

498
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,679
farmers

499
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,600
out of accessing particular resources

500
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,838
and networks

501
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,360
as well as learning how to market in the

502
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,959
context of the united states which is

503
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,079
very different from their home

504
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,278
communities um

505
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,439
you know just the whole concept of

506
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,198
marketing and i and creating a brand and

507
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,720
these types of things

508
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,399
and then of course some of them were

509
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,680
explicitly limited

510
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,278
by citizenship status so i never asked

511
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,000
about citizenship status but i could

512
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,318
usually

513
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,640
kind of you know figure it out along the

514
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,879
lines of their immigration story

515
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,559
um you know and some people if they were

516
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,240
undocumented of course had to

517
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:18,160
similar to japanese farmers during the

518
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,279
internment period would you know turn

519
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,400
over their licenses

520
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,000
to u.s born children or neighbors or

521
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,199
have someone help them that had

522
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,240
um certification um

523
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,720
and you know many of them also would

524
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,759
experience overt discrimination which i

525
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,558
really

526
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,079
did not hear much discrimination stories

527
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:39,519
of discrimination by customers it was

528
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,240
largely by other farmers

529
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,440
and market managers and so farmers

530
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,679
market managers

531
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,519
um as well as historical discrimination

532
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,880
by the usda and i'll go a little bit

533
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,279
into that in a minute

534
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,960
um what i realized i actually didn't say

535
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,079
in the methods slide

536
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,960
um maybe i'll go back just one second

537
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,359
um is so my methods for this this was

538
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,360
all

539
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,759
um long-form interview based i

540
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,879
interviewed about 70 farmers or

541
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:10,720
70 farmers and

542
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,160
30 people in either extension

543
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,839
usda regional usda federal usda

544
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,160
um market managers non-profits and

545
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:23,279
farm incubators basically anyone i could

546
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,720
find that worked with immigrant farmers

547
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,798
and could tell me about their work with

548
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,440
them i

549
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,359
met a lot of farmers through people in

550
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,400
inc that were working in incubators

551
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:36,798
farm incubators or um

552
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,519
market managers um and then things would

553
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,000
kind of

554
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,119
um you know extend from there where i

555
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,798
would get to know these extended

556
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,558
networks family networks community

557
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,720
networks of farmers

558
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,678
um but all in all is about 100

559
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,120
interviews

560
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:54,080
over the course of um of eight years

561
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,639
and different kind of trips um to each

562
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,839
site

563
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,840
multiple trips

564
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,960
so back to kind of the obstacles or

565
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,038
limitations

566
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,640
um i always ask people if they had ever

567
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,720
reach out to extension if they'd ever

568
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,559
reach out to usda

569
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,480
and this is one farmer in california who

570
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,079
is actually a relatively successful

571
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,160
farmer she had gone through

572
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,079
the alba training program one of the

573
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,279
larger farm incubator training programs

574
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,038
in california

575
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,720
she had started her own certified

576
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,319
organic farm

577
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,880
she actually had a spot at many of the

578
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,480
farmers markets in the bay area which is

579
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,160
very competitive

580
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,919
but when i asked you know do you look

581
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,240
for

582
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,600
for grants or loans or any kind of help

583
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,798
and there are

584
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,319
you know there is help out there for

585
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,038
small-scale farmers things like hoop

586
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,119
houses

587
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,879
um you know grants to help them with

588
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,879
value-added products that type of thing

589
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,240
that a lot of small farmers in the us

590
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,000
do access and she said to me well

591
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,679
if you go to an agency and you're a

592
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,038
latino person and you're a woman

593
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,880
and you don't speak the language and you

594
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,079
don't have money and you go to an agency

595
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,360
the federal government

596
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,439
and you want to find someone to speak

597
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,879
your language how do you say this

598
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,320
they don't want to have a person to help

599
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,159
you they don't want to have a person

600
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,240
that speaks your language

601
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,440
um and as we spoke she clearly meant

602
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,440
this not um

603
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,880
you know she meant this metaphorically

604
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,480
as well right first of all there was no

605
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,039
one in the office that spoke spanish

606
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,720
even though

607
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,640
the majority of people in this these

608
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,839
rural areas in california where

609
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,400
farmworkers live

610
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,720
are spanish-speaking um but no one in

611
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,720
her local usda office spoke spanish

612
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,079
um but when she walked in nobody really

613
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,839
wanted to communicate with her because

614
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,839
they assume she's a worker

615
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,119
and i had that really affirmed when i

616
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,879
was doing my research

617
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,558
every area that i was going to interview

618
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,960
farmers i would call

619
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,879
local offices of the usda and any

620
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,120
extension if it existed

621
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,840
and i'd say can i speak with anyone who

622
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,000
works with immigrant farmers in your

623
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:50,319
region

624
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,679
and i heard multiple times well we don't

625
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,678
work with farm workers

626
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,360
um that would be the labor department

627
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,880
and i'd say no it farmers that they're

628
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,678
i've been talking to farmers and they'd

629
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,799
say well we don't know what you're

630
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,640
talking about

631
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,119
um so many times they're just completely

632
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,640
unaware that the immigrant farmers exist

633
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,558
and they don't identify

634
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,720
immigrants as farmers right it's not who

635
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,279
they see as a farmer

636
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,679
of course this is not always true i

637
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:16,879
found in washington state

638
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,440
there were a few staff at the usda

639
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,240
that grew up in farm worker families

640
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,519
themselves

641
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,359
that specifically did all the

642
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,400
translation and outreach that made it

643
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,319
their personal

644
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,679
mission to network to all the immigrant

645
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,879
farmers in the area

646
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,320
but it's only because of their own

647
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,440
personal background it's not something

648
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,119
they were being paid to do

649
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,558
or had been hired to do so if there

650
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,519
wasn't an explicit effort

651
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,519
it was not happening

652
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:48,480
and so of course this has also been um

653
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:50,079
you know seen historically structurally

654
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,000
so people are usually more familiar with

655
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,519
the pickford case the discrimination

656
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
case

657
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,000
of african-american farmers in the usda

658
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,759
but there's also a hispanic and women

659
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,679
farmers women and hispanic farmers were

660
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,200
bunched together in this claims process

661
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,798
there's also a native american farmer's

662
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,919
claims case and this one was

663
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,759
specifically um in 2000 but when i was

664
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,200
doing the early part of my research is

665
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:12,000
actually when the claims process was

666
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,440
being

667
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,798
processed so 15 years later

668
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,000
people had to hear about this

669
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:21,599
you could complain if you had been

670
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,839
discriminated against while applying for

671
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,279
a loan from 81 to 2000

672
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:26,959
which means that you would have had to

673
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:30,319
be walking into a usda

674
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,159
office um to see the um

675
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,279
the paperwork saying you know if you

676
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,480
were discriminated fill out the

677
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,678
paperwork

678
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,038
of course it's already if you've been

679
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,000
discriminated against you didn't get the

680
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:39,759
loans

681
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,038
you didn't succeed in farming it's

682
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,158
really hard to ever hear that this is

683
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,158
going on

684
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,280
but still there were many people that

685
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,400
filled out the forms

686
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,720
um successful or successfully um i

687
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,759
should say applied but not successfully

688
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,400
because

689
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,839
in the end um something like 90 of the

690
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,600
cases were thrown out

691
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,279
because they said people didn't fill out

692
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,199
the paperwork properly

693
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,960
which of course to me is really ironic

694
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,000
seeing that what one of the main

695
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,679
practical

696
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,319
barriers that people talked about was

697
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,519
the ability to fill out paperwork um

698
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,439
but in the end right there was

699
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,960
acknowledgement from the usda that this

700
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,400
discrimination had happened and that's

701
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,400
why they had the claims process

702
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,000
um so on the other side of this right

703
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,959
i've talked about the barriers i've

704
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,720
talked about

705
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,919
the um i'm just gonna check on time

706
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,558
um i've talked about the

707
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,000
obstacles um so then it always came to

708
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:35,440
me that one of the first questions i

709
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,279
would ask great is well why are you

710
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,200
doing this this is so difficult right

711
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,519
anyone familiar with farming knows

712
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,679
that farming is you know economically

713
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,918
difficult it's hard labor

714
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,519
um right it's it's every odd is against

715
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,200
you even if you're us born even if

716
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,200
you're born into a farming family even

717
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,640
if you have capital and resources it's

718
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,240
just very difficult

719
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,559
and you look at people that are coming

720
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,798
here with very little money to invest

721
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:00,399
very little social networks very little

722
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,200
education and marketing or business

723
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,080
skills

724
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,200
and they're still doing it um and what i

725
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,119
really found this had

726
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,400
this had a lot to do with this sense of

727
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,879
reclaiming

728
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,759
their identity and as i was saying also

729
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,000
reclaiming their

730
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,960
their labor and that that having their

731
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,319
own farm

732
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,159
was very different than working on

733
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,439
someone else's farm

734
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,278
and so they talked to me a lot about

735
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,320
this sense of recreating

736
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,880
you know home recreating the sense of

737
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,599
life in mexico or life back home that

738
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,720
once they had

739
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,319
acknowledged that they were going to

740
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,880
stay here that they wanted to make their

741
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,558
life

742
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,679
you know what they were familiar with

743
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,558
and they wanted to teach it to their

744
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,320
children

745
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,759
and this was reflected as if i was

746
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,079
saying in the scale

747
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,158
so most farms were anywhere from four

748
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,158
acres to the biggest farm i think i saw

749
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,240
was about 60 acres

750
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,840
um and while they were not all certified

751
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,558
organic um

752
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,918
they used kind of low input low spray a

753
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:53,278
lot of them weren't certified simply

754
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,799
because of the paperwork and cost of

755
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,278
being certified

756
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,720
um and since the book came out i've

757
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,919
actually been working a little bit

758
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,159
with uh nofa the northeast farming is a

759
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,000
northeast organic farming association on

760
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,278
how to make all of their paperwork and

761
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
their application process more

762
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,000
accessible

763
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,440
to spanish-speaking immigrants um

764
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,240
because sometimes it's just that it's

765
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,919
not

766
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,599
it has not been apparent right that they

767
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,759
needed to have things in spanish if they

768
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,918
wanted to reach this audience

769
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,440
um and that it can't be like five clicks

770
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,200
to get to the spanish-speaking form

771
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,240
right it needs to be accessible from the

772
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,519
get-go

773
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,000
um so many of them like i said while

774
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,200
they were not

775
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,798
certified um they would fall under the

776
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,840
broad category of alternative

777
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,119
agriculture right

778
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:40,079
very diversified um you know

779
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,599
low inputs in terms of the scale of

780
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,000
agriculture in the us today

781
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,639
and small scale as well as direct

782
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,679
marketing

783
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,120
um and so while there were some

784
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,720
farmers in california that just

785
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,399
basically could not get into the markets

786
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,240
because they were so saturated

787
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,840
all of them preferred direct markets it

788
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,200
was more familiar to them it's how they

789
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,918
had grown up farming

790
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,600
so that everything from farmers markets

791
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,400
to sometimes selling directly to

792
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,759
mexican grocery stores to directly to

793
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,519
neighbors and people in their own

794
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,359
community

795
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,798
and for them again it was this sense of

796
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,000
controlling their day-to-day

797
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,639
their own labor um as well as preserving

798
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,278
their own

799
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,799
traditional food waste um and so even in

800
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,159
a place where say

801
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:21,918
they might have had to narrow it down to

802
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,200
three crops because that's what would

803
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,759
sell at market

804
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,480
um on the side they would have their own

805
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,240
you know

806
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,798
milpa or garden so corn beans and squash

807
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,159
or

808
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,158
more of a traditional diet that would

809
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,320
feed their family so no matter what

810
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,440
part of their field would be for their

811
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,839
family

812
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,759
um so it was about much more than a

813
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,959
business right it was about recreating

814
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,359
this sense of home

815
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,000
and familiarity with agriculture for

816
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,759
their family

817
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,119
so this is actually the one farmer that

818
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,599
i interviewed

819
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,119
in the ithaca area um who i've been able

820
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,678
to keep up with

821
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:00,399
and he said um you know it's part of our

822
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,880
heritage that we want to be able to

823
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,840
knock it up at a certain time but just

824
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,960
jump in a car and

825
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,119
not just jump in a car and leave your

826
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,319
house it's more a way of life being able

827
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,759
to raise your kids at home

828
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,000
because everywhere we're from has their

829
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,359
own farm every single person in town had

830
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,159
their own farm

831
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,558
um and you know for him and his wife it

832
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,480
was

833
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,240
very much about that family about

834
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,200
teaching their kids

835
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,319
how to farm and being part of a local

836
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,319
food system for

837
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:30,240
their family another farmer in virginia

838
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,158
who had a really beautiful

839
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,319
flower farm where she also had herbs and

840
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,600
vegetables for the market um

841
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,519
she said life in the united states is

842
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,199
very ugly people everyone stays in their

843
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,639
own house there's no time

844
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,720
people live by their watch and there's a

845
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,159
lot of stress and then

846
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,839
you know we were sitting in her living

847
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,360
room having coffee and we were looking

848
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,879
on her farm she's one of the farmers

849
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:52,398
that actually did own her land

850
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,919
um the land values in virginia

851
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,959
are very low when the farming community

852
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,520
that i was interviewing

853
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,399
started to settle there in the 80s and

854
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,158
she said

855
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,398
on her farm it's a little bit like

856
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,640
mexico it makes me feel the same

857
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,398
it's not the same exactly but more free

858
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,200
in the city there's more pressure

859
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,639
so for her it's not just about the the

860
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,840
practice of being a farmer it's about

861
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,880
the livelihood that she could create

862
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:19,359
there

863
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,120
um so this is another farmer in

864
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,038
california

865
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,558
and he was one of the farmers that was

866
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,798
really in the salinas valley

867
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,960
like strawberry growing region just

868
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:32,879
everywhere in strawberries

869
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,480
um and you know his farm really you

870
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,559
could see this very visual contrast

871
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,200
between this very diversified vegetable

872
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:39,440
farm and

873
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,038
the monocrop strawberries everywhere he

874
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,640
said i like the life of a farmer

875
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,398
i don't necessarily recommend it you

876
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,320
have to love agriculture you need to

877
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,839
love farming more than you love money

878
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,839
one of the first things is you have to

879
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,759
love this you can't do it for the money

880
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,359
that is part of farming right so why

881
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,798
does he continue

882
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:59,038
um to farm against these barriers

883
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,798
and there's another california farmer um

884
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,240
this was also in reference to kind of

885
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:03,679
the question of why don't you farm like

886
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,278
everyone around you and he said

887
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,440
they do it for the money and i do it for

888
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,119
the freedom which i think is a really

889
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,798
powerful statement in the context of

890
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,319
people that have immigrated to the us

891
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,798
that have been working on other people's

892
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:15,439
farms and then choose farming as their

893
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:17,679
way

894
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,080
um to find freedom on this side of the

895
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,080
border

896
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,159
so as i was speaking to um you know i

897
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,399
don't like to

898
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,000
um it was hard in writing the book to

899
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,239
figure out how to identify

900
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,240
the farmers right is it sustainable is

901
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,120
it small scale is it local right and i

902
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,759
really landed on

903
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,278
alternative as a broad way to describe

904
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,319
the farming i was seeing right which is

905
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:43,919
that it's relatively small scale

906
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:47,200
low input in terms of chemical

907
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,880
additives right but not strictly

908
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,960
very diverse and i think that was one of

909
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,640
the most defining features of every farm

910
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,519
that i went to

911
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,759
um direct marketing as well as

912
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,119
prioritizing family labor and of course

913
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:00,720
that doesn't

914
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,798
you know back to the question that i

915
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,640
brought up of um

916
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,558
labor justice right just because you

917
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,559
have your family working on the farm

918
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,678
doesn't mean that everything's equal and

919
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,960
great um and i did not go very much into

920
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,919
gender dynamics

921
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,278
given kind of the nature of my methods i

922
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,520
most farms

923
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,119
i visited one time i maybe got to know

924
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,480
them in a market and then i was invited

925
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,519
to their home

926
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,519
most of the time it was the male farmer

927
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,798
it was usually a male and female couple

928
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,200
with children

929
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,960
um and it was usually the male farmer

930
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,360
was the farmer even though i could

931
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,399
always

932
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,158
the the female part of the couple would

933
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:39,599
usually kind of be like adding in all

934
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,360
this information

935
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:45,599
um so clearly there were some gender um

936
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,959
dynamics going on there always are um

937
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,240
and i didn't really get to ask about

938
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,759
that just given that i was

939
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,480
meeting with most farming families just

940
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,000
one time so all that is to say just

941
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,278
because it's family labor doesn't mean

942
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
it's equal

943
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,798
or perfect but in this case i think it's

944
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,119
significant

945
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,440
in terms of agrarian transition because

946
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,518
the family labor was very intentional

947
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,200
and they did not want to scale up for

948
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,798
the most part i'd say would you want to

949
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,399
get bigger do you want to you know have

950
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:11,759
more property do you want to have more

951
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,518
employees do you want to grow more and

952
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,759
they mostly would say no i really don't

953
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,120
um you know i'm happy at this scale i

954
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,798
want to make this work

955
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,278
i don't want to be in a position of

956
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:22,960
hiring people like i was being hired

957
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,880
um because you know at the end of the

958
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,919
day they can't afford to pay workers any

959
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,080
more than they were paid

960
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,640
right they're still in the same place of

961
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,960
being stuck in terms of their income

962
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,679
and their ability to do more for their

963
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,519
workers

964
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,600
um and so while they would say to me oh

965
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,399
you know i was a worker so i understand

966
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,759
and this is

967
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,439
some of them did have some workers some

968
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,960
of them that have been around longer

969
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,798
um you know i always give them breaks i

970
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,319
give them gatorade um you know they

971
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,398
weren't essentially

972
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,678
very different employers than people

973
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:51,038
they had worked for except that they

974
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,919
could speak spanish and they might be

975
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:53,839
friends

976
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,000
um you know and i think that that just

977
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,839
goes to the structural constraints

978
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,359
of agriculture in the united states

979
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,199
today where farmers are not making

980
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,199
enough money

981
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,038
and not for the most part able to pay a

982
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,519
lot of money and these farmers were no

983
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:07,359
different

984
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,480
even though they might have wanted to

985
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,479
more than other farmers

986
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,558
so really this leads us to a lot of

987
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:17,199
questions of course says research always

988
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,398
does

989
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,399
um so immigrant farmers i think are

990
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,879
really important to pay attention to

991
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:27,599
because it's um an opportunity for us to

992
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,080
better understand the role of low

993
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:30,558
resource

994
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,839
farmers of farmers of color broadly and

995
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:33,278
how to make them part

996
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:34,959
not just of the food system but part of

997
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:35,759
the alternative food system which we

998
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,840
know

999
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:39,119
is a growing part of the food system and

1000
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,158
there's a desire

1001
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:45,359
for um you know more regional

1002
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,720
um more organic foods more local foods

1003
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:47,759
right i don't have to explain what that

1004
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,278
means

1005
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,558
um but while there's a real plate a role

1006
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:54,079
for them to fill

1007
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,158
um because they have all of this

1008
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,678
knowledge and skills

1009
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,278
they're under the same pressures that

1010
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,559
other farmers are right so what i did

1011
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,880
see was places where

1012
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,359
they'd say well the past i started out

1013
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,960
you know with 40 50 varieties but i had

1014
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,719
to really narrow it down because the

1015
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,159
market i'm selling in i can't sell at

1016
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,240
all so then i had to start just selling

1017
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,720
tomatoes to this one

1018
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,839
you know middle person cooler so the

1019
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,440
pressure to

1020
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,199
be less diverse in terms of what they

1021
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,798
grow was very much there especially in

1022
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,000
more competitive markets like the west

1023
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,240
coast

1024
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,679
um and of course if they're gonna make

1025
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,200
it oftentimes they felt they did have to

1026
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,519
scale up even when that's not what they

1027
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,720
wanted and to hire more non-family labor

1028
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,359
meaning hire people at very low cost

1029
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,159
um which of course then to this last

1030
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,639
point reproduces some of the class

1031
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,720
inequalities and the labor issues that

1032
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,960
all of agriculture struggles with

1033
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,038
and that i started in on this project

1034
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,519
wanting to find an answer or find some

1035
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:53,038
kind of solution and i think ultimately

1036
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,919
you know the issues are structural

1037
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,679
um so i do think that immigrant farmers

1038
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,799
play a very important role in our food

1039
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,200
system today

1040
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,720
a very underappreciated role um there

1041
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,038
are a lot of ways we could be reaching

1042
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,240
out

1043
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:08,878
much more so um and and

1044
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,838
making um especially regional food

1045
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:11,759
systems

1046
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,759
places where they are more easily able

1047
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,679
to be a part of growing and marketing

1048
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,200
and selling their crops

1049
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,039
and i think we have a lot to gain from

1050
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,000
that in terms of if we're interested in

1051
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,239
more ecological

1052
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,679
sustainability because i always like to

1053
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,000
point out that they're the farmers

1054
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,599
they know how to do this right they they

1055
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,440
don't know how to market themselves they

1056
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,200
don't know how to fill out the paperwork

1057
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,559
but they do know how to farm right this

1058
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,199
isn't something they need to learn and i

1059
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:34,559
think that's

1060
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,239
one of the things that new and beginning

1061
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:36,960
farmers are struggling with in the us

1062
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,638
today

1063
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,079
if you don't come from an agriculture

1064
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,919
background and what we

1065
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,519
what i see is that we have farms all

1066
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,559
over the us with

1067
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:48,398
sustainable farmers that don't have land

1068
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,440
so how do we make that transition i

1069
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:54,398
think is the question

1070
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,398
um so this is a quote from a farmer in

1071
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,719
washington state that i interviewed he

1072
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:02,159
was renting from a farm incubator called

1073
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:06,959
viva um and he

1074
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:10,159
was um so he was an indigenous immigrant

1075
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,280
very young still working his day job um

1076
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,480
in the berry fields

1077
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,160
in washington um and and really still

1078
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,079
just very passionate motivated to go out

1079
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,440
at the end of the day and do it again

1080
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,000
of course when i asked him why are you

1081
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,880
doing this he said if the sun comes out

1082
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,639
for everybody

1083
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,160
why have envy if it comes out for

1084
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,879
everyone it comes out for the blondes

1085
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,799
the latinos the japanese for everybody

1086
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,559
the sun does not discriminate the rain

1087
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,160
falls for every farmer

1088
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:35,838
so i think it's a really beautiful image

1089
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:39,920
of kind of hope in the midst

1090
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:41,358
of a lot of destruction and um

1091
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,880
challenges that our food system is

1092
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,799
experiencing right now

1093
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,800
um so of course i have my

1094
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,599
acknowledgements my research assistants

1095
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,119
and funding

1096
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:56,160
and um and so forth but um

1097
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,200
yeah i'll stop there and hopefully i

1098
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,719
didn't go

1099
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:03,838
too long i'm happy to answer

1100
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,838
questions that people have

1101
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,759
oh don i think you're muted now

1102
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,919
sorry i think we've all been prayed to

1103
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,199
that uh

1104
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,920
fault in the zoom age so questions for

1105
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:19,919
laura ann

1106
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,079
and actually i'll lead with one uh which

1107
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,760
is

1108
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:33,119
did you find that generally these

1109
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,160
latino latina farm families

1110
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,519
wanted their kids to

1111
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:41,358
uh perpetuate the farms

1112
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,280
yeah it's a really good question and

1113
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:46,880
it's one that i did always ask

1114
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,240
um and i found a mix mix of responses um

1115
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,079
they felt strongly that they wanted

1116
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,719
their children to learn they wanted to

1117
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,440
offer

1118
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,078
this as an option and you know one

1119
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
farmer

1120
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,680
specifically said to me well this is

1121
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,079
always a backup plan you can always fall

1122
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,440
back

1123
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,960
you know how to grow your own food and

1124
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,400
that's a life skill that my kids should

1125
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,800
know because i know it

1126
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,240
um but a lot of them just like most

1127
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,640
parents were like well i really want my

1128
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:09,279
kids to go to college and i want my kids

1129
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,239
to have

1130
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,440
options and opportunities um so no one

1131
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:14,879
was strictly saying

1132
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,000
you know my children should take over

1133
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,358
the farm i don't think there was any

1134
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,039
pressure there i think they came to the

1135
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,719
united states to give their children

1136
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,480
other opportunities

1137
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,078
that they didn't have and so i think a

1138
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,519
lot of them felt hey if i can make a

1139
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,519
successful business that my children

1140
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,719
want to take over that's great and i did

1141
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,599
actually see some of that

1142
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:33,519
and in some of the most successful farms

1143
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,720
they already had kind of college-age

1144
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:36,079
children that have been through the

1145
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,598
education system

1146
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,039
you know in the u.s spoke perfect

1147
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,640
english and decided to help with the

1148
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,639
farm and they were the ones that managed

1149
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,319
all the marketing and the markets and

1150
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,400
that was really helpful for those

1151
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,599
families um but then i had

1152
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,200
talked to a lot of farmers that were

1153
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,359
like oh i have a daughter she's learning

1154
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,239
to be a dental hygienist and i'm so

1155
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:53,838
proud of that

1156
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,399
and yeah she wants to be part of the

1157
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,599
farm great but it's not required so i

1158
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,760
think there was a real mix

1159
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,559
like any parent you know you want your

1160
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,560
kids options

1161
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:05,838
other questions

1162
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,598
yeah i was kind of pursuing that one in

1163
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:12,719
a little bit different direction too

1164
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,880
that

1165
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,000
it seems like really for cultural values

1166
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,838
they're getting into a part of the

1167
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,320
market that's almost impossible to make

1168
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:23,599
a living at

1169
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,200
and so that seems like it it's even more

1170
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,079
challenging to get the farm kids to stay

1171
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,078
on the farm that way

1172
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:34,159
but so looking at the sort of our

1173
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,519
end in the agricultural education

1174
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:40,480
business as it were

1175
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:43,759
um did you see any cases where

1176
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,440
people did like the farming aspects of

1177
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,200
its children

1178
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,800
and had the potential to go to college

1179
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,000
but they were interested in going to

1180
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,760
agriculture rather

1181
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,838
than into dental hygiene or something

1182
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,599
that's sort of more

1183
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,599
obvious ways to find a job

1184
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,720
if you saw that what was driving that

1185
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:06,319
i did see that a little bit um i can't

1186
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,598
say there were a lot of cases

1187
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,800
i can think of one in virginia

1188
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,640
um you know and i think a lot of

1189
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,720
i think i could speak to more to why i

1190
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,559
think i didn't see it is i'm not sure

1191
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,199
that they know that that exists as an

1192
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,599
option um because again again i think

1193
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,559
they're

1194
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,800
they're really socially isolated um and

1195
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,320
so in in terms of kind of like what your

1196
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,079
options might be after high school i'm

1197
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,680
not sure a lot of them were

1198
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,839
hearing and i could be wrong because i

1199
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,519
didn't ask that question specifically

1200
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,960
um but i didn't hear a lot of people

1201
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,358
talking about you know if i'm going to

1202
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,480
stay

1203
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:40,400
if i'm going to go to school i'm going

1204
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,920
to really study agriculture

1205
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,400
because i because their parents are not

1206
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,920
networked in um with the same types of

1207
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,280
resources that our farmers are they're

1208
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,720
not you know when i would ask in the

1209
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,880
usda office

1210
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,480
um you know how do you reach out they'd

1211
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,160
be like oh well we have our lists

1212
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,519
and if someone comes to our office they

1213
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:56,799
get on our list and it's like well if

1214
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,639
people never come to your office they're

1215
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,400
never going to get on your list

1216
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,159
so i don't think their kids at the same

1217
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,920
time were kind of in the know

1218
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:07,279
of what ag schools have to offer

1219
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,280
you know i'd say that's that's my

1220
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,480
assumption because i really didn't hear

1221
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,000
about it if they were going to go to

1222
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,119
college they were getting away from the

1223
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,079
farm

1224
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,079
and if they were going to stay on the

1225
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,839
farm they were just excited to stay on

1226
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,240
the farm and help their parents with

1227
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,679
so many needs you know it could be

1228
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,000
english they could do so much to help

1229
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:27,279
their family just by staying

1230
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,519
no thanks for that laura ann if you look

1231
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,720
in chat you'll see that there are a

1232
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,759
couple of questions

1233
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,439
there yeah so i see the one about

1234
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,440
um the hmong community so do you think

1235
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,079
the attitudes might exist

1236
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,599
among other communities traditionally

1237
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,280
farming such as the hmong

1238
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,720
so interestingly i actually started my

1239
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,920
dissertation work thinking i was going

1240
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,199
to work with the hmong in california

1241
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,920
specifically because i had some

1242
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,199
connections with extension in stockton

1243
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,920
and i think there are so many

1244
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,919
similarities with these stories um

1245
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,519
i realized quickly that i didn't learn i

1246
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,880
didn't speak long and i spoke spanish

1247
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:02,880
and i really needed to

1248
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,079
not spend three years learning a new

1249
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,480
language

1250
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,119
um but i did do some interviews in

1251
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,960
stockton

1252
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,720
just in the start of this work and i

1253
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,720
think um

1254
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,559
there are a lot of overlaps the biggest

1255
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,959
difference is that the hmong community

1256
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,960
comes

1257
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,960
in as refugees um and the

1258
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,240
farmworker communities are coming in as

1259
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,800
undocumented or

1260
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,318
maybe documented immigrants so the

1261
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,519
refugee communities

1262
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:30,159
and i'm doing some work actually with

1263
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,159
refugees in syracuse right now

1264
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,399
refugee communities by no means do they

1265
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,239
have lots of resources but they have a

1266
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,119
different set of resources than other

1267
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:42,159
immigrants and because there are so many

1268
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,318
um the the rap program the

1269
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,279
office of refugee resettlement has an

1270
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:48,000
agricultural

1271
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,359
funding stream for refugee farmers and

1272
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,239
the hmong farmers have been really

1273
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,799
successful

1274
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,559
um in in taking advantage of those

1275
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,240
resources which is great

1276
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,920
um so i think a lot of their their

1277
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,439
narratives and their histories are the

1278
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,200
same in terms of why they're farming why

1279
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,079
they want to teach their kids to farm

1280
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:06,000
and in minnesota i actually saw latino

1281
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,680
farmers and hmong farmers using the same

1282
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,519
food hub and there was a relationship

1283
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:10,719
there

1284
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,559
but i think there's something really

1285
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:13,838
different in the refugee groups that

1286
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:15,440
come in and they don't work in

1287
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:17,199
agriculture in the us

1288
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,039
but then they get back into farming

1289
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:20,239
because similar to other immigrants

1290
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,440
that's what they know

1291
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,358
so then it's really different for the

1292
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,800
latino groups that are coming in

1293
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,039
working in industrial agriculture as

1294
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,720
their jobs and then getting into it

1295
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,358
without any of the networks that the

1296
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:32,959
refugees have so not to say like

1297
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,559
one group is better off than the other

1298
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,880
because it's not easy to be in either

1299
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,960
group

1300
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,480
obviously to start a farm but i think

1301
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,920
they have somewhat different paths to

1302
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,760
agriculture

1303
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,920
and different sets of resources and

1304
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,880
networks so the hmong are just more

1305
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,318
networked in

1306
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,240
um than farmworkers are

1307
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,400
um but yeah it's a really good question

1308
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:58,799
there's a lot of commonalities there

1309
00:42:52,400 --> 00:43:02,000
did that answer i don't know i can't see

1310
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,800
um what options

1311
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,119
on how digital agriculture what are your

1312
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,480
oh

1313
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,480
opinions sorry on how digital

1314
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,760
agriculture would influence immigrant

1315
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,000
farmers

1316
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,520
and what could we do from technology

1317
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,039
aspect to help them

1318
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:18,960
um so in terms of digital agriculture

1319
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,639
i might just ask what with digital

1320
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,960
agriculture do you mean

1321
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,879
um like the ways people are using cell

1322
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,159
phones to track the markets

1323
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:31,680
or other

1324
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:34,639
maybe help me with the question

1325
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:36,480
yeah laura this is you uh so in terms of

1326
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:39,679
the digital agriculture is just

1327
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,838
a new revolution of technology

1328
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,480
dedicated for agriculture applications

1329
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:47,279
so you know for example instead of using

1330
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,760
uh heavy-duty agriculture machinery we

1331
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,440
probably will use robots

1332
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,599
and you know just such different you

1333
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,880
know technologies

1334
00:43:53,599 --> 00:44:00,000
that can reduce you know the pesticide

1335
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,160
applications stuff like that so i'm just

1336
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,519
wondering overall how those technologies

1337
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,879
would influence

1338
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:09,519
immigrant farmers and how we could do

1339
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,960
from the technology aspect to help them

1340
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:14,000
if possible

1341
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,318
yeah it's a good question um i hadn't so

1342
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,760
one thing i saw

1343
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:19,679
was well obviously everyone has cell

1344
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,680
phones um and so

1345
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,039
but they don't have a lot of access so

1346
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:24,078
they have cell phones they don't have

1347
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,119
access to capital

1348
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:30,400
um to invest in technology right so

1349
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:33,039
anything that increases the investment

1350
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,079
the the edge in terms of investment

1351
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:35,519
usually they would

1352
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,519
it would they would fall behind unless

1353
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,960
someone is like gifting them lots of

1354
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,318
money and technology um you know i did

1355
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,159
see that there were really simple

1356
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:47,358
technologies that could be helpful

1357
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,639
um in terms of um

1358
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:50,159
you know apps to help them with

1359
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:51,759
marketing you know i actually heard some

1360
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:54,399
creative ideas from them

1361
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,319
um you know not necessarily specific

1362
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,400
agricultural technologies but the ways

1363
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,000
that they could be using their phones

1364
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,760
um for things like really simple

1365
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,239
marketing translation

1366
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,440
um you know the more that that they

1367
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,959
could

1368
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,480
be kind of getting a leg up because for

1369
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,800
them they're really trying to catch up

1370
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,079
with the technology that already exists

1371
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,200
because they don't have the money to

1372
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,720
invest um and in terms of like robotics

1373
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,559
versus labor

1374
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,480
again i think it largely puts them at a

1375
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,880
disadvantage because what they have

1376
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,400
is labor right i mean that's what they

1377
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,920
have to offer they have their family

1378
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,318
they have themselves

1379
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,920
they are the workers um and that's what

1380
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:31,199
they have that other farmers don't have

1381
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,000
is that they don't have to hire the

1382
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,439
labor

1383
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,519
so i think in a lot of ways technology

1384
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,200
you know unless they have the money to

1385
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,400
invest in the technology themselves

1386
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,559
which they don't

1387
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,920
it's hard to imagine how technology can

1388
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:45,920
help them

1389
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,280
unless it's specifically technology that

1390
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,159
helps them with these barriers that

1391
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,760
they're already

1392
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:55,199
struggling with you know so

1393
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,079
um let's see so as far as other

1394
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:00,159
questions

1395
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:02,160
i can just go back to the chat um

1396
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:03,598
speak to let's see if i can see if who's

1397
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,039
still here it looks like okay so

1398
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,480
elizabeth is still here

1399
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,239
can you speak to some of the differences

1400
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,679
you noticed among your respondents do

1401
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:10,318
you notice that region gender years in

1402
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:12,960
the us

1403
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,039
shape experiences of becoming farm

1404
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,000
operators um

1405
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,400
yeah definitely um you know the longer

1406
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,480
that

1407
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,680
they had been in the u.s and they'd say

1408
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,159
the longer that their

1409
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:25,598
community had been established in the us

1410
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,519
um

1411
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,079
you know the the more established that

1412
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,280
they were as farmers right the easier

1413
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,480
time that they had

1414
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,480
um and so i think that was really

1415
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,039
different regionally um

1416
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,358
so at the community that i worked with

1417
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:41,199
in the northern neck of virginia

1418
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,519
um it was a group of farmers that had

1419
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,759
come in in the 1980s many of them had

1420
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:48,960
been through

1421
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,599
the legislation where they got um

1422
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,318
you know legal status in the 80s they

1423
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,640
just had

1424
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,239
these really established small-scale

1425
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:59,118
farms they'd come in with the

1426
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:01,598
berry migrants and and they had already

1427
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:05,039
kind of multiple generations they really

1428
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,079
um they had more a sense of the market

1429
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:08,318
and what they were doing

1430
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,318
um and they also owned land because it's

1431
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:11,679
just inexpensive to own land in certain

1432
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:13,358
parts of virginia

1433
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,440
that varied a lot with what i was seeing

1434
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,199
in california so in california even

1435
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,358
though there are many generations

1436
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,799
of you know mexican and latino

1437
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:24,000
immigrants

1438
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,000
um i saw that there were

1439
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,358
the the immigrant farmers there were

1440
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,838
largely um

1441
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:31,920
indigenous um from mexico they were

1442
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:34,159
newer immigrants they were younger

1443
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,200
um in california it's just so hard to

1444
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:36,799
own land even

1445
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,480
really established farmers don't own

1446
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,240
land they rent land you have the whole

1447
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,400
issue of water access

1448
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:44,318
um so they were just in a very different

1449
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,318
situation regionally in terms of

1450
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:49,039
saturation of markets and access to

1451
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:51,759
markets and access to resources

1452
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:53,279
and they were a newer set of farmers um

1453
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,119
so it really and that's just kind of

1454
00:47:53,280 --> 00:48:00,640
two examples that really contrasted um

1455
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,318
but you know it really did depend

1456
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:04,000
and then at the same time i saw a lot of

1457
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,000
commonalities a lot of them

1458
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,079
they were still had the same goals for

1459
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,519
their farms in terms of keeping it small

1460
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:14,079
and diverse and direct markets um

1461
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,679
so i don't know if that answers i mean

1462
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,240
there's a lot of other kind of factors

1463
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:21,279
there

1464
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:24,799
but it's a region definitely did matter

1465
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,040
um see

1466
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,480
i think the next question oh um from

1467
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,400
richard uh

1468
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,679
how many there are many examples latino

1469
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,280
farmers

1470
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:35,679
working their way into partnerships or

1471
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,839
transitions with ongoing or retiring

1472
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,598
american farmers the same

1473
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:40,960
who are their current or former

1474
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,039
employers did you see this as a

1475
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,760
potentially large scale pathway to farm

1476
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,239
ownership

1477
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,920
or immigrant farmers within ambition

1478
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:49,598
yeah i mean actually thanks for asking

1479
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,800
because i didn't really discuss that but

1480
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,920
i do think that

1481
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,760
is the ideal situation is

1482
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,680
it didn't see it happening very much

1483
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,599
although there are some organizations

1484
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,919
working on that obviously

1485
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,079
um like farmland um and some of the

1486
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,119
incubator farms are trying to

1487
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:10,400
um be that middle path

1488
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,920
um you know what i saw was more that

1489
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,280
farmers were retiring and

1490
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,318
and selling to developers or selling to

1491
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,160
larger farmers simply because the farm

1492
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:20,639
workers couldn't afford to purchase the

1493
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:23,358
farm

1494
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,759
um so it had to be a really in the few

1495
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:26,078
place

1496
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,599
situations where i saw it happening it

1497
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,000
had to be a real mission

1498
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,440
of the current operator you know i

1499
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,239
really want to pass this on to my

1500
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,240
employees

1501
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:36,558
i really see that i'll take a hit here

1502
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:39,358
economically but it's worth it for me

1503
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,359
um so i guess i i think that that would

1504
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,759
be ideal to see that happening

1505
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:44,799
um but it's unfortunately i think the

1506
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,960
farmers

1507
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,559
in a lot of cases have to be willing to

1508
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,318
make less money on the property and of

1509
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,720
course it's not like farmers

1510
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,318
have a ton of money that they're making

1511
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:55,759
at this point so it's a i think it's a

1512
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:58,159
hard one unless there was some kind of

1513
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,599
subsidy for that transaction

1514
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:01,358
which you know that could happen and

1515
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,800
that would be great

1516
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:07,920
i'm sorry did that answer

1517
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,640
yes thank you yeah um yeah i know we're

1518
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,119
going to meet

1519
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:14,879
later today right more um

1520
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,960
i think that was all the questions i see

1521
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,039
on here hi laura

1522
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,559
and i have a question thank you so much

1523
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:22,960
for this talk uh

1524
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,680
i actually got the opportunity to

1525
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,720
interview

1526
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:28,159
a local organic farmer in pennsylvania

1527
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,399
because i'm working on this podcast

1528
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:34,000
project and she had brought up

1529
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:37,119
this article by chris newman

1530
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,159
who writes about indigenous food ways

1531
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:43,358
in north america and talked a little bit

1532
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:46,399
about how the industrial farm complex

1533
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:48,159
uh the way that we have thousands of

1534
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,358
acres that are in production for

1535
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:51,358
commodity crops

1536
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:53,279
which is very different from what these

1537
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:56,400
small diversified farms are

1538
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,040
is a way of almost holding the land

1539
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,760
uh that has been stolen from the

1540
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:02,960
indigenous

1541
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,800
uh farmers that had

1542
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,480
farmed it for generations so i was

1543
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,359
wondering if in your research you would

1544
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,480
come across

1545
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:12,239
anything like that and any ways that our

1546
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,519
farm system could become more

1547
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,000
sustainable

1548
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:17,199
uh with these smaller diversified farms

1549
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,519
or if really

1550
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,118
uh because in the middle of the country

1551
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,599
the land is a lot cheaper

1552
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,880
but the fear is that as these older

1553
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,559
farmers age out

1554
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,079
the larger corporations are going to end

1555
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,200
up just buying it and

1556
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,559
consolidating even more land right i

1557
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,279
mean and that is what we've seen

1558
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:37,599
happening is this consolidation

1559
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,480
of the land especially in the midwest um

1560
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,480
so

1561
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,079
i mean i guess is the question then do

1562
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,920
we see anything

1563
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,680
other than that happening like is there

1564
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,720
a pattern

1565
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:51,759
that's going against that yeah i would i

1566
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:55,358
want to see some kind of positivity

1567
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,160
i mean i i'd say yes i think in pockets

1568
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:59,279
and i think what i

1569
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:01,118
what is hopeful to me about my study

1570
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,319
is that i do not think that these

1571
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,760
farmers have been

1572
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:07,679
captured in terms of studies

1573
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,200
before so something i didn't talk about

1574
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,799
is the ways that the usda doesn't

1575
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:12,719
capture these farmers and so i think the

1576
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,318
numbers are actually much higher

1577
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:16,480
so most the farmers that i spoke with

1578
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:17,119
are really off the grid in terms of you

1579
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,719
know they

1580
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,079
usually rent from someone else and the

1581
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,279
person they're renting from is the one

1582
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,200
that fills out the census

1583
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,040
um and they may or may not be reporting

1584
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:26,558
that this farmer is just renting

1585
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:28,800
a few acres here and there because it's

1586
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,240
so informal for many of them not

1587
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,200
everyone but a lot of it was very

1588
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:34,239
informal

1589
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:35,598
and you know i'm hopeful all right i

1590
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:37,439
definitely believe it's happening all

1591
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,599
over the country um

1592
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,559
you know i think as far as the kind of

1593
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,920
resistance

1594
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:46,720
to our current um

1595
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,000
you know food system on a large scale i

1596
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,679
do think we're going to have to create

1597
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,440
more structural support for farmers like

1598
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:54,078
this because they're struggling

1599
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,639
um you know and and it's happening but

1600
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,480
it's

1601
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,639
it's happening against these odds and so

1602
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,599
i think for us to have large-scale

1603
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:03,279
transfer of land um there has to be some

1604
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,079
kind of structural solution too it can't

1605
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,839
just be

1606
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,680
ad hoc how it's happening now and i

1607
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:09,759
think the social movements that we see

1608
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:11,679
in you know agricultural social

1609
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,920
movements and

1610
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:17,919
um you know immigration movements like

1611
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,519
support that i think there's a large

1612
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,358
social movement among beginning and new

1613
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:24,318
farmers that wants to see

1614
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:25,519
these you know um long-term inequalities

1615
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:29,358
addressed

1616
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:30,000
um you know from colonization to slavery

1617
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:33,759
to

1618
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,119
you know immigrants today um but i think

1619
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,119
it's going to take a lot of political

1620
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,640
will to make a really big structural

1621
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,079
difference right it doesn't mean we

1622
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:42,480
shouldn't continue to support the

1623
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,318
movements doing the work but it's

1624
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,480
you know i mean there's a push right now

1625
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:48,800
i i just saw an article this morning

1626
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,240
to get the biden administration you know

1627
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,240
to actually support

1628
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:53,679
african-american farmers right and so i

1629
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:55,199
think there's a lot more talk about

1630
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:56,558
these things right now and i think

1631
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:58,480
political

1632
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,800
there's a lot more talk and pressure and

1633
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,880
that helps create the political will

1634
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:07,440
so i'm hopeful today more so than i was

1635
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,960
a few months ago about it

1636
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,318
yeah thank you so much that was an

1637
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,318
awesome answer thanks

1638
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,160
any other anybody else

1639
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,319
just wanted to say thank you i had a

1640
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:21,199
chance to ask lori on a few questions

1641
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:23,119
this morning

1642
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:24,719
so i didn't want to steal any more air

1643
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,000
time but i really appreciate your time

1644
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,759

thanks thank you for coming twice

1646
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,440
yeah and you and i have some time later

1647
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,559
so okay great

1648
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:40,159
oh my god i'm looking forward to it hi

1649
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:42,079
i have uh i have one more question yeah

1650
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,679
well this was an awesome talk this is

1651
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,160
like the first uh

1652
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:47,118
seminar i actually attended the semester

1653
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,759
um

1654
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,000
and uh i was just wondering like what

1655
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,960
made you want to do your research on

1656
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,838
um you know new immigrant farmers like

1657
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,838
like what was

1658
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,838
uh i guess the reason behind that i

1659
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:03,358
don't know the drive

1660
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:05,440
um yeah the so it

1661
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:07,119
it started actually when i was an

1662
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,159
undergraduate at cornell

1663
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,680
i went and did some work in guatemala

1664
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:14,239
i was looking at permaculture and

1665
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:17,279
indigenous farming systems there

1666
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:18,719
um and then when i i was really

1667
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,359
interested in kind of traditional

1668
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:21,118
farming

1669
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:22,400
and sustainable food systems and then

1670
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,400
when i came back to the us

1671
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,318
i thought okay i really want to go work

1672
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,720
on a farm and try farming

1673
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:29,358
and i moved out to california to work on

1674
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:31,519
farms

1675
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:32,639
oh and i did some in new york and then i

1676
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:34,719
was california

1677
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:36,400
and what i really found is rather than

1678
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:40,078
wanting to be a farmer myself

1679
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,920
because i recognized how hard it was um

1680
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,240
is i was really fascinated in the

1681
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,240
connection between the guatemalan

1682
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,919
farmers the mayan farmers and all the

1683
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:48,239
farm workers on the farm that i worked

1684
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,480
with

1685
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:51,919
in california and that they were really

1686
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,240
like you know they were

1687
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,200
all essentially indigenous to central

1688
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:57,838
america

1689
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:59,679
and mexico that they were all farmers

1690
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:01,838
right but that this one group was

1691
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:03,519
you know farming in guatemala this other

1692
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:04,318
group had immigrated to the us to work

1693
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:06,559
on like a big

1694
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:08,318
and you know organic farm in california

1695
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,680
but they really had the same background

1696
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:11,759
they talked about agriculture in the

1697
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:13,838
same ways so for me i was really

1698
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,880
interested in that connection between

1699
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:18,159
you know small scale in latin america

1700
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,079
and then

1701
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:21,519
um farm workers in the u.s and how do we

1702
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,519
highlight all the knowledge that

1703
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:25,440
farmworkers come to the us with so

1704
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:26,798
rather than just seeing them as workers

1705
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,318
how do we see them as people with

1706
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:28,880
knowledge that contribute to the food

1707
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,400
system

1708
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,160
so that was kind of how i got started on

1709
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,519
the the path

1710
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:39,519
to this project cool thank you

1711
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:42,480
i really enjoyed it um i just uh

1712
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:44,719

1713
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,838

1714
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:48,719

1715

and uh my grandma was a farmer then but

1716
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:52,798
you know the civil war started there and

1717
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,359
we're in new york city and it's just

1718
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:57,039
like now i'm i'm like a new transfer

1719

student at cornell studying like plants

1720
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,279
and agriculture and

1721
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:01,279
because it's something i'm really

1722
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,960
interested in and i don't know i think

1723
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,720
it's really cool that there's like

1724
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,960
like there's just so many different ways

1725
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:09,439
things could have gone um

1726
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,880
and i don't know i just i think

1727
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,318
immigration is

1728
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,720
in farming is really important they're

1729
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:16,558
really like the population that's doing

1730
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:18,159
most of the farming here in the u.s now

1731
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,720
people don't really want to farm anymore

1732
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:20,558
but

1733
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,078
it's like this is the backbone of our

1734
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,040
country like this is what we eat and

1735
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,480
stuff and

1736
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,480
