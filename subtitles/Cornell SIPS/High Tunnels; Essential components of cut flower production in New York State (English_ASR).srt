1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,770
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,769
University

3
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:12,359
actually I should go back a little

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:16,230
further as you'll soon hear while I'm

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:20,729
talking that we Alan and I pronounce

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,829
about the same way which gives an

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,179
indication that I'm also connected it's

8
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:29,639
moved south not as far south as he but I

9
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:32,579
went through the university of guelph on

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,759
my undergraduate then came South here to

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:39,839
Cornell for masters in PhD and

12
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,699
eventually came back 1979 to join the

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,359
faculty here so no stuck around ever

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:49,829
since but it's a fun journey and I'm

15
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:53,100
gonna be pulling up stakes at the end of

16
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,890
September so it's been fun being part of

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,280
this but today I want to share with you

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,239
my latest love and that is high tunnels

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,760
cut flowers and things along those lines

20
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:08,310
so if all these gadgets work the topics

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,609
I want to cover and I'll hit the first

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,618
ones in fairly rapid order is what's

23
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:16,739
what our high tunnels I know our

24
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:19,530
audience is diverse so we need to go

25
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,478
into little detail there then focus in

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,900
on New York State what our high tunnels

27
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:27,650
used for here in the state then we'll

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,540
switch over to cut flowers again

29
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,790
assuming that some of you may not be all

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,469
that informed about that topic

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,840
you heard the about world wide cut

32
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:43,200
flowers are not necessarily coming from

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,659
our local areas but then within us and

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,579
again locally New York we want to know

35
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,329
about that and then we'll combine the

36
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:54,798
two major topics into high tunnels and

37
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:58,139
cut flowers and how we might use those

38
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,530
structures together first of all we need

39
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,319
a definition and this is a fairly loose

40
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,039
one it's an unheated plastic covered

41
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:13,469
greenhouse can be made out of metal or

42
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:16,439
most likely is or sometimes wood etc the

43
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:18,689
heat is provided by the Sun so those of

44
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,990
you in sunny locations will have a

45
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:22,229
better

46
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,450
time with these structures and those are

47
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:28,849
not and you do need to provide water

48
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:28,849
since these plastic sheds the water off

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:38,400
the US and New York State are quite slow

50
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:41,969
in taking on this technology it probably

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,900
started originally when plastic film was

52
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:48,750
discovered in the 1960s or so the asians

53
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,930
have taken this to a tremendous degree

54
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:55,680
as you can see from the acreages

55
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:59,099
involved 2.5 million acres those of you

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,050
that have traveled to China recently you

57
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,689
travel through the countryside on their

58
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,240
super roads and you look out the side

59
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:09,449
window and you see these valleys you

60
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,340
can't see soil it's all just plastic

61
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:13,889
after plastic after plastic and it's

62
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,039
mostly tunnels that might be as high as

63
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:22,259
as two feet or so this is a picture I

64
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:25,199
think that bill Miller's yeah but that's

65
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:27,179
you know the whole valley the whole

66
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,549
valley is covered with plastic and

67
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,000
they're growing vegetables primarily in

68
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:36,000
there they've also innovated they're

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,360
using the Sun as a heat storage device

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,020
or using the structure as a heat storage

71
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,650
device and these special tunnels in the

72
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:51,120
middle picture there are I have a north

73
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:53,610
wall that is made out of brick or earth

74
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,259
or something like that and the Sun comes

75
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,890
up and beams in there

76
00:03:55,259 --> 00:04:01,500
warms that up in that night it radiates

77
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:04,709
the heat back so you don't need to heat

78
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,689
to place it but you do need sunny winter

79
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:09,180
conditions which in New York State is a

80
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:12,359
bit of a challenge of course so it might

81
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,890
not work here or if you fly over the

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:21,120
Mediterranean southern Spain Italy

83
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:24,319
Turkey Greece North Africa into Egypt

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,209
Tunisia etc all along the Mediterranean

85
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,189
there's tunnels all over the place and

86
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:30,879
this is al meriya Spain the picture on

87
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:33,550
the right it's

88
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,100
the plastic is covering everything so

89
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,720
tunnels were attacked and tunnels in

90
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,710
other countries are much more popular

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,940
and much more pervasive than here

92
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:45,189
350,000 acres in the Mediterranean

93
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:49,689
that's a lot of plastic that's a lot of

94
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:52,719
area covered okay so let's come closer

95
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:55,329
to home I'm sorry I didn't put in

96
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,520
pictures of gigantic tunnels and multi

97
00:04:55,329 --> 00:05:01,209
structures and so on but just to give

98
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:03,359
you an idea that we've got quite a few

99
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:07,180
of these structures around these days

100
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,280
it's estimated between 500 and 600 farms

101
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,590
here in New York State have some kind of

102
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:15,279
protective structures most of which

103
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:18,310
would be high tunnels of various sizes

104
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:21,369
and shapes so they are becoming much

105
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:25,209
more popular here as well so why are

106
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:29,439
they becoming popular here well part of

107
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:33,729
it is a cost factor as you can see in

108
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:38,439
the table for a 30 by 96 foot structure

109
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:41,560
a high tunnel will cost you about 3 $3

110
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:44,139
in the corridor per square foot if you

111
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,350
move it it's costs more if you don't

112
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:49,329
want to be growing in the soil there you

113
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,850
want to move it to another place then

114
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:55,060
it's it has to be more rigid you need

115
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,890
the rails etc so it costs more by the

116
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,649
time you get to greenhouses we're up at

117
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:03,159
five six seven eight dollars per square

118
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:07,719
foot so it's a cheap alternative to grow

119
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:11,170
stuff in these in this information I got

120
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,020
from the remote catalog the other major

121
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,750
factors but given a big boost to high

122
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:21,579
tunnels and high tunnel production is

123
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:24,040
the USDA the NRCS has had for years and

124
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:27,899
it's still continuing in each of the

125
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:31,000
states a program by which they will

126
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:33,669
financial give financial aid for

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,819
construction of a new tunnel and if you

128
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:40,300
don't want a 30 by 72 foot one you can

129
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:42,668
get a 30 by 96 or larger size but they

130
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,000
will only pay for this that portion of

131
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:46,669
it but

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,350
it's been a quite handy boost for people

133
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,330
who are kind of on defense and say yeah

134
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,390
we could really use one but I can't

135
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:56,479
afford it well here's the way you can so

136
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:58,879
NRCS offices around the state can help

137
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,960
you with the applications for that and

138
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,670
so what is as I've already mentioned

139
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:07,399
we've we've had quite an increase in

140
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:10,460
high tunnels in New York State with at

141
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:13,579
this point and it's about a six million

142
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:17,299
dollar production value being grown in

143
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:19,550
these structures so what sorts of things

144
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,939
are being growing well we've heard about

145
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:27,590
Tomatoes earlier today and that's the

146
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:30,490
new the huge number one crop that is

147
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:33,859
very well adapted to tomato production

148
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,660
and it's if you're familiar with tomato

149
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,250
production and greenhouses the

150
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,580
production in high tunnels is quite

151
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:44,360
similar it gives the advantage just

152
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:47,949
having that Sun assist of having a

153
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:51,610
growing season that with a harvest from

154
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:54,560
mid late June all the way into October

155
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,870
is high quality because the rain is kept

156
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,870
off all these nasty diseases at Martin

157
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,329
Marjory mentioned are not altogether

158
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,399
gone but certainly much less problem

159
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:06,589
because you've got a dry environment in

160
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,319
there and you're applying water not to

161
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:13,099
the foliage but just to the ground okay

162
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,829
and you know 15 pounds per plant are you

163
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,390
pretty good and a lot of people have

164
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:20,209
figured that out and a lot of people are

165
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:22,310
doing it and you talk to growers and say

166
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:25,219
yeah I'd never produce a tomato outside

167
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:28,490
anymore I can get five times as much

168
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:32,599
yield from from the high tunnel Tomatoes

169
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:34,430
okay so that's that's such a popular

170
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,339
crop that once you have a high tunnel

171
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:39,408
and say why would I grow anything else

172
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:41,659
it makes me so much money but then you

173
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:45,019
get into Marjorie's problems again say

174
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:47,899
well ok botrytis is coming in this

175
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:50,088
disease that disease insects that have

176
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,088
gotten adapted to that situation and so

177
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:55,070
we've got problems of succession

178
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:56,180
you really should be growing something

179
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,560
else in

180
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:03,699
space to break up the problems that are

181
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:08,539
going to happen one way you can do that

182
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:11,690
is put in greens that can even go over

183
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:13,149
winter and be harvested in an early

184
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,850
spring

185
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:19,450
some of these salad greens are quite

186
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:23,000
cold hardy you can freeze them stiff and

187
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:25,820
next they'll come back out of it and can

188
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,190
be harvested in they're delicious but

189
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,589
not too many people know about coma

190
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,830
Touma and so I mean so many things how

191
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:37,220
and so there is a bit of it there is a

192
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:40,850
bit of a consumer education project that

193
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:45,639
someone needs to undertake to take more

194
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,639
advantage of these very productive crops

195
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:53,360
cucumbers colored peppers they're all

196
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:55,159
good but economically more questionable

197
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,550
they aren't as productive as tomato

198
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:02,870
right you can produce a good quality

199
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:04,639
crop but so in terms of selecting

200
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,528
vegetables for this high tunnel

201
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,230
environment there are some principles

202
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:13,909
you need to follow well first of all

203
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:17,120
what can you sell then you need some if

204
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:19,458
you're going to use the fall through

205
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,759
spring season you need crops that are

206
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:25,099
adapted to that and in hot watt weather

207
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:27,679
ok tomatoes do pretty well as long as

208
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:32,180
you've got with ventilation but you

209
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:33,829
might investigate ok I'm near an urban

210
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:36,079
area we've got a lot of people from

211
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:39,490
Latin America they're really interested

212
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:43,820
in vegetable vegetable Y or the Asian

213
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:46,909
folks and so on so adapting to what can

214
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:51,079
be sold out of some of the more tropical

215
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:52,789
materials could be quite lucrative the

216
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:55,689
longer you can keep the crop in the

217
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:58,189
ground and keep harvesting the more

218
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,640
attractive it should be because you've

219
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,140
got a consumer base it is used to

220
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,929
getting that material from you or a

221
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:09,199
grocery store and you should be able to

222
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:13,189
make out better that way

223
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,980
and then of course you can utilize the

224
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,080
space by something climbing but you can

225
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,659
also hang stuff from the top so I'll

226
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,190
show you an example of that some work

227
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:26,360
that Neal has done on that raspberries

228
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:29,690
raspberries don't like to get rained on

229
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,970
and raspberries can be extremely

230
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,890
productive in a high tunnel environment

231
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,019
those of you that are coming this

232
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:40,639
afternoon to see our cut flower trials

233
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:44,620
over on Maple Avenue will see high

234
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:48,319
tunnel with blackberries and also with

235
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:50,929
the fall bearing raspberries that start

236
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,040
bearing in about two weeks or so and

237
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:57,289
will keep on going through October who

238
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,799
has raspberries in October in New York

239
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:01,360
State

240
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:04,459
hardly anybody but those raspberries

241
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,769
give them to a consumer and they can

242
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,990
keep them for a whole week they don't

243
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:11,299
melt down because they've been protected

244
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,870
so the diseases don't get into the fruit

245
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:16,579
so that's a very lucrative crop and it's

246
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,779
a perennial so you don't have to plant

247
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,160
it every year so something to consider

248
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:25,730
blackberries same sort of thing

249
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:28,519
very productive huge berries in fact I

250
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,470
can show you those this afternoon that's

251
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:37,519
work by dr. Marvin Fritz and his

252
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:38,259
assistants okay so bedding plants your

253
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,899
area

254
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:44,269
luckily Neal Matson has done a bunch of

255
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:46,459
work on that started in our tunnel over

256
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:50,629
and Maple Avenue but it's worked with

257
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:54,200
growers on this ton of information he

258
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:58,220
gave me 75 slides I elected not to use

259
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:01,670
them but he's sitting right down here so

260
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:04,940
you want to know about that just talk to

261
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:06,679
him and the bottom line that he

262
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,710
essentially after all the work that he's

263
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:11,479
done on it is don't use them on cold

264
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,460
sensitive crops but it's for bedding

265
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,080
plants finishing the bedding plants

266
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,750
before they're going into the earth

267
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,389
centers a high tunnel could be quite

268
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,279
useful but you have to choose wisely

269
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:26,870
which crops you're going to do

270
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:30,709
with if it's it could frost in early

271
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:34,879
spring mid-spring and you've got coleus

272
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:36,530
in there forget it it's it's gone and so

273
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,080
you have to be very careful on which

274
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:41,149
ones you do this with it's also if you

275
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,430
have a crop that you're going to be

276
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:46,220
shipping to a particular are you trying

277
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:49,399
to hit Mother's Day you know some years

278
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,440
we get a real cold spring and no amount

279
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,379
of tunnel protection without the sun

280
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,320
shining is gonna get you that crop to

281
00:13:54,379 --> 00:14:01,220
flower before Mother's Day arrives and

282
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:03,970
so that's a bit of a risky thing so not

283
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:08,090
having that deadline can can help and

284
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:10,550
you can use low tunnels and of course

285
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:12,560
nobody there's we don't have a high

286
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,240
tunnel police it comes around says you

287
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,639
said you have a high tunnel you don't

288
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,919
you putting supplementary Heat you're

289
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,659
not allowed to do that there's no such

290
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:22,639
thing if you want to put a heater in

291
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:26,149
there and keep things protected you

292
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,100
certainly can and so there is

293
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:30,740
flexibility there and in some situations

294
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,899
if it might make a lot of sense to have

295
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,389
a supplementary here during for those

296
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:37,838
cold periods to bring things are long

297
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:40,159
and it would still be a lot cheaper than

298
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,260
constructing a greenhouse with all the

299
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:50,240
bells and whistles that go with that ok

300
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:53,629
so here's some data that Neel shared for

301
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,669
one of the years the 9th in 2011 you had

302
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:58,370
a number of different bedding plant

303
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:02,088
species that he put in there in April

304
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:04,429
and the flower date in the greenhouses

305
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:06,260
so he had these parallel experiments one

306
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:09,889
in greenhouse and one in the high tunnel

307
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:13,149
and you can make the comparison the

308
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:14,720
greenhouse angelonia flowered on May 3rd

309
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:17,360
the high tunnel

310
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,790
well sorry did quite make it because

311
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,870
they did have frost events but if you

312
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:26,599
won't go to dianthus May 21 the

313
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,440
greenhouse May 29 in the high tunnels

314
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,220
not too bad

315
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:35,270
geranium almost the same time low below

316
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,040
your bed late and so on down the list

317
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:40,879
comes back to the point I was making

318
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:46,278
earlier okay so choose of species you

319
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:49,278
might do quite well nearly this set of

320
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:51,830
experiments with judge Reed Judson

321
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,990
reduced our high tunnel greenhouse

322
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:59,180
specialist for the state of New York

323
00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:03,169
more lessees over in Penn Yan but is

324
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:05,719
available for advice for other parts of

325
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:09,219
the state of of course as well and so

326
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:12,470
they were putting I think petunia right

327
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:22,910
in hanging baskets about a tomato crop

328
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:25,509
and shade they had are we got having a

329
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:25,509
problem here

330
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:34,338
diem free of course yes of course

331
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:37,339
TMP free indeed it's just an example you

332
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:45,649
could you could put other hanging basket

333
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:47,660
type stuff in it yeah so so anyway the

334
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:49,549
bottom line on this one is both craft

335
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:52,759
came through fine none of them were

336
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:56,838
diseased and the yield of the tomato was

337
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:58,939
not affected by the hanging basket yes

338
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:02,209
it is warmer in time yeah during the day

339
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:06,019
uh-huh at night the temperature is

340
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:08,619
pretty much the same yeah okay

341
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:10,730
so now we're going into cut flowers

342
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:14,708
remember I was going to talk about cut

343
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,709
flower so okay here the cut flowers

344
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,949
about 15 years ago if you went to a

345
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:23,599
place to get cut flowers you probably

346
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:25,910
couldn't get much in the way of cut

347
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,859
flowers in a grocery store or a

348
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,800
supermarket but you had to go to a

349
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:33,678
florist right and what flowers could you

350
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,789
get well roses sure no problem

351
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:40,850
and chrysanthemums yep any time of the

352
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:43,819
year and also I had carnations yes and

353
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:46,429
so on and that was pretty much it except

354
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:50,659
in the spring you could get some

355
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:52,400
tulips and slowly isn't so on but

356
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:56,570
domestic production was pretty much

357
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:00,500
minimal advance to more recent times and

358
00:17:56,569 --> 00:18:03,710
we still have the florists and even the

359
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:08,000
grocery stores are now even much more of

360
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:11,150
the grocery stores selling those for cut

361
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,720
flower species any time of the year very

362
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:19,700
reliable good varieties last life yeah

363
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:22,460
not too bad so but those are almost all

364
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,559
coming from here in this country from

365
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:28,850
South America if you're living in Europe

366
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:31,609
then it's coming more from Africa but

367
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:34,669
domestic production is really very very

368
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:39,039
minimal but we've come a long way since

369
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:42,230
then and people have started to demand

370
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,149
flowers locally we want something

371
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:48,620
different we'd like to try something

372
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:51,769
else and as a result of that that has

373
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:53,799
generated a very large industry that is

374
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:58,339
producing crops like tulips

375
00:18:53,799 --> 00:19:02,419
Gerber's lilies gladiola irises etc etc

376
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:08,689
etc okay so the industry has changed

377
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:11,870
vastly over the last few years the South

378
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,900
American production mom's on the Left I

379
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:16,189
don't know what's on bottom right

380
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:19,490
interestingly enough they're growing

381
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:22,730
them in high tunnels but in upland

382
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:25,490
valleys where the temperature is the

383
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:28,849
same all year round the day length is

384
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:31,640
the same and they keep on producing and

385
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:34,039
the labor is cheap and the flowers are

386
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,620
flown overnight to Miami and then

387
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:39,019
distribute it all over the country so

388
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:42,079
you know what's not to like about that

389
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:47,119
it's very reliable in US consumers here

390
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:51,019
like that pretty well as well but you

391
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:53,479
know we have gotten into the flower the

392
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:57,799
cut flower deal here in the States and

393
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,360
we can see the kind of species that are

394
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:03,079
being grown

395
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:08,599
and their production values in the table

396
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:11,359
here and you know it's it's pretty

397
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:14,179
substantial but it's still it was the

398
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,490
big four are still the dominant flowers

399
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,590
and it's we're never gonna do away with

400
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,120
that and that's fine you know if you

401
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:21,799
want to get married in February you're

402
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:24,500
not going to go to your local flora or

403
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:27,049
to your local producer or flowers and

404
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,529
say hey where am I where my tulips are

405
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:32,990
roses we don't have them so so that's

406
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:35,990
always going to be but we do have this

407
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:40,069
very substantial production now of cut

408
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:44,150
flowers that is produced in the States

409
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:48,579
or even more locally so to give you a

410
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:51,560
little taste of where and what

411
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:54,490
large-scale production of flowers still

412
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:59,089
is primarily in western United States

413
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:02,650
back a hundred years ago it was Long

414
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:05,990
Island New York Pennsylvania New Jersey

415
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,820
etc and then it migrated out west

416
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:11,779
because it's easier to grow stuff out

417
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:14,779
there and now it's in specialized places

418
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:17,000
where the climate is ideal so the things

419
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:20,660
like hydrangea you have these cool

420
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,450
mornings in the in Oregon every morning

421
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:26,750
is cool and cloudian hydrangea loves

422
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:29,360
that grows like fantastic or the calla

423
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,700
lilies on the right also seem to like

424
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,429
that kind of climate but it's

425
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:38,870
diversified much more than that

426
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:41,840
the picture of up at the top there fresh

427
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:47,419
tulips USA the gigantic greenhouse in

428
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:50,029
Virginia that produces tulips about nine

429
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:53,090
months of the year and its production

430
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:55,730
it's industrial production they bring

431
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:56,269
the tulips in from the bulbs in from

432
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,610
Holland

433
00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:01,309
sometimes a year other times the years

434
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:03,379
coming from Chile and they put them in

435
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:05,720
their storage rooms and give whatever

436
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,100
cold treatments needed and then they

437
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,230
bring them out into these greenhouses

438
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:12,598
there's no soil it's all just in crates

439
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:15,210
and some of them are hydroponic some of

440
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:18,239
are in some kind of special mix and

441
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,700
they're producing millions of stems that

442
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:23,009
are distributed you get them in your in

443
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,769
your supermarket you know six dollars

444
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:29,368
for a dozen and nobody can compete with

445
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:31,259
that and like it it's very nice so

446
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:35,189
that's it that's an example of the sort

447
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:39,028
of thing the other one is is not exactly

448
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:42,149
a cut flower production area but the

449
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:43,739
swamp Swan Island alias it's primarily a

450
00:22:42,148 --> 00:22:45,778
propagation of the delegates but they

451
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:49,499
have so many varieties and they do sell

452
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:53,788
some cuts from there as well whatever

453
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:56,489
guy then parts of California again have

454
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:59,190
just the ideal climate for one species

455
00:22:56,489 --> 00:23:03,979
or another and you see large-scale

456
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:06,808
outdoor production with very successful

457
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:09,838
but with the problems that they're

458
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:13,019
having with water these days who knows

459
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:15,118
it might not last that much although

460
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:16,829
this can compete with some of the other

461
00:23:15,118 --> 00:23:19,738
things like alfalfa that they're growing

462
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:23,968
with that precious water this would be a

463
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:27,450
more lucrative crop I would think okay

464
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:29,460
so let's get back to New York State we

465
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,609
do have some large-scale producers in

466
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,979
fact within an hour's drive of here

467
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,538
we've got some quite substantial peony

468
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:41,639
producers up in the Geneva area that

469
00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:47,038
produce peony cut stems and send them

470
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:49,528
down to New York Washington etc also on

471
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:52,019
Long Island the industry is coming back

472
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:54,628
to some extent larger scale again

473
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:58,759
because the proximity of consumers down

474
00:23:54,628 --> 00:24:02,038
in that part of the state dahlias cleome

475
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:05,788
etc etc so quite a bit of production

476
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:08,669
coming back but what's more prevalent to

477
00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:12,210
and perhaps more familiar to you all is

478
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:15,389
the small scale producer it has cut

479
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:18,509
flowers as a part of a larger maybe

480
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:22,519
vegetable operation or someone that's

481
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:25,319
just doing a you know a few hundred

482
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:28,319
square feet or eight

483
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:32,308
two acres of cut flowers that they then

484
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:38,129
locally take to the farmers market or to

485
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:40,168
grocery stores etc and the the the nice

486
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:44,778
thing about this whole trade is that it

487
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:47,788
is such a vast number of species that

488
00:24:44,778 --> 00:24:51,839
are potentially used for cut flowers or

489
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:55,919
cut stems or cut foliage woodies etc etc

490
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:58,019
and we're very privileged to have the

491
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,230
authors of the Bible of this kind of

492
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:04,079
work with us in the audience you heard

493
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:06,569
from one already the man with the abouts

494
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,750
and the second one is Judy Lauchlan

495
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:11,908
who's sitting in in the back here to the

496
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,119
executive director of an organization

497
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:17,850
I'm going to mention a little later on

498
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:21,750
so they wrote the book there are 83

499
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:23,548
species in there vastra in there have

500
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:26,750
been others discovered quote unquote

501
00:25:23,548 --> 00:25:30,179
since then so the list is even longer

502
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:32,339
but that's part of the fun of working in

503
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:35,519
cut flowers listed you saying hey we

504
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:41,128
could use that for cuts maybe so just

505
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:44,370
some scenes from local producers in

506
00:25:41,128 --> 00:25:46,558
their beds of same years oftentimes part

507
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:49,709
of a tour where we're going to visit

508
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:55,558
them and and see what they were doing

509
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:59,519
so our production locally then is local

510
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:01,259
seasonal many species it avoids the big

511
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,690
four because we can't compete really

512
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:07,620
very well with that and the emphasis is

513
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:10,620
on quality and it's also these species

514
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:12,239
don't ship very well oftentimes but fine

515
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:14,489
you put a bouquet together you take it

516
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:19,829
home you put it in the Vaz you at least

517
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:21,329
should have it for a week okay and then

518
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:22,829
what did they do with them well I've

519
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,538
already mentioned it to some extent

520
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:30,480
farmers markets probably the largest

521
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:33,329
outlet supermarkets weddings roadside

522
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,569
stands the summit extent working with

523
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:37,609
restaurants and bouquet or other

524
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:40,548
businesses

525
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:45,259
that value fresh flowers have a

526
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:47,750
subscription service and then finally

527
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:52,640
we're getting to the high tunnel as a

528
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:54,740
place to grow these things and they're

529
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,460
very suitable the high tunnel structure

530
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:04,490
is well suited for producing high

531
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:06,980
quality flowers because you can grow a

532
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:09,769
lot in a small space the tunnels

533
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,179
themselves are valuable real estate so

534
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:13,369
the more you can pack in there the

535
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:15,290
better and if you choose the species

536
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:19,759
that can be harvested over a period of

537
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:22,700
time it allows you to have quite a nice

538
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,650
income so an extended growing season

539
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,169
because you're protecting against frost

540
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:29,630
in the spring you're protecting against

541
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:32,360
cold weather in the fall you're

542
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:36,669
protecting against wind which allows the

543
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:40,339
plants to grow taller and straighter and

544
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:46,690
you have the disease reduced because of

545
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:49,849
the drier environment inside and the

546
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:52,250
high tunnel environment is so near of

547
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:54,740
that of a greenhouse that you can use

548
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:58,069
all the tricks that John Sanderson would

549
00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:02,720
tell us about in terms of natural

550
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:05,269
enemies to keep things like aphids

551
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:10,190
thrips the white flies and set are under

552
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:12,950
control so it does allow us quite a bit

553
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:16,548
of control methods that outside in the

554
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:18,690
field we are not able to use now it

555
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:23,769
isn't all rosy

556
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:26,680
and I would paint a wrong picture if I

557
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:32,440
didn't mention also this quite personal

558
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:35,710
picture on the left one does get snow

559
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:38,620
events and one does need to be ready for

560
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,759
it in that particular time we weren't

561
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:43,199
ready

562
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:45,940
we disregarded the manufacturer's

563
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,640
warning don't keep the cover on over

564
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,769
winter and we've gotten away with it for

565
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,320
two or three years and then I got a

566
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:56,980
phone call from the farm manager on my

567
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:59,710
birthday February 26 he said Chris I've

568
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:06,849
got some bad news for you yeah what Oh

569
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:10,120
your tunnel collapse and there are

570
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:12,419
places in this in this world where high

571
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:17,379
winds can occur this is Long Island

572
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:19,360
Experiment Station yeah where if you

573
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,180
don't have your plastic really pin down

574
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:25,029
well you can end up with shreds of

575
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:28,690
plastic all over the place and so high

576
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:30,549
winds can be a problem and up and do

577
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:35,019
require a special construction

578
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:37,919
techniques we have not a since not had a

579
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:42,519
problem we've kept the plastic on our

580
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:45,640
high tunnel for the last that was 2010

581
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,650
so the last five years without any

582
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,820
problem even though we did have snow and

583
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:54,930
the trick is to anticipate the snowfall

584
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:57,460
event and have a salamander heater

585
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:59,289
inside the structure to keep it warm

586
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:04,750
enough so that the snow slides off

587
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:07,119
instead of depositing itself well this

588
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:09,670
well this has a peak but it wasn't

589
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:13,000
enough of a peak and it was a wet heavy

590
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:15,640
snow that collapsed it down in that

591
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,779
regard so but there are ways to get

592
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:22,540
around that okay so what kind of things

593
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:25,809
already mentioned we need stuff of high

594
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:29,500
value we want a long harvest season we

595
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:31,629
want them early as possible and we want

596
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,569
high quality of the tunnel

597
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:39,910
so the crop over the top well let me

598
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:43,029
just go through high-value okay so how

599
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:45,190
much money can you make and we like to

600
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:47,889
compete against the tomato roars so we

601
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:52,870
say okay let's just put some of these

602
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:55,120
figures together and and a graduate

603
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:59,678
student and when Cayuga who some of you

604
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:02,859
I'm sure know put together this economic

605
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,320
analysis that took into consideration

606
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:09,129
the cost of building this structure as

607
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:13,079
well as what the income could be from

608
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:17,230
that and turned out that the lisianthus

609
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:19,689
gave you an income of $2 per square foot

610
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:22,620
just not too bad a couple of years you

611
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:25,269
got that Tunnel paid for more then

612
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:28,808
sunflowers just a single crop of

613
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:30,429
sunflowers only gave you 14 cents well

614
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:33,879
you wouldn't just grow a single crop of

615
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:35,860
sunflowers you put in more stuff so and

616
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:40,809
then the tomatoes come in sort of in

617
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:46,479
between depending on this size and the

618
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:49,359
the cost of the structure about 40 down

619
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,250
to 60 cents or so and then cukes by

620
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,849
themselves just a single crop of cubes

621
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:59,829
forget it don't everything lose money

622
00:31:54,849 --> 00:32:02,519
okay okay so what kind of stuff do we

623
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:05,349
grow in there well some people try

624
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:08,650
foolishly myself tried to see okay can

625
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:11,589
we really do tulips and I will say that

626
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:13,240
tulips have a nice strong stem and I'm

627
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:15,788
much nicer than the ones you get in the

628
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,679
grocery store but nevertheless you're

629
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:19,359
competing with a flood and it's really

630
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,030
hard unless you've got something very

631
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,009
special the other one that's that has

632
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:28,240
turned out to be quite interesting for

633
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:31,599
us is anemone and ranunculus and it uses

634
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:36,609
a deadtime in a high tunnel we we plant

635
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:40,149
the bulbs in mid-december in the tunnel

636
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:42,500
and we are finished harvesting by late

637
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:45,440
May June and they

638
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:48,380
produce beautiful stands and gorgeous

639
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,960
colors that's a really serious one that

640
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,630
that uses a time of the year that

641
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,150
otherwise the tunnel is not really very

642
00:32:53,630 --> 00:33:00,500
productive for so that's one really to

643
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:03,320
watch other spring crops more

644
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:07,869
traditionally early season planted so

645
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:11,059
Larkspur or sweet peas Campania 'la

646
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:13,250
companion medium that just look

647
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:20,079
wonderful and but they won't be out

648
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:23,569
until about June or so out of the tunnel

649
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:24,169
spring spring planted Snapdragon works

650
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:29,240
pretty well

651
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:32,450
go disha stock again our spring crops

652
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:35,900
that would be of interest mentioned as

653
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:40,730
the antis already it has a beautiful

654
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:42,290
elegant flower and there's lots of

655
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:45,470
different varieties different colors

656
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:47,599
look enough like roses they don't have

657
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,970
the scent of roses not that watered

658
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:53,149
roses have much of a scent anyway but

659
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:55,910
this is a very productive and lucrative

660
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:59,750
crop as I mentioned already then yes

661
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:01,790
dahlias again snaps are things that grow

662
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:05,930
quite well in tunnels and have a high

663
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:08,690
quality celosia amaranth are really

664
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:11,869
tropical so they love the warmth of the

665
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:14,210
tunnel and get enormous size if you let

666
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:17,210
them lots of different varieties even

667
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:21,829
the ropey one that Alan was showing us

668
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:26,659
earlier and then extending the season

669
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:28,730
into the fall you can get a falls in

670
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:32,419
your crop and keep it protected against

671
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:35,690
the cooler conditions the Snapdragon

672
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:38,299
crop also does quite well in the fall

673
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:41,269
what we've normally done is more

674
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,940
recently is say okay sometimes our

675
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:47,139
snapdragons overwinter for us in the

676
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:50,030
garden so what about the protection

677
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,399
structure of a high tunnel can't we keep

678
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,780
that over winter so we've done some

679
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:55,880
experiments over the last two years

680
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:59,690
where we're sewing the crop

681
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:02,599
in June or July transplanting into the

682
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:05,179
tunnel getting a fall crop off but it

683
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,789
then instead of yanking it out you just

684
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:10,909
protect it with a low tunnel come back

685
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:15,079
in the spring and harvest again so

686
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:18,589
getting 20 that's even 30 stems per

687
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,750
plant on a 9 by 9 inch spacing it's

688
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:24,440
pretty good and those of you that are

689
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:26,780
coming this afternoon to see our work at

690
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,510
Maple Avenue in the tunnel will have a

691
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:33,110
chance to see the crop that's more than

692
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:39,200
a year old now and it's gotten to be a

693
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:41,090
pest afraid yeah invasive market and

694
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,589
then the other things that don't

695
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:45,140
necessarily have to be in a final

696
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:48,680
situation but ornamental kale ornamental

697
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:50,719
cabbage the varieties are grow tall can

698
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,269
make a nice crop the picture on the left

699
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:58,639
is from Vancouver area in British

700
00:35:53,269 --> 00:36:02,119
Columbia how many I'm just about I'm

701
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:03,859
just like three slides away ok so we've

702
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:06,049
got all these species we've got all this

703
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:08,539
stuff you know all these things

704
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:11,180
some of us and others they want to get

705
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:13,730
into cut flowers but were they gonna get

706
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:16,699
the information well cut flower growers

707
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:18,940
are not so numerous yet that you can ask

708
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:21,829
Cooperative Extension of New York State

709
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:25,099
about growing this or that or the other

710
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:28,519
thing well luckily we have an

711
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:31,610
organization which covers that area

712
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:34,820
tremendously well and again I'm

713

this organization are here in your

716
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:48,380
audience again dr. Armitage before he

717
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:53,440
got on to other things he was a founder

718
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:56,200

719
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,780
executive director of the Association of

720
00:36:56,199 --> 00:37:03,579
cut flower growers Judy lachemann back

00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:05,750
here and she has information and and

722
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:07,920
literature if you're interested in

723
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:10,440
getting into cut flowers I

724
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,829
strongly urge you to talk to her and get

725
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,990
that information the ASC FG also has a

726
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:21,000
wonderful website with lots of

727
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:24,558
information their quarterly magazine is

728
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,329
certainly worth reading annual meetings

729
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:31,410
are occurring in different parts we had

730
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:35,309
it on Long Island what was it six seven

731
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:38,190
years ago and regional meetings have

732
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:39,960
occurred here in Ithaca but also are

733
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:44,369
scattered around the next one is in

734
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:47,278
Virginia third week of September if some

735
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:50,700
of you would be interested there's a

736
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:52,710
listserv we can ask a question oh gosh I

737
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:56,000
having trouble with this Dahlia variety

738
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:58,588
can you tell me what might be wrong and

739
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,409
so somebody else writes back to say oh

740
00:37:58,588 --> 00:38:02,818
yeah I had some same problem last year

741
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:05,548
this is what you need to do about it

742
00:38:02,818 --> 00:38:07,528
and things like that very useful and

743
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:11,909
there's a national coordinated variety

744
00:38:07,528 --> 00:38:15,599
trial primarily open annual species but

745
00:38:11,909 --> 00:38:18,929
also into perennials and woody species

746
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,349
that the growers themselves participate

747
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:25,409
in and provide the information and the

748
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:26,940
website I've already mentioned and to

749
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:30,899
let you know this is the hottest

750
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,608
information just produce you know

751
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,619
there's a grow local movement and

752
00:38:32,608 --> 00:38:38,190
there's a do local than local local

753
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:45,269
local local this is the membership

754
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:49,588
numbers of the ASC FG since 2009 and if

755
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:55,489
you don't think that local is real just

756
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:58,940
look at that okay and it's going up so

757
00:38:55,489 --> 00:39:02,149
yeah most organizations are going down

758
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:05,679
this one is climbing and it's growers

759
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:08,930
helping each other sharing information

760
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:14,029
enjoying what they're doing and the

761
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:18,409
membership is what 70% female I think

762
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:20,660
probably and most of them are all of the

763
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:22,309
families left so what am I going to do I

764
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:29,289
really love flowers I'd like to do

765
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:32,269
something let me get into this okay and

766
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:35,539
then other information we've done some

767
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:39,250
stuff others as I've mentioned already

768
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:42,739
judge read Neal Madsen etc there are

769
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:45,130
high tunnel websites we have a high

770
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:48,859
tunnel web site here as well of course

771
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:52,660
the work we've done on cut flowers is in

772
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:54,860
the horticulture queen research page

773
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:58,759
every year of research that we've done

774
00:39:54,860 --> 00:40:00,849
is on there and then there's books like

775
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:05,030
the Bible I mentioned earlier and the

776
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:08,569
flower farmer by Lynn Basinski is also

777
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:11,600
quite a useful piece of information and

778
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:14,200
that's all the time I have and thank you

779
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,199
