1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,900
&gt;&gt; Viburnum utile 'Co noy'.

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,410
This is a hybrid between burkwoodii and utile.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,250
This fairly new viburnum has

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,160
very shiny small leaves with

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,734
a naked terminal flower bud at the apex of the stem.

6
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:21,839
Because it is a hybrid with burkwoodii,

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,250
the leaves are fairly scurfy or sandpapery-like.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,070
This is Viburnum utile 'Conoy'.
