1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:12,960
so starting with a little background

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,330
Noah is a crowdsourced Network the

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,700
weather station owners share the weather

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,190
data through the network and provide to

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,799
us feedback and guidance on what we

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,080
should or should not be do doing what we

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,599
could do better weather data is

10
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:30,479
collected every 15 minutes and tabulated

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,429
and hourly and daily summaries we're

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,219
collecting precipitation temperature

13
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:39,119
relative humidity leaf wetness solar

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,920
radiation wind speed wind direction and

15
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,509
growers that purchase these weather

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,309
instruments now have the option of

17
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:47,280
getting soil moisture and soil

18
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:49,409
temperature sensors but we still haven't

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,570
put into place the API that will

20
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,038
actually pull that data in we need to go

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,619
to one minute data and we're going to be

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,939
doing that this fall

23
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:59,878
sister stations in the network are

24
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,369
designated for missing data to fill gaps

25
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:03,899
so that we don't have bizarre

26
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:06,929
accumulated degree days and things like

27
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,489
that with a lot of missing data or will

28
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,320
extrapolate one our gaps in our data

29
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:15,478
the decision support tools are primarily

30
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,949
for IP on but we also have some for crop

31
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,200
production which is why I'm here today

32
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,540
to share those with you and they are

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,728
built obviously from that weather data

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,360
so a little bit more about Noah's

35
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:28,920
history it was created in 1996 by Curt

36
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,780
pet salt at that time he was the

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,269
vegetable IPM coordinator the New York

38
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,670
State IPM program originally it was an

39
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:36,978
association they charged membership fees

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,399
and

41
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:43,530
today it's open access with land-grant

42
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:46,079
university partners and grower

43
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,359
Association partners initially we

44
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,889
started out with sensor and Campbell

45
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,750
instruments sensor was bought by

46
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,640
sensotronic those instruments went

47
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,560
obsolete today we're partnering with

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,299
rain wise incorporated for all of our

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,460
weather instrumentation for the most

50
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,860
part although we do have a number of

51
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,250
onset instruments in the network some of

52
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,950
you may be using the name brand hobo as

53
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:11,009
little data loggers onset is the company

54
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,960
that manufactures those we also pull in

55
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,259
National Weather Service Airport data

56
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,689
and we partner with state climatologist

57
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:20,429
nets currently right now our

58
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:21,919
when an only partner is the New Jersey

59
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,930
State Climatologist

60
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,209
but we're working on some other meza net

61
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,590
partners

62
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:31,260
initially we were going out with our

63
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,310
laptops and manually downloading these

64
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:37,229
data bring in back creating messages

65
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,229
putting those messages on a system

66
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:43,379
called kota phone and growers could dial

67
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:45,989
in to those and get that message du jour

68
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,430
about what was going on what the IPM

69
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,960
program thought that people should be

70
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,670
paying attention to we switch to modems

71
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,530
I'm glad to say we've saved about eight

72
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:57,059
thousand dollars in operating costs by

73
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,719
eliminating our modems and phone lines

74
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,449
so that was a big savings which was

75
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:07,439
important when Noah was zero funded oh

76
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:10,409
and I say Noah Don said niwe and it's

77
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,629
like potato potato it's fine

78
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,879
everything's good so if you hear me say

79
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,969
Noah just know that I am talking about

80
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,639
the same thing

81
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:23,819
so today we have a few stations that are

82
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,699
still using file transfer protocol but

83
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,709
most are using Internet Protocol to send

84
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,810
the data directly to a website a train

85
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,750
wise we scrape that data off their web

86
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,479
into our database and rain was has

87
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,840
developed a cellular data modem systems

88
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,129
so for growers who have a desire to have

89
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,080
a weather instrument but it's a very

90
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,319
remote location they don't have

91
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,940
broadband they can use the cellular data

92
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,489
option

93
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:53,310
we're now up to 432 weather stations

94
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:57,750
last time I gave this talk a month ago

95
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:00,420
in Plant Pathology we had 428 so we're

96
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,060
growing all the time just all the time

97
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,619
growing so that's pretty exciting we

98
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,370
have weather stations were pulling data

99
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,580
in in 23 States we have 10 member states

100
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,439
and then grower members in

101
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,480
additional five other states that it

102
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,540
could swelled up when we have airports

103
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,519
in states that are neighboring a grower

104
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,650
owned weather instrument because we need

105
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,750
that sister data we need complementary

106
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:27,069
data so that we know that we're not

107
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,069
going to have outages so open access

108
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:32,290
real-time query based decision support

109
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,959
with built-in bio fix in an interactive

110
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,670
user interface

111
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,829
this is our current website built in

112
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,150
2009 I know for the Millennials in the

113
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:45,189
audience you're going to be groaning oh

114
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:47,469
my gosh that's so old I know it's pretty

115
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:50,290
much geriatric now and we're trying to

116
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:54,400
get money to rebuild our website so far

117
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:57,510
two grants later no bites but will still

118
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,949
continue trying the blue menu at the top

119
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:02,709
pretty audience in Geneva I'll try to

120
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:04,509
use the cursor as a player so this blue

121
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:07,599
menu follows you throughout the website

122
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:10,899
and gets gives you access to all of the

123
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,310
tools and products on anh nua and up

124
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:15,429
here there's a kind of neat little

125
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,230
utility that I like it's a find the

126
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,269
National Weather Service weather

127
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,810
forecast for your location you just

128
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:25,750
enter your city state zip code and hit

129
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,610
go and it'll get you to that National

130
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,500
Weather Service page with forecast data

131
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,040
etc

132
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:36,100
on this map which starts out here it

133
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,950
will save your location you know how it

134
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,870
is now if you don't disable location

135
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:44,949
services on your phone your phone always

136
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:47,290
knows where you are and so does noah it

137
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,089
knows where you are so the next time you

138
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,360
go in if you're in North Carolina that

139
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:55,629
map's going to Center on North Carolina

140
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,030
instead of New York State so we try to

141
00:05:55,629 --> 00:06:00,250
do little things as we can to make the

142
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:03,009
end user experience more fun and

143
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,709
exciting every weather station has a

144
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:07,779
station page and on the station pages

145
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:10,060
basically the key is that there are

146
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:12,489
these quick links to the pest forecasts

147
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,280
that will give you the result for that

148
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,769
pest forecast or that tool right there

149
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,739
for today's date it defaults to the

150
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:23,019
current date and then here there are

151
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:27,300
some quick links to weather products

152
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:27,299
degree days hourly data etc

153
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:34,538
so here's newaz map the green icons on

154
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,609
there are the new aware that are owned

155
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:38,469
primarily by growers but some are owned

156
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,139
by the land grant in to shun for

157
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,240
instance Connecticut's land grant Yukon

158
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,160
they manage all of their weather

159
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,290
stations they have about 40 in their

160
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,560
network one in every County and then

161
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,990
some additional ones on grower farms and

162
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,269
in primarily their focus is the turf and

163
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,180
landscape industry with those

164
00:06:55,269 --> 00:07:00,549
county-based instruments then if you can

165
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,160
see there the little air airplane icons

166
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,290
those are the airport locations and then

167
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,930
this map here shows you the member

168
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,419
states that are in purple and then in

169
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,030
orange are those states where there are

170
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:14,769
one or two maybe three individual

171
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:17,589
growers that have purchased a weather

172
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:19,149
station and are subscribing into the

173
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:21,429
newest system it's about two hundred and

174
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:24,969
ninety dollars a year for an individual

175
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:27,519
subscriber and if you're a statewide

176
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,830
member an unlimited number of weather

177
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:33,250
stations can connect to nua for a fee of

178
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:35,079
1750 per year so that's essentially our

179
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,910
revenue stream you can do the math and

180
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,849
you can see that we operate on something

181
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,729
less than twenty thousand dollars a year

182
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:44,500
fairly limited revenue stream but it's

183
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,240
growing we've got over four hundred and

184
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,689
thirty stations now so it's pretty

185
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,819
exciting I haven't shown this slide in

186
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:53,949
my previous seminars but I thought okay

187
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:56,620
I'll show this to you guys so this is

188
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:59,110
where the data is going how how it moves

189
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,509
around so we start with the weather

190
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,550
station the data goes to rain wise net

191
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:05,649
we scrape it off and following the black

192
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,939
arrows goes into our new a database

193
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:09,629
which is at the Northeast Regional

194
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:12,180
Climate Center and then pushes that data

195
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:16,120
to the newest server

196
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:20,530
where it goes through a number of tools

197
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:25,750
and algorithms etc and then the end user

198
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:28,299
will access that anh nua cornell.edu we

199
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:31,089
also have some metadata for quality

200
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,028
control and that informs the newest

201
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:35,819
server location of the station page for

202
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:38,110
instance

203
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,510
so that gives you you know just gives

204
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,190
you in a nutshell kind of where what

205
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:43,418
we're doing with cloud computing and

206
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,670
what we're we're moving all of these

207
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:48,720
data

208
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:51,839
so how does nua or nua fit the programs

209
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,930
of the horticulture section so obviously

210
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,879
plant developing mental models plant

211
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:59,459
phenology models can be developed into

212
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,289
tools to inform management decisions and

213
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,650
I'll show you a couple of these it

214
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:06,750
during today's seminar weather data can

215
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:09,509
be used to validate and implement

216
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,850
horticulture models and obviously the

217
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:15,330
data and models that are in nua can be

218
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:18,300
used for research teaching and extension

219
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:21,290
so for instance Greg I'm not going to no

220
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:24,569
pressure here Ian merwin used to use

221
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:28,559
some of the new Apple models for his

222
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:32,150
teaching so I didn't mean that to be in

223
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:37,319
any way a plug or if you know so giddy

224
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:39,419
right okay there you go so the idea was

225
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,220
hey Julie you really should tell people

226
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:43,519
about nua you should get the word out

227
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,960
that is what my

228
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,289
group of state coordinators has been

229
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,600
telling me so these seminars I'm trying

230
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,669
to tell the Cornell community about nua

231
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,230
so that you're aware of this some of

232
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:57,240
these data could enrich your own

233
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,230
research programs and teaching programs

234
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,029
and I want to definitely stimulate

235
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,360
thinking about developing and utilizing

236
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:07,199
nua to benefit our

237
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,409
agricultural and horticultural

238
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,780
commodities

239
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:14,730
so I'm going to now talk about what the

240
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,459
predictive tools are that are in nua

241
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:20,339
increasingly I oh up and they were

242
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:23,759
called models disease forecast models

243
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:26,760
insect phenology models increasingly now

244
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:29,610
they're called tools and for those of

245
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,740
you who were kind of in this arena it's

246
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,200
not even precision agriculture anymore

247
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,990
it's being called digital agriculture so

248
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,050
increasingly growers are utilizing this

249
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:42,080
type of technology in their crop

250
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:45,569
production practices

251
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,940
so I'm going to spend a little bit of

252
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,160
time on pest forecast tools like nothing

253
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,440
more than this one slide just to give

254
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:55,259
you a flavor that here this is the

255
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,780
drop-down menu from the new Oh website

256
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,399
of what we currently have available this

257
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,230
menu has shrunk

258
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,360
because we've started combining into one

259
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,490
page

260
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,830
onion models for instance are all the

261
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,350
disease models are all in one page the

262
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,970
grape models are all in one page it just

263
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,850
makes it a little bit easier for the end

264
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:18,509
user but we have 16 plant disease tools

265
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,330
11 insect phenology tools we're now

266
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:23,370
providing 5 day forecasts and details on

267
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:26,120
past and current conditions in most of

268
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:30,779
our tools so the grower can look forward

269
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,909
five days and no they have to plan to do

270
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:35,610
some sort of intervention on the farm

271
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:39,289
and what we want growers to be able to

272
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:42,620
do is to assess risk learn about IPM and

273
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:44,759
get decision support through nua

274
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,320
the weather products I'm going to spend

275
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,929
a little more time on because I think

276
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,850
there are more relevant to the

277
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:53,669
horticulture arena where we're looking

278
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,500
at plant development we might be wanting

279
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:58,049
to know more about just growing degree

280
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,960
days and the tabulation of degree days

281
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:03,479
so we're currently tabulating degree

282
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,570
days for 12 based temperatures we

283
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,980
accumulate that value starting January

284
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:13,560
one March one april one and May one

285
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,210
primarily informed by the commodities

286
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:18,329
that we're working with so for instance

287
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:22,320
in apples which I know probably more

288
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:26,160
about than any of the other crops that

289
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:30,930
are that have tools on nua in Apple's

290
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:33,929
via basically the common tenet is that

291
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:36,000
there's no growth before march first and

292
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:38,250
we don't even bother looking at

293
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,519
accumulation of degree days before march

294
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:43,230
first well guess what

295
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:46,049
climate change is changing that and

296
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:49,370
indeed we are getting weird things going

297
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:52,889
on before march first now

298
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:55,470
so the exciting thing is the degree date

299
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:58,480
calculator we had created a degree day

300
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,850
calculator in PHP beyond our ancient

301
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,879
website before the one I'm showing you

302
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:06,220
today and because the programming

303
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,679
language wasn't compatible with the new

304
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,600
system we didn't get this degree too

305
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:14,219
calculated resurrected until this year

306
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,080
so it's really exciting to be able to

307
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,960
use a degree day calculator and once

308
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,590
again so a little bit about all of these

309
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:25,870
various degree days that are in nua so

310
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:28,660
you might say well why do you have just

311
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:30,570
12 based temperatures the reason is that

312
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:33,159
we're already using

313
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,190
these base temperatures shown in this

314
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:39,639
table for a number of different tools in

315
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,650
nua and so we use that as our drop-down

316
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,159
selection because the algorithms are

317
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:46,240
already built they're already there a

318
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:49,179
couple of these I want to bring to your

319
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,629
attention the seed corn maggot 39

320
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:54,370
degrees Fahrenheit one and the 14.3

321
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:56,500
degrees centigrade one for brown

322
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,620
marmorated stink bug have no tools

323
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:02,350
associated with them at all there is no

324
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,470
brown marmorated stink bug developmental

325
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:07,690
model right now

326
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:11,399
available but research has shown that

327
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:14,650
its base temperature for development is

328
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,899
14.3 centigrade and so I said okay well

329
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:20,049
let's just put that in New what people

330
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:23,250
can then query that or look at the

331
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:28,079
tables for degree days knowing that and

332
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,080
basically make some intuitive

333
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,669
inferences or deductions from the data

334
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,460
as it's being calculated the seed corn

335
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:38,349
maggot one was developed because my

336
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:42,340
colleague can wise who works with field

337
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:44,590
crops has a newsletter and he said Julie

338
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:48,610
you know I'd love to be able to

339
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,899
calculate based degree days for base 39

340
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,639
Fahrenheit so that I can put the

341
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:53,649
information in my newsletter because I

342
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,139
know it when it gets to a certain point

343
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:58,209
seed corn maggot is at this stage and

344
00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:00,069
then I alert the growers through my

345
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,540
newsletter and so he can look at that

346
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,350
for all the different locations across

347
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:07,399
New York put that in his newsletter now

348
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:09,590
so that's kind of that's kind of maybe

349
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,779
how things get started they get rolling

350
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,310
along just because you know that there's

351
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:14,659
a base development of temperature

352
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:17,449
there's a model out there and somebody

353
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:21,379
wants a piece of it for all the rest of

354
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:23,660
these there is an actual tool in nua for

355
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:27,710
them and obviously for growing degree

356
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:30,289
days GDD that's just again also just the

357
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:33,620
degree date tables it's not going to say

358
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:37,969
expect lilac to be at this phenological

359
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:40,190
stage with this accumulation of GDD so

360
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,740
you know that's that's where I rely on

361
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,890
the faculty across Cornell and across

362
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:49,299
the reach of nua to say I'd love to have

363
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:51,980
a model that did this let's develop it

364
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:54,949
this is the degree day calculator and

365
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:58,639
this shows you essentially how all of

366
00:15:54,950 --> 00:16:00,650
the tools on nua are built most of them

367
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,620
some of them are slightly different but

368
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:05,209
they all will have a little query on the

369
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,389
left hand side where you select the

370
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:11,480
state weather station the type of degree

371
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:13,819
day in this case I chose base 50 the

372
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,789
accumulation start date I allowed this

373
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,970
to default to January one and the end

374
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:22,579
date men you hit get report

375
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,139
the model starts out with a map so it

376
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,970
starts out with a map that way you don't

377
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:28,330
have to know the station name you can

378
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,259
actually look at the map and say okay

379
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:34,370
geographically this one's going to be

380
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:35,629
closest but from an altitude perspective

381
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,500
I think I'm going to select this other

382
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:41,419
one because the topography might might

383
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,009
be better with better match at that

384
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:44,990
other weather station location so the

385
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:47,059
map gives a little more flexibility than

386
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,549
just knowing the name of the weather

387
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:52,609
station location as soon as you hit get

388
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:54,919
report the wheel starts turning that

389
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,860
query is sent to the server and the

390
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:00,679
results page pops back up

391
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:03,379
so this chart builds and wherever you

392
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:06,438
scroll your mouse over the chart this

393
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:08,930
pop-up box will pop up and give you the

394
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:12,920
actual data for that particular point

395
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:16,318
the chart above again gives the past the

396
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:20,339
current and the five-day forecast out

397
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:23,220
the daily degree days base 50 and the

398
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:26,308
seasonal accumulation starting as my

399
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,159
query requested from January first and

400
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:31,349
you can see we started to get colder in

401
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:34,289
mid-september and yeah it's kind of

402
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:35,658
chilly now I had frost at my house last

403
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:37,829
night

404
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:42,120
here's another way that you can use

405
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:46,199
weather data in hindsight gee I think it

406
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:48,869
got really cold on februari 14th this

407
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,850
past winter and it was really mild for a

408
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:55,699
long time and indeed this cold snap a

409
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:58,079
number of people are attributing to

410
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,750
one of the big reasons why we didn't

411
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,928
have a lot of stone fruit this year in

412
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:06,589
New York so apricots peaches nectarines

413
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:08,639
sweet cherries

414
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:09,720
could have been significant with the

415
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:11,189
flower buds could have been

416
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,110
significantly damaged by this

417
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,899
temperature event so if you're looking

418
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:19,229
at the daily summary table circled here

419
00:18:15,898 --> 00:18:20,268
you can see how mild these temperatures

420
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,970
were

421
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:26,579
leading up to this the max temperature

422
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,159
and the men temperature and then we got

423
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:32,128
down to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit

424
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,360
which is pretty significant and then if

425
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:35,128
you wanted to look at this from an

426
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,028
hourly standpoint you could query the

427
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:41,490
hourly data and you can see

428
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:43,829
each hour how cold it was and for how

429
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,798
long the cold event lasted because

430
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:48,538
sometimes that also weighs in on the

431
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:52,398
level of damage that you'll get on

432
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:55,128
flower buds and vegetative buds in

433
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:58,199
woody plants

434
00:18:55,128 --> 00:19:00,869
another another way that you can use the

435
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,669
data in nua is to look at rainfall data

436
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:05,209
so I was giving a talk in North Carolina

437
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:07,980
to the Apple Growers Association and I

438
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,360
said to Jean Clem straw who had set up a

439
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,389
weather instrument the year before I

440
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,278
said hey gene is there something that

441
00:19:11,388 --> 00:19:16,798
that happened so I could go into the

442
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:19,230
data up pull that out and share with the

443
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,929
audience and we can talk about the use

444
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,778
of nua data for for something and he

445
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:26,070
said oh yeah we got eight inches of rain

446
00:19:24,778 --> 00:19:28,919
in October when we were trying to

447
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:30,388
harvest our apples for at it we couldn't

448
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,070
get in there to in a timely way to

449
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:35,788
harvest our apples we had to wait and

450
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:36,829
wait it out so I went into these are in

451
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:39,240
monthly

452
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:42,689
and that's another thing I want to point

453
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,298
out with this slide is the data is in

454
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,950
monthly tables so in order to get data

455
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:49,648
that spans like the end of sep tember

456
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,850
into the early october you have to go to

457
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:53,609
the month of September in the month of

458
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:55,859
October obviously so this just shows the

459
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:58,378
month of October and you can see here

460
00:19:55,859 --> 00:20:01,288
the daily data three inches of rain on

461
00:19:58,378 --> 00:20:03,599
one day an inch each of the previous two

462
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:05,179
days and then if you look down the

463
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,908
hourly data

464
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:10,350
you'll see that at some point

465
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:11,850
we were we were getting a half an inch

466
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,888
of rain a third of an inch of rain a

467
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:17,009
quarter of an inch of rain per hour was

468
00:20:13,888 --> 00:20:18,829
falling and that is kind of what the

469
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:22,399
projection is that we're going to be

470
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:24,928
needing to expect in to plan for given

471
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:26,028
climate change we're going to have these

472
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:29,629
intense

473
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:32,878
rainfall events and these bizarre

474
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:36,209
temperature events that may impact our

475
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:39,000
crops and this type of data gives the

476
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,159
grower the ability to document that

477
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,079
something really bad happened and if

478
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:45,840
they have crop insurance than they can

479
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:49,428
document that this significant event

480
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,428
happened and damaged their crop

481
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:54,330
so now I'm going to start our I'm going

482
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,120
to go over the crop management tools

483
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:59,009
that are in nua there are three that are

484
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,969
really knew a based I'll cover those

485
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:05,819
towards the end of this segment

486
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:08,850
again we're assessing risk we're getting

487
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:10,939
decision support and the primary ones we

488
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:14,099
have in nua that are that are

489
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,649
currently programed in as tools are crop

490
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:19,378
load management tool for apple and an

491
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:22,219
irrigation tool for apple and obviously

492
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,219
growing degree days

493
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:29,669
this is a tool that was created by Frank

494
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:32,309
Rossi and art de gaetano with the

495
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:35,490
Northeast Regional Climate Center so

496
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:37,980
this is their forecast suite of tools

497
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:41,220
and what I do then is I link to these

498
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:43,380
within nua these are not using nua data

499
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,799
they're using the cooperative weather

500
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,630
observer program data these are human

501
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,029
beings that are still observing weather

502
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,340
for the National Weather Service and

503
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:55,369
have been doing that since I believe the

504
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:58,349
1800s some sites

505
00:21:55,369 --> 00:22:01,709
so these data are then used drive a

506
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:04,439
suite of disease risk models turpin weed

507
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:08,000
development irrigation information and

508
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,000
heat stress and frost

509
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:12,679
some of these tools have been built for

510
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,840
apple frost risk

511
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,090
aren't de gaetano built these and these

512
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,369
again these maps if you click on these

513
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:22,679
maps they'll blow up but you can't at

514
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:25,199
this point zoom right in so the

515
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,299
resolution of these maps is not high

516
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,720
resolution you can't zoom right in on

517
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:33,779
these locations

518
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:37,759
and you can select either Red Delicious

519
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:40,559
Empire or Macintosh with this tool

520
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,569
there's a great bud hardiness tool

521
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,659
that's experimental that art de gaetano

522
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:48,000
built and it is based on research out of

523
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:51,779
Washington State and the three varieties

524
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,900
that are available here are conquered

525
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:58,009
Cab Franc and Riesling and again there

526
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:01,410
are these maps that show

527
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:03,869
the modified hardiness temperature here

528
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:06,960
but injury potential obviously there's

529
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:08,539
none right now I access access this very

530
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,670
recently

531
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:14,460
and then this is a chart showing the max

532
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:16,920
men and this is the hardiness line for

533
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,980
Concord and this is the lowest

534
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:23,050
temperature since july one map

535
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,779
this is a this is about as big as these

536
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:28,809
maps get so this is a about the highest

537
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:32,259
res that you'll get of this map on the

538
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:33,339
web right now but art also ardha gaetano

539
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:35,289
with Orton Earth and Atmospheric

540
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:37,240
Sciences he's also the director of the

541
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,250
Northeast Regional Climate Center built

542
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,049
this soil temperature algorithm for us

543
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,809
to estimate this we are going we're

544
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:46,450
planning hopefully to use these data in

545
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:50,609
a weed development model that Tony

546
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:53,200
detomaso Abby semen and

547
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:56,829
I'm having a senior moment is it Mike

548
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,500
Ryan or Mark Ryan I'm Matt thank you

549
00:23:56,829 --> 00:24:03,119
thank you are potentially going to be

550
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:05,559
developing so and if you think about it

551
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,849
soil temperature and knowing soil

552
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:09,399
temperature could potentially be used

553
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:11,669
for planting date estimation for certain

554
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,670
crops

555
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:18,879
this soil temperature map is available

556
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:22,329
right now so this is available if you go

557
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,180
to New Oh cornell.edu and go to crop

558
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:28,149
management it should be in that list if

559
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,500
it's not tell Betsy or Greg who are in

560
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,290
front of day know how to get ahold of me

561
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,539
so

562
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:37,000
anyway um

563
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:38,589
all right moving along so now I'll show

564
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,779
you the couple of tools that are

565
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:42,449
actually programmed in nua for apple

566
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:47,289
this is the apple evapotranspiration

567
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:51,090
model so it's modeling the use of soil

568
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:53,319
water by the orchard so

569
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:55,899
essentially you would select the weather

570
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:57,789
station this screen capture was done

571
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:01,210
last year before we had the state

572
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:03,129
selection in this utility you'd select

573
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:06,370
the date usually it defaults to the

574
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:08,110
current date hit continue and then

575
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:11,259
you're going to put the green tip date

576
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:13,269
will estimate that for you but if you

577
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:15,490
know that for your orchard block you

578
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:17,470
would get better results more accurate

579
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,450
results obviously if you enter that and

580
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,600
then you put your row spacing between

581
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:24,269
row spacing and the trees per acre you

582
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:26,230
can do either or

583
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:28,660
obviously if you know your trees per

584
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:31,670
acre you don't really have to do the row

585
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:34,490
spacing and between row space and then

586
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,560
this is a selection for the age of the

587
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:40,839
orchard I think it goes zero one two

588
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:43,730
three years and then mature and

589
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:45,589
you'll hit calculate I think the

590
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,410
calculate button is usually here under

591
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:51,589
this water balance and the

592
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:55,430
table will build the green row here is

593
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:58,250
the green tip date no it's the current

594
00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:01,789
date I'm sorry wrong model the green row

595
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:05,900
here is the current date in blue are the

596
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:07,940
past dates and in brown are the forecast

597
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,820
days pushed out in this case I think

598
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:13,059
they go six to seven days into the

599
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:15,859
future

600
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:17,929
rainfall right now we can't really get

601
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:20,119
if you've ever looked at a forecast it's

602
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:22,160
usually what are the chances of rain the

603
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,889
percent prediction it doesn't tell you

604
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,160
how much is going to fall so this

605
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:31,280
rainfall will inform how many gallons

606
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,529
per acre have fallen on the orchard how

607
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,389
much irrigation you've applied can be

608
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:39,230
entered here if you have your irrigation

609
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:41,450
record and then the daily water balance

610
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:46,299
in gallons per acre and the cumulative

611
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:49,190
water balance so the perspective is

612
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:52,009
this final number is the number that you

613
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,830
need to be concerned about if the tree

614
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:56,509
has drawn out

615
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:57,970
ten thousand five hundred and twenty six

616
00:26:56,509 --> 00:27:00,559
gallons per acre

617
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:03,250
what you need to do then is to look at

618
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,079
the water holding capacity of your soil

619
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,940
obviously and

620
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:11,899
what they recommend is to start

621
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:14,180
irrigation if you're at if the tree is

622
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,759
drawn off ten percent of that water

623
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:19,450
holding capacity that's their earmark

624
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:21,559
benchmark target

625
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:23,630
so what you would need to do if you've

626
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:26,569
got an irrigated orchard you figure out

627
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:29,570
how much water you're putting out on

628
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:33,319
your acres so the flow rate of the

629
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:35,240
emitters and the number of emitters per

630
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:37,939
acre and you can figure out how much

631
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,849
water you can put on acre and then you

632
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:43,070
use this calculation to do that so that

633
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:45,529
what these guys are going to do so this

634
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:48,829
model has been built by Alan lactose

635
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:51,369
research on Apple physiology Terence

636
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:54,559
Robinson's work with extension and

637
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:58,069
Terrance has a postdoc gel me Lord Don

638
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,559
and this is actually jammies slide so

639
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:02,629
johnny is now working on this and they

640
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,119
hope to develop an actual app with this

641
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:08,420
that where you can put in okay emitters

642
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:11,529
and soil type etc and will improve this

643
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:13,970
model anh nua accordingly the

644
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:15,769
other model that I wanted to walk

645
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,329
through our tool that I wanted to walk

646
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:19,400
through with you today is the apple

647
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:22,789
carbohydrate thinning model this model

648
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:26,240
is perhaps the biggest reason I think

649
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:28,849
why the network has grown so

650
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,180
significantly over the past few years

651
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:35,269
this model has revolutionized thinning

652
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:38,509
in orchards it's no longer okay I'm

653
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:41,690
going to put this much growth regulator

654
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:43,490
out and so there's an ounce of that I'm

655
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,100
going to put that in the tank and then

656
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:48,609
the grower porous himself or herself an

657
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,609
ounce of vodka

658
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:54,889
shut that down and get on there sprayer

659
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:56,779
and they go out and they spray that's

660
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,560
not my joke i borrowed that from dan

661
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:02,629
donahue who works in the hudson valley

662
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:04,700
but it is I mean it just gives you an

663
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:07,460
idea it's almost like voodoo thinning

664
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,529
was like okay has it been cloudy is it

665
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,910
going to be hot what's happening what

666
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:13,849
are the trees like which variety

667
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:16,430
etcetera this model has been phenomenal

668
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:19,219
and again it's built on research by

669
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:22,690
Allen laakso and in tree fruit

670
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:24,920
physiology and work by a number of

671
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:28,490
horticulturalists in the Northeast that

672
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:31,519
have tested this over the years so what

673
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:33,799
you would do you first access the model

674
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,889
and this is just a screenshot showing

675
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:39,259
you how the map is first that shows up

676
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:43,160
you'd select the state the weather

677
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:46,269
station the date and hit continue then

678
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,529
the results tab will start to form and

679
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:50,210
here they're going to ask you to put in

680
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:52,309
a green tip date again we can estimate

681
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:55,880
that for you but it's always better if

682
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:59,240
you have your biological data in hand

683
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,130
the bloom date and then you hit

684
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,200
calculate

685
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:05,600
and

686
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,610
Apple carbohydrate results tabulate and

687
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,639
build

688
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:11,949
so the thinning table builds from me go

689
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,700
back

690
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:18,890
from the green tip date here down very

691
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,200
similar to the irrigation table this

692
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:24,680
green row this is the current date that

693
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,410
you just selected the rows in blue above

694
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,080
are the past history and the rose and

695
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:32,960
brown below are

696
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:34,939
what's forecast into the future and then

697
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,650
the thinning recommendation is in this

698
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,450
column so you're either going to

699
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,490
increase the thinner rate by a certain

700
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:43,460
amount decrease the thinner rate by a

701
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:45,370
certain amount or apply a standard rate

702
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:48,440
and

703
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:52,219
below this the apple carbohydrate

704
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,500
balance charts and builds so what I

705
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,509
usually tell audiences is if you think

706
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,630
about it from the standpoint of being

707
00:30:56,509 --> 00:31:02,569
female and having to carry a baby to

708
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:04,960
term which is very near and dear to my

709
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:08,450
heart because i had twins

710
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,779
you have to eat well you have to have a

711
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:14,200
good carbohydrate balance so if the tree

712
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:16,789
is starving and you put a thinner on

713
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,009
it's probably going to shed a lot of

714
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:21,500
that fruit right because it doesn't it

715
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:24,980
probably wants to drop some of that load

716
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,529
anyway so but it's never as simple as

717
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,539
that as you know because they're plants

718
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:31,389
and there's so much more complex than us

719
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:34,519
humans could ever think of being

720
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:36,920
so if the carbohydrate balance is in

721
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:38,779
surplus the opposite you would think

722
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,910
would hold true right it's going to take

723
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:43,639
more thinner to thin them off but the

724
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:46,670
problem is there's a lag there's a lag

725
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,470
in in the memory of the tree and a lag

726
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:52,340
and all of these processes within the

727
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:56,028
tree so in any case it's made thinning a

728
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:57,949
lot less of a I got to have that shot

729
00:31:56,028 --> 00:32:00,368
before I can get on the tractor and put

730
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,749
that growth regulator out on my orchard

731
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:04,999
so some of the considerations that we

732
00:32:02,749 --> 00:32:07,009
tell people going forward we have to

733
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:09,409
have good solar radiation data from the

734
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:11,358
weather station if it's out of range we

735
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:13,489
will silence the station because we

736
00:32:11,358 --> 00:32:15,618
don't want the garbage in garbage out

737
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:18,200
thing we don't want people to be

738
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:19,878
accessing a model when the data going

739
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,669
into it is bad or could give them

740
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:24,488
erroneous results hard to thin varieties

741
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:26,719
are still going to be hard to thin and

742
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:28,548
obviously people need to use it within

743
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:32,469
the context of the thinning guidelines

744
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:35,358
in the area region state that they're in

745
00:32:32,469 --> 00:32:37,338
so the next section of my talk I'm just

746
00:32:35,358 --> 00:32:40,548
going to talk about how have we built

747
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:41,888
the capacity of nua so clearly the

748
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:44,690
biggest

749
00:32:41,888 --> 00:32:46,128
part in that or the piece of that was

750
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,639
partnering with the Northeast Regional

751
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:51,618
Climate Center they house our database

752
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:53,748
they help us with model programming into

753
00:32:51,618 --> 00:32:55,939
the p.i design tools that people are

754
00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:57,679
creating they help us with some data

755
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,269
quality control they provide

756
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,719
meteorological expertise and guidance

757
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:04,519
which we living in the biological side

758
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:06,950
of things we really don't have a lot of

759
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:08,618
and the nice thing too is that they're

760
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:12,859
interested in agricultural applications

761
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:14,269
of climate data you know if they weren't

762
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:17,388
interested in that it would be a harder

763
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:19,338
sell they have also helped us with

764
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:21,288
automated reports that we wanted to

765
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:23,269
generate to send to people when we know

766
00:33:21,288 --> 00:33:25,098
that their weather station is down and

767
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:27,259
initially when we implemented this I

768
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:29,718
thought oh my gosh everybody's going to

769
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:31,759
be so mad because we're you know

770
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:33,169
hassling them with these emails telling

771
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,868
them their station is down but the

772
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:39,710
reality has been I have gotten more

773
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:41,838
compliments on that then I've gotten

774
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:44,899
anybody saying forget it can you stop

775
00:33:41,838 --> 00:33:47,960
bugging me with this it's just really

776
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:49,908
been a win-win situation these are the

777
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,269
rain wise incorporated weather stations

778
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:55,669
and this is the about weather stations

779
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:58,848
menu there's more to this menu now

780
00:33:55,669 --> 00:34:00,229
because we put together more links for

781
00:33:58,848 --> 00:34:02,648
the troubleshooting guide we have a how

782
00:34:00,229 --> 00:34:05,088
to replace the battery things like that

783
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:08,230
these are solar powered this is the

784
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:10,480
solar panel that powers the instrument

785
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,789
this is a leaf wetness sensor now

786
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,579
they're mounted on the north side over

787
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:18,940
here under the tipping bucket

788
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:24,239
this is the radio antenna the radio the

789
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:27,608
data is radio signal transmitted to a

790
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,829
computer or a box inside the house or

791
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:31,690
barn and we either use the internet

792
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:33,878
protocol the file transfer protocol

793
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,918
we're going to be working on that API

794
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:38,949
that I mentioned earlier for one minute

795
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:41,888
data and then rain wise also has a few

796
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:43,658
products in their premium system I think

797
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:46,840
they have a frost alarm they've

798
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:48,669
developed things like that you can also

799
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,289
send your data to weather underground

800
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:55,719
and other weather service providers

801
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:58,210
so weather stations this is both really

802
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:01,569
exciting for me and almost overwhelming

803
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:05,619
this charts only through I believe July

804
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:08,550
of 2015 I haven't had a chance to

805
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:12,250
upgrade this or update this to include

806
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:14,230
2016 and the end of 2015 but in the last

807
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,000
seven years we've seen significant

808
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:19,539
growth in the number of weather stations

809
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,960
connected to nua because of partnering

810
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:25,389
with all these other states here this

811
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,260
green is when the New Jersey State

812
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:31,089
Climatologist Nets joined up with us the

813
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:34,690
gray is the University of Massachusetts

814
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:39,160
which which I must say we were zero

815
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:41,500
funded in 2010 and I I think a big part

816
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:43,750
of still being here and being relevant

817
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,849
is because at that time Vermont and

818
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:49,000
Massachusetts wanted to join forces with

819
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:51,368
us and and they really helped us

820
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,619
immensely in terms of our funding base

821
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:58,240
and keeping us rolling and going so um

822
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,460
for the airport's for those of you who

823
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:03,309
are who are familiar with weather data

824
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,780
enough to know that the microclimate

825
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:06,519
around that weather station can have a

826
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,410
significant impact on the weather data

827
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:11,170
we do have a relative humidity

828
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:14,379
correction factor for our Airport data

829
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:17,108
and we also have a leaf wetness estimate

830
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,450
for those locations because typically

831
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:21,309
meteorologists are not collecting

832
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:22,889
that type of data they don't have those

833
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:25,659
types of sensors

834
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:27,879
so this is our list of partners it's

835
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:31,359
exciting that this slide is getting more

836
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,910
and more full all the time and I think

837
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,849
probably the most exciting thing for me

838
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:38,230
is that the Minnesota apple growers and

839
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:40,839
the North Carolina apple growers

840
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:43,119
associations are paying for statewide

841
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,920
membership for all of Minnesota and all

842
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,949
of North Carolina and I've asked them

843
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,220
repeatedly are you okay with that what

844
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:54,009
if a vegetable grower

845
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:57,219
Steve put up a weather station are you

846
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:59,650
going to be like what and they said no

847
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:01,629
we're fine with that we're you know

848
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:04,329
that's what we want because we want this

849
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,460
network in our state so it's it's pretty

850
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:08,440
exciting dealing with apple growers that

851
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:11,110
for the most part have shown a great

852
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,559
deal of altruism through nua it's it's

853
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:15,990
been really quite rewarding

854
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:19,119
the new partners that we're currently

855
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:21,219
grooming so to speak enviro weather

856
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,130
which is a similar system to nua that's

857
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:25,719
based out of Michigan State University

858
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,820
we are now currently receiving their

859
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:29,139
data and looking at it to make sure it's

860
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,660
going to be compatible with our new a

861
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:33,309
database and how that collaboration is

862
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:34,989
going to look going forward we're not

863
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:37,719
sure because again they have their own

864
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:39,159
enviro weather and we have new one how

865
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:41,379
are we going to how are we going to

866
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:44,609
share our tools and and whatnot so it's

867
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:48,039
kind of going to be exciting year

868
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:49,990
looking to build that there are Tuesday

869
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:52,059
climatologist Nets one is in North

870
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:54,519
Carolina and one is in Delaware that

871
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:56,519
I've been in communication with trying

872
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:59,409
to enrich our network with their data

873
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:02,619
New York State mesonet has put up I

874
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:04,989
believe 125 or 150 state-of-the-art

875
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:09,210
weather instruments all across New York

876
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:14,409
and these were in response to

877
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:17,139
Lee and Sandy that devastated the coast

878
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:19,059
and up into the Hudson Valley so these

879
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:21,099
are FEMA dollars that are paying for

880
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:23,110
this network to go into New York so

881
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:27,089
we're working with them to see about

882
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:29,010
getting that set into nua we are

883
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:31,440
partnering with climate smart farming

884
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:34,700
and seeing where you know how can we

885
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:38,099
collaborate with them and we've just

886
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:41,609
embarked on a product I or a what is

887
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:43,920
that you know a beta test of getting

888
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:46,110
data to the University of Maine so that

889
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,450
they can run some of our data through

890
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,519
their a grade our models so that should

891
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:52,799
be exciting

892
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:56,309
what are our stakeholder priorities so

893
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,320
top priority sustainable funding yes

894
00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:01,679
sustainable funding I know many of you

895
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,260
know how important that is we'd like to

896
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:06,059
have a responsive web design so that if

897
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,950
you're on a smartphone Noah is going to

898
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:10,110
behave a little easier you won't be

899
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:12,899
pinching and pulling we'd love to have

900
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:14,700
more stations we have looked into using

901
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,490
the National Digital forecast database

902
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:18,779
of gridded data

903
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:20,909
there are some issues with that most

904
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,090
notably leaf wetness for all the plant

905
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:26,519
pathology models

906
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:28,470
looking at developing apps alerts the

907
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,809
growers would very much like for us to

908
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:32,759
remember their planting dates and their

909
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:34,289
green tip dates and their bloom dates so

910
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,260
they don't have to have a little cheat

911
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:39,739
sheet and enter it every time that they

912
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,400
use the model more models more tools

913
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:44,159
station maintenance and troubleshooting

914
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,369
we've done quite a bit of that on that

915
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:49,399
the past two years and promoting

916
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:52,019
awareness which is why I'm here

917
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,750
we held a planning meeting so there's a

918
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:56,429
state coordinator for every state that's

919
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,989
part of nua and at the time we had our

920
00:39:56,429 --> 00:40:00,899
planning meeting there were six state

921
00:39:57,989 --> 00:40:03,329
members of nua and again they wanted

922
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,309
responsive our objectives when after our

923
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:08,009
meeting we came away with responsive web

924
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:10,549
design a set of premium products to

925
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:12,780
build some sustainable funding

926
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:15,960
virtual stations that's using that

927
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:19,380
digital database and wouldn't it be nice

928
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,599
to have a developer sandbox so Greg you

929
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,670
could go in there

930
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:26,309
Apple Paul and youth

931
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:29,309
open papal pollen tube growth model here

932
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:31,949
we go let's test it out and so a

933
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:34,639
developer could go in set up some

934
00:40:31,949 --> 00:40:37,278
parameters put in some language

935
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:39,139
it go and the tool would be created on

936
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:41,239
the fly and then you'd have this tool

937
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:45,018
that you could validate and change and

938
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:47,328
implement blueSky thinking I know I know

939
00:40:45,018 --> 00:40:51,229
the people who know me are all like

940
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:56,809
Julie really okay all right so coming

941
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:59,539
down to earth so um having gotten older

942
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:01,609
and just having gotten a smartphone

943
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:04,130
which I used to hide my flip-flop

944
00:41:01,608 --> 00:41:06,170
football when I was out talking to

945
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,700
growers because you know they knew i was

946
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:13,210
doing Nuala and I've been doing a lot of

947
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:16,750
other like digital computer stuff and

948
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:19,400
so I did I got a smartphone and

949
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:21,579
Steve valentino who was working for me

950
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,318
he's just gone on to grad school

951
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:27,318
in

952
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:29,869
you know molecular biotechnology stuff

953
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:32,630
you know medicine that's very compelling

954
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:33,910
area but when he was working for me he

955
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:37,298
was doing all the troubleshooting

956
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:40,608
weather station maintenance stuff

957
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:43,730
and he said well Julie I don't even

958
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:46,159
worry about if it opens into another tab

959
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:48,019
I just keep all the you know on my

960
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:50,088
browser on my phone I keep all these

961
00:41:48,018 --> 00:41:52,818
things open and so then I have all these

962
00:41:50,088 --> 00:41:55,568
tiles and I can just go up down group

963
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:55,568
and I went oh

964
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:03,919
so what I did was I did that and I took

965
00:42:01,278 --> 00:42:06,980
a picture of my phone and so here you

966
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,170
this is a picture of my phone and so

967
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,210
I've got the urine nua is a blog that we

968
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:12,259
set up because i was told Julia gotta

969
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,880
set up a blog you've got to get a

970
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:17,449
twitter account he's got to do all his

971
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,608
facebook okay and so I've got the degree

972
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:22,038
day calculator the Apple disease models

973
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:25,699
and the new a homepage on my browser all

974
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:28,440
the time and you just hit reload and Mel

975
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:30,269
reload

976
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,559
so anyway I mean for some of you it's

977
00:42:30,269 --> 00:42:36,449
like yeah I knew that right

978
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:38,460
so what have you been doing in terms of

979
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:40,019
just weather data research so I

980
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,619
mentioned about the soil temperature

981
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:46,318
estimates those this year I believe they

982
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:48,059
put out actual sensors in specific soils

983
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,449
they wanted to use to validate that

984
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:53,039
estimate so that's ongoing

985
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:55,019
there's some precipitation solar

986
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,670
radiation temperature and humidity data

987
00:42:55,019 --> 00:43:01,858
quality control research that's ongoing

988
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:04,789
we've been trying to get funding to get

989
00:43:01,858 --> 00:43:07,440
the gridded data developed and

990
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:10,380
there's another grant that's that's

991
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,088
going to go in that I'm part of so

992
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,579
hopefully Noah would benefit from that

993
00:43:12,088 --> 00:43:16,529
and then we did some work on leaf

994
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:20,430
wetness estimation and found that an

995
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:23,700
hour with relative humidity above ninety

996
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:26,578
percent would be a good enough estimate

997
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:27,929
we did you know so that's kind of just a

998
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:31,170
little ballpark of what we're using

999
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:33,419
right now and some of the research that

1000
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:35,519
we've done so in terms of model

1001
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,338
development there's the apple pollen

1002
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:41,460
tube growth model this is another

1003
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:44,489
thinning model essentially but it's a

1004
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,980
value to organic producers who would be

1005
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:48,598
applying lime sulfur Greg correct me if

1006
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,869
I'm wrong okay so they'd be applying

1007
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,099
lime sulfur too thin off blossoms so

1008
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:55,500
they're gonna they're trying to kill the

1009
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:56,660
blossom but you don't want to kill the

1010
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,239
blossom

1011
00:43:56,659 --> 00:44:03,088
unless the fruit has set or it's at a

1012
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:06,269
vulnerable stage to be killed so that's

1013
00:44:03,088 --> 00:44:10,559
where I rely on people like keithy odor

1014
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:13,380
at Virginia Tech and greg peck to to

1015
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:15,239
inform this so we're excited about this

1016
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,460
and we're hoping we might be able to get

1017
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:18,979
some funding to develop this model here

1018
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:21,869
in the near term

1019
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,519
Tony detomaso and soil and crop Sciences

1020
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:26,010
I mentioned is looking at a weed

1021
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:28,289
management model betsy lamb whose in

1022
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:30,060
this room got a grant from New York farm

1023
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:32,809
viability Institute to develop woody

1024
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:34,980
ornamental insect degree day tools and

1025
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:38,949
the New York berry Growers Association

1026
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:41,590
funded us develops some very insect and

1027
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:43,480
disease models and essentially you've

1028
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,940
got a wish list of over 40 models maybe

1029
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:49,059
it's only 38 now maybe maybe we maybe we

1030
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:51,369
did two of these this past year so just

1031
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:53,079
quickly some impacts and outcomes so

1032
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:55,599
Noah is transforming this weather data

1033
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:58,299
into knowledge you know it's just it's

1034
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,159
helping the grower farmers can share all

1035
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,230
this weather data through the cloud and

1036
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,359
we now have forecasts that are pushing

1037
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:07,269
things out five days making it an actual

1038
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:09,250
actual forecast so some of the things

1039
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:11,889
growers are saying i use the newest site

1040
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:14,650
almost every day early in the season the

1041
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:16,779
orchard was largely scab free so apple

1042
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:18,730
scab is a disease for the first time in

1043
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,670
several years the manager relied heavily

1044
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:23,289
on noah and to new jersey apple growers

1045
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:26,470
reported the best thinning results ever

1046
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:29,289
in 2015 using the apple carbohydrate

1047
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:31,959
thinning model so better i p.m. reduce

1048
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:34,809
pesticide use and yes people growth

1049
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,909
regulators are pesticides reduce

1050
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:38,889
pesticide use improved environmental

1051
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:41,460
protection better crop management

1052
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:45,730
improved crop quality improved yield

1053
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:47,170
enhanced decision support so the chart

1054
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,849
now you guys aren't really that

1055
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:50,920
concerned about this chart this just

1056
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:54,429
says yeah growers agree or strongly

1057
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:56,860
agree that noah helps ipm reduce sprays

1058
00:45:54,429 --> 00:45:59,679
improve spray timing alert pest risk and

1059
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:01,690
enhance I p.m. this was before we

1060
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,399
launched our new website so this was

1061
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:05,610
when even when we were on the clunky old

1062
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,200
website today

1063
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:10,780
we're Bennett we're experiencing over

1064
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:12,849
two million pageviews per year now a

1065
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:18,330
page view is when the end user is

1066
00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:18,329
spending 30 minutes or more on a page

1067
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,640
back at seven growers reported they

1068
00:46:23,139 --> 00:46:26,469
could save on average and these are

1069
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:27,569
primarily apple and grape growers on

1070
00:46:26,469 --> 00:46:30,569
average

1071
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,980
19500 per year it costs and prevent

1072
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:35,100
about a quarter of a million per year in

1073
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:38,199
crop loss so again high-value

1074
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:39,610
horticultural crops and when we asked

1075
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:42,449
would you recommend nua to farmers

1076
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:46,300
ninety-nine percent said yes they would

1077
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:48,639
so Noah access to IPM decision support

1078
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,830
an IPM is all about sustainable

1079
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,449
management of pests using methods that

1080
00:46:50,829 --> 00:46:55,239
minimize environmental health and

1081
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:57,639
economic risks so we're taking plant

1082
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:59,199
disease epidemiology research insect

1083
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:01,329
phenology research plant phenology

1084
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:04,419
research and crop management research

1085
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:06,909
and we're creating phenology models and

1086
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:09,460
forecasts that benefit the end user

1087
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:11,170
they're benefitting the grower I think

1088
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:13,990
we're doing a pretty good job in fruit

1089
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:17,680
and vegetables we could do better in

1090
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:20,859
ornamentals betsy's lining the you know

1091
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:22,179
yellow brick road on that one and you

1092
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:25,380
know we'll see where the future is in

1093
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:29,769
terms of field crops and livestock

1094
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:32,320
so I think with that I will say thank

1095
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:35,219
you for your attention and I'll take any

1096
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,220
questions you might have

1097
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:41,699
