00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,439
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,439
university

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,638
okay we'll get started well thank you

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,279
very much again to the

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,960
cornell seat conference committee and to

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,239
you allen for inviting me to speak today

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,480
i'm very

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,919
proud and privileged to do this i'm very

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,560
passionate about this

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,519
particular topic and have had the great

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,559
fortune of

12
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,118
being able to immerse myself from both

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,678
science

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,519
and technical perspective in this area

15
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,399
of sea technology and i hope to share a

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,160
little bit with that

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,960
today with you my contact information

18
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,119
i'm sure this will be shared

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,280
down the road with anybody with the

20
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,878
information from the presentation

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
but feel free to reach out at any

22
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,079
particular time with any

23
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,718
additional thoughts or questions that

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,840
come up uh from this presentation

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,120
or just say hey what if that question we

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,039
get them all the time

27
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,799
and we like to make sure that uh i

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,840
certainly can point in the right

29
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,839
direction of

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,719
what may be helpful for individuals with

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,880
questions around seek technology

32
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,158
so to give you an overview of what i'd

33
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,000
like to cover today

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,520
and it's a broad topic and i know we

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,478
have a broad audience

36
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,438
uh attending the conference today and

37
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,000
i'm hoping to

38
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,158
uh focus on getting a common ground

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,799
baseline of what the coding world is all

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,960
about

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,880
and what these look like from vegetables

42
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,639
all the way to variable crops

43
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:33,438
and i i hope that is very clear and the

44
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,359
areas around these technologies that are

45
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,639
available to all of us

46
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,959
and then we're going to spend some time

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,599
talking about the key features of coated

48
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,239
seed

49
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,039
and i use the word coated to represent

50
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,959
the full

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,320
range of seed technologies that are

52
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,599
applied to seed

53
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,959
and we'll explain on that a little

54
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:55,438
deeper we'll then go into

55
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,118
the types of coatings used today we'll

56
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,438
talk about

57
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,438
those features that are involved the

58
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,879
equipment that's used for these coatings

59
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,559
we'll talk about that

60
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,560
and then finally get into the heart of

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,439
the matter of seed treatment challenges

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,920
and issues and solutions around some of

63
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,959
these

64
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,079
particular scenarios that take place

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,520
out in the real world

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,000
so to set the stage in the morning

67
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,920
session

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,199
you would have heard from alan and alan

69
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,079
would have spent quite a bit of time

70
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,958
talking about

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,239
processing and the and the implications

72
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,920
and selections and

73
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,239
various uh complexities around

74
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,039
processing we're going to spend our time

75
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,599
today's book

76
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,759
speaking around this green shaded area

77
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:43,199
which is the treatment or

78
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,919
selection of multiple multiple of

79
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,679
uh various options and inputs that

80
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,359
companies can put on to seed and in

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,080
particular we're going to focus in one

82
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
area

83
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,840
around coding and film coding coding in

84
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,759
general

85
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,360
uh the whole world of pelleting and

86
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,318
crusting and film coding or seed

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,879
treatment

88
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,598
in particular there are a number of

89
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,158
areas that

90
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,919
get involved in this treatment sphere

91
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,479
from enhancing

92
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,919
priming steeping pre-germination depends

93
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,799
on what type of seed you're working with

94
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,359
in these areas

95
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,760
upgrading in particular we're not going

96
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,519
to spend time about that

97
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,359
certainly there are other inputs that

98
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,439
are into the treatment world that we

99
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,239
will be talking about which are the

100
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,959
traditional fungicides insecticides uh

101
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,878
other

102
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,039
other products are applied to seed those

103
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,719
are quite important for us to discuss

104
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,318
and understand they're being applied to

105
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,318
seed in a certain way

106
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,079
but along the way we're very concerned

107
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:36,399
about quality and you'll hear this theme

108
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,360
of

109
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
quality uh throughout the conversation

110
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,400
today

111
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,318
and the presentation as to a major

112
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,799
concern that we will have and talk about

113
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,798
as we

114
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,400
go forward so to set the stage the

115
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,040
family of coatings and i thought

116
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,879
a descriptive and pictorial uh

117
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,639
description of these families are quite

118
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,399
helpful this is onion seed

119
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,798
that has been film coated with a seed

120
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,680
treatment on the left here the blue that

121
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,040
you see

122
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,959
and then in the middle is the black

123
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,840
onion seed itself and on the left is a

124
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,400
mini pellet

125
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,560
or encrusting white colored and the

126
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,000
green on the right which is also mini

127
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,920
pelleted encrusted

128
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,319
version of a coating on that seed and

129
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,959
then finally we get into pelleting

130
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,918
of that particular seed and and here you

131
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,600
have the full

132
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:26,000
range of seed technology for a species

133
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
in this case onion ranging from film

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,360
coating

135
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
through mini pelleting on crusting up to

136
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
a full pellet

137
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,360
now not every seed crop is utilizing

138
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,079
these technologies to fold in the full

139
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,120
gamut

140
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,159
vegetables tend to be more utilized in

141
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,720
this area

142
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,680
uh broadacre crops corn soybean

143
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,120
traditionally tend

144
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
to be just in the film coding seed

145
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,720
treatment area of the family of products

146
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,160
this gives you a a broad view of the

147
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,880
opportunities

148
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,320
of applying safe technology to seed from

149
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,719
a coating perspective

150
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,918
and within these coatings additions of

151
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,600
value can be added

152
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,680
particularly treatment and other

153
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,520
beneficials can be added to these

154
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,519
coatings that you want to put on to see

155
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
so what are the advantages why do we do

156
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:15,198
this well seed handling is a

157
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,519
very uh major uh input

158
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,360
on this area of sea coatings we're

159
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,839
taking something that could be irregular

160
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,680
size and shape and make it uniform

161
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,359
we might want to take small seed and

162
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,879
build it up in size to make it more

163
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,360
marketable

164
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,478
growers are able to plant coated seed in

165
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,840
various machinery

166
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:36,639
much easier coatings improve

167
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,638
flow ability both in the in the actual

168
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,079
seed plant and in the planter box itself

169
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,319
the growers use

170
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,599
and we can increase the seed by weight

171
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,000
to improve

172
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,000
air seeding by plane and then we also

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,038
have a health and safety factor around

174
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,279
coated seed

175
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,639
that it's around worker safety handling

176
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,399
of the seed itself

177
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,720
is is quite important in making sure

178
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,839
that what we put on seed stays on seed

179
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,840
and doesn't get airborne

180
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,039
cultural practices um very large for

181
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,279
certainly the vegetable industry around

182
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,959
coatings without a lot of coatings that

183
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,758
go on to seed it wouldn't be possible to

184
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,839
plant

185
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,439
as uniformly in these fields namely

186
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,399
vegetables direct seeded crops in

187
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,279
particular

188
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,638
lettuce comes to mind immediately sugar

189
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,198
beet of course is another one that's

190
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,038
used

191
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,960
quite heavily and we'll talk about that

192
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,360
crop a bit further

193
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,279
but by space planting we're able to take

194
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,600
care of the normal agronomic

195
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,959
uh conveniences that we all like to talk

196
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,680
about in other words

197
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,719
competition moisture nutrients the

198
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,639
sunlight

199
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,479
availability for the plants to compete

200
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,800
in a normal environment

201
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,560
less stress overall and when you have

202
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,199
less stress you tend to get better

203
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,720
plants

204
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,800
better plants tend to leave to be better

205
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,039
yields and then finally

206
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,800
with the planting perspective we get a

207
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,318
prescriptive seed treatment so we're

208
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,120
starting to see prescriptive seed

209
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,039
treatments

210
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,879
come into play by region in other words

211
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,439
if we have hot spots for

212
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,879
pneumaticide nematodes we can fight the

213
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,199
lava sites on the seed

214
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,918
and we can have an impact in a regional

215
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,280
area that

216
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,560
may not be so um such the case in other

217
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,679
areas or parts of

218
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,439
the geographic planting territory that's

219
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,519
going to be used the same crop

220
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,279
so it really becomes prescriptive and

221
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,359
we're seeing more and more of this as we

222
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,359
move forward and see technology

223
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,520
and we really like what we're seeing

224
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,319
here from the application of treatments

225
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,758
onto seed

226
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,759
as a descriptive element

227
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,560
where companies and particular

228
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,879
professionals like to get into ball with

229
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,240
advantages of coatings on seed and the

230
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,839
benefits

231
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,240
one of them comes immediately to mine is

232
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:43,679
branding being able to

233
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,960
brand a color or a look or

234
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,240
some sort of uh effect around that seed

235
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,719
that identifies the end user with that

236
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,519
treatment or with that application on

237
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,599
seed

238
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,519
and we do see quite a bit of this people

239
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,399
like colors they like the way it looks

240
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,598
in the bag

241
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,959
they like the way the seed appears it

242
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,918
provides a lot of

243
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:09,120
perspective from the end user and the

244
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,120
perceptions of quality

245
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,559
there's also an opportunity to do

246
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,120
bolt-on applications

247
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,519
uh with these value additions so you

248
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,598
might have a seat treatment platform

249
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,198
and you can have a biological platform

250
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,878
and all these can be bolted onto the

251
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,879
seat at various levels within the

252
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,319
particular coding application

253
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,160
and this is becoming more and more

254
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,399
popular as you have these different

255
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,399
uh opportunities to uh by the bolt-ons

256
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,958
and that leads into the differentiation

257
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,839
by our region allows us to do that very

258
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,879
flexibly

259
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,919
flexible uh from the pers perception of

260
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,519
having

261
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,600
end users do that there might be a

262
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,320
downstream co-op that's doing

263
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,839
uh seed treatment and they can be very

264
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,360
flexible about what they're putting on

265
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,200
seed based upon the region

266
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,039
and the differentiation they're trying

267
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,680
to do

268
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,519
the other benefit is uh companies taking

269
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,278
non-saleable seed let's say they have a

270
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,039
seed lock that's too small

271
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,958
and they want to make it a little larger

272
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,319
to make it saleable so it plants better

273
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,679
for the end user

274
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
that's where you might employ some

275
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:13,039
interesting technology to be able to

276
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,000
uh build that seed up and provide the

277
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,599
benefit

278
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,039
of that particular coating or treatment

279
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,879
on seeds

280
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,319
uh of course future additions we've

281
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,200
talked about that

282
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,920
it allows the platform to put those onto

283
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,240
seed

284
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,519
uh with these coatings and then it's a

285
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,720
quality platform

286
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,240
for the end user it just gives the right

287
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,920
look and like feel of what we're trying

288
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,919
to do and

289
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,759
all these built-in benefits that

290
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,639
provided by code and seed

291
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,720
really do add up in the end for the end

292
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,559
user

293
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,720
when we start to move into quality and

294
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,359
this is probably one of the largest

295
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,519
areas

296
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,519
within the subject matter that we could

297
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,799
spend a lot of time talking about each

298
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,600
of these areas

299
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,319
and really they they fall into these

300
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,240
major

301
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,399
categories dust off flow ability

302
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,759
plantability seed safety build up and

303
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,399
appearance

304
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,399
we'll start off with dust off dust off

305
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,159
is a major concern

306
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,919
whatever we put on to seed we want to

307
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,480
ensure that that is staying

308
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,759
on the scene we don't want that being

309
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,519
airborne

310
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:21,919
during the planting process or from a

311
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,360
perception of having materials in the

312
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,360
air when

313
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
seed is being treated at the actual seed

314
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,159
plant for worker safety

315
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,079
we want these products to stay on seed

316
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:35,199
there is technology to allow us to

317
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:37,759
test i'm using a hoibot dust meter

318
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,600
uh this is a european machine that

319
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,360
measures the amount of dust coming off

320
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,159
seat in the controlled

321
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,278
test the european c union have employed

322
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,559
this technology

323
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,958
to guide them in a guidance of what seed

324
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,439
must

325
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,399
meet in terms of a minimum level of dust

326
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,240
off

327
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,799
in the north american market we haven't

328
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,039
quite got there with a minimum

329
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,159
required dust off level but we do tend

330
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,480
to follow the european

331
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,838
lead um with their standards that they

332
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,000
have before

333
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,120
this toy box dust meter not everybody

334
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,839
has one there are certain

335
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,039
a number of third-party laboratories out

336
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,399
in the industry that does

337
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,719
sgs immediately comes to mind they offer

338
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,600
dust off testing services and you can

339
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,278
send seed in

340
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,360
or have it tested and they they will

341
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,559
certainly do that many of the large

342
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
companies will have these in their

343
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,958
laboratories for testing

344
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
products as a very common quality

345
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:32,559
control parameter

346
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,839
flow ability flow ability is really

347
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,479
measuring

348
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,600
in two aspects we can have wet flow and

349
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,519
dry flow

350
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,360
wet flow is coming straight out of the

351
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,360
treater

352
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,519
no carrying no drying nothing just

353
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,200
simply the product leading the treater

354
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,600
and we measure flow ability

355
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,759
that's probably the worst case scenario

356
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,159
of how the seat will perform

357
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,679
downstream and then we get into a dry

358
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,078
flow ability where the seed has been

359
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,120
allowed

360
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,239
to cure that it's it's either 24 hours

361
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,240
after treatment

362
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,159
it's in the bag we're going to take a

363
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,480
sample and measure flow ability

364
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,439
and there is technology to measure flow

365
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,680
ability

366
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,959
you'll see a picture in a little bit of

367
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,799
what that is

368
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,559
that falls into plantability

369
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,319
plantability can be done

370
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,159
using a plantar test stand there are a

371
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,079
number of companies that have these

372
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,600
for third-party testing and also many

373
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,679
companies having themselves

374
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,519
again testing the plantability of the

375
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,519
coated seed to ensure that we aren't

376
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,240
causing any problems

377
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,078
with the planting function of that

378
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,519
particular seed species and the coating

379
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,159
within it

380
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,519
seed safety the number one thing is do

381
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,519
no harm

382
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,039
whatever we put on seed no matter what

383
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,000
it is from the film coat all the way up

384
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,480
to a pellet

385
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,159
we must do no harm to the seed and in

386
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,839
the early days of coatings there were

387
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,600
times where harm was had

388
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,360
and i can tell you from first-hand

389
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,000
experiences that

390
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,440
those are not fun to deal with in

391
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,519
particular when you have

392
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,519
issues in the field based upon the

393
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,159
coding that did not perform as it should

394
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,639
have

395
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,000
but we've learned over the years of what

396
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,440
best practice

397
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,320
application technology materials

398
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,959
all this experience has really uh come

399
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,600
into play

400
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,078
where uh seat safety are basic table

401
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,639
stakes

402
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,679
they just they just are there as part of

403
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,000
what's expected

404
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,439
that seat is expected to perform it's

405
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,120
but inspected to germinate

406
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,639
in a wide range of environmental

407
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,000
conditions and

408
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:31,120
should also uh be able to to

409
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,278
withstand storage over time and have no

410
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,320
no harm done to it as well with any type

411
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,159
of coating on it

412
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,320
now there are some limitations when you

413
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,958
do some special enhancing like

414
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
priming for instance priming will over

415
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,159
time

416
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,000
the the lifespan or storage of that seed

417
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,120
will diminish over time

418
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,600
it's not to say these things are

419
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,679
bulletproof but we do need to be ensure

420
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,759
that we're keeping up with storage as a

421
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,359
commercial saleable product for the

422
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,198
marketplace and we're doing no harm in

423
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,079
that area

424
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,399
the next item is build up this is a

425
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,638
build

426
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:07,278
up of coding material on equipment

427
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,000
basically it's sticking and leaving a

428
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,399
residue

429
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and that buildup occurs over the course

430
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,399
of the treatment cycle

431
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,198
whether that's all day long or for an

432
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,559
hour or

433
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:20,559
four weeks if you're not cleaning down

434
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,799
and this can be a real troublesome

435
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,439
problem this buildup can be

436
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,078
really an issue downstream we can get

437
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,399
flakes

438
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,239
of coating coming off during the

439
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,879
transfer of seed from one

440
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,639
location to another and these build up

441
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,559
flakes or coating chunks can ultimately

442
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,159
end up in the bag or the box

443
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,479
or whatever packaging material we're

444
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,039
using and that ultimately ends up in the

445
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,800
planter

446
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:47,439
and that that causes major issues

447
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,319
you've got plugging of various planter

448
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,320
equipment

449
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,240
and they'll get skips or you get

450
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,360
problems and it just is a headache for

451
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,360
everybody and we just

452
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,360
want to avoid those and there are some

453
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,399
things we can prescriptively do to avoid

454
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,440
build up

455
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,839
and then finally at least but not uh not

456
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,240
nearly

457
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,279
a a bottom feeder here this is

458
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,320
appearance

459
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:10,639
appearance is really a quality effect

460
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,160
um and in the old days we were simply

461
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,399
coloring seeds

462
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,879
uh and trying to get some some effort of

463
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,000
color on there to meet this federal uh

464
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:22,078
seed act for for uh seed treatment

465
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,519
but nowadays appearances we can make

466
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,719
these scenes look

467
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,879
so glossy and flashy and and

468
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,720
really have a wonderful look to them

469
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,278
they almost look like uh

470
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,759
pearls or candy coated uh materials that

471
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,559
we would

472
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,560
enjoy this appearance area has really

473
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,958
come a long long ways and there's a

474
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,399
number of elements that can go into

475
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,599
appearance to try and

476
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,559
uh spruce things up and give a good look

477
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,079
from that perspective so quality these

478
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,838
are the key items that

479
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,799
we commonly focus in on these six main

480
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,199
topics

481
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,359
so dust off to give you some perspective

482
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,359
of dust off and to try and put

483
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,440
some numbers in perspective we truly

484
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,320
traditionally measure dust off in grams

485
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,040
of dust

486
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,079
per hundred thousand seeds the eu has a

487
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,399
level of 0.75 grams per hundred thousand

488
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,278
uh those are very small numbers and

489
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,519
certainly uh

490
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,759
hard to understand if you're not looking

491
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,759
at them in comparison to something

492
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,120
uh when you look at actives alone they

493
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,839
traditionally if you're just being

494
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,000
active on with no polymer that those

495
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,959
actives will have a higher dust off

496
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,679
score

497
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,638
uh than a they see treated with a

498
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,758
polymer

499
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,680
uh in a traditional film code and that's

500
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,199
not to say all polymers are the same

501
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,319
here you can see that we've got two

502
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:39,758
different polymers

503
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,440
and two different dust results from

504
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,199
those particular polymers

505
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,519
and the reason this occurs is polymers

506
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,758
have what we call a binding capacity

507
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,679
and that binding capacity related to how

508
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,320
much it can hold

509
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,198
on to the seed when it is cured and

510
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,720
fully dried

511
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,799
don't close we'll talk a little bit

512
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,680
later create a fish net

513
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,519
on the seed binding on products onto

514
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,838
that particular seed and we can

515
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,120
over stretch that and go too far and

516
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,600
they just simply won't have the

517
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,159
capability to hold on to those products

518
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,918
beyond its binding capacity in this case

519
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,319
you're seeing that effect here between

520
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,839
what we call polymer a and polymer b

521
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,599
with the same active

522
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,599
loading amount on the seat

523
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,079
this is flow ability uh the flow meter

524
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,720
you see on the right there is a

525
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,678
traditional

526
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,880
flow meter you can load in a kilo of

527
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,480
seed

528
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,480
set the gate to open for x number of

529
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,599
minutes or seconds or whatever you wish

530
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,360
to measure

531
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,719
and the gate will pop open you can

532
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,879
measure the flow

533
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,798
and you can examine what happens after

534
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,080
that particular point of time

535
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:49,279
in this case this is wheat looking at

536
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:52,000
flow ability in minutes and obviously we

537
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,480
want a lower number if we possibly can

538
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,880
and coatings can help in the flow

539
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,880
ability and improving the flow ability

540
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,640
over just actives by themselves this

541
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,840
isn't to say actives are not doing a

542
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,880
good job they're doing what they're

543
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,199
supposed to do

544
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,559
but many times actives when they are

545
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,400
dried on seeds

546
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:09,678
they can create a little bit of a grit

547
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,559
and that grit can cause

548
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,120
some resistance and flow ability when

549
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,678
you put a coating on it can smooth that

550
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,519
surface of the seed and and get that

551
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,559
flow moving a little quicker

552
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,319
raw seed itself or naked seed that

553
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,798
usually flows the best and that is

554
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,720
usually the conservative standard of

555
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:29,679
measuring flow is the actual raw seat

556
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,480
itself

557
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,240
so flow ability easy to test there is

558
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,720
technology out there and equipment to

559
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,759
use

560
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,919
to measure flow ability and

561
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,919
and you can get a very good sense of how

562
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,640
these particular products can perform

563
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,360
from both a

564
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,640
wet perspective and a dry perspective so

565
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,079
wet seed

566
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,679
flow right out of the treater we can put

567
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,199
it in the flow meter and measure it and

568
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,798
you can wait 24 hours

569
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
measure the same seed and look at the

570
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,839
difference and you will see differences

571
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,480
in those wet and dry flows

572
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,959
plantability plantability this is from a

573
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,000
planner

574
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,319
test stand looking at singulation you

575
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,919
can look at skips doubles placement

576
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,399
there's a number of things you can do

577
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:14,000
across a variety of seed

578
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,798
sizes uh and and seed plates this is

579
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,960
corn

580
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,000
and using a john deere system and we're

581
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,440
looking for

582
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,679
a very consistent uh singulation across

583
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,080
all c types in this particular planner

584
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,480
stand and we're achieving that here

585
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,639
you can get a lot of great readouts from

586
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,640
plant monitors

587
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,160
that are out there in the industry and a

588
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,799
number of companies have them

589
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
for their quality assurance testing but

590
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:39,200
again

591
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,558
something we want to look at as we're

592
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,240
looking at coated seed to make sure

593
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,440
we're not impacting these areas of

594
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,240
plantability

595
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,200
we want to do obviously do no no no

596
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,200
additional

597
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,840
problems in the plantability of a coated

598
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,840
seed hitting the planter itself

599
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,319
seed safety germination this is a

600
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,559
something that we all are very concerned

601
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,000
about from day one with any coating on

602
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,240
seed

603
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,079
we want to always be looking at the

604
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,679
untreated seed against the actives and

605
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,558
then against the coatings that may

606
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,840
be going on and we do this at times zero

607
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,119
we might spread this out

608
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:20,798
uh at time three months six months

609
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,798
12 months 18 months two years and

610
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,519
some of those tests take actually two

611
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,599
years to run so we've got this real time

612
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,038
environment of seed being stored and

613
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,639
running these tests to make sure we do

614
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:32,158
no harm

615
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,679
in this case you're getting a snapshot

616
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,559
here in this graph of just a period of

617
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,280
time

618
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,798
uh looking at untreated the actives an

619
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,079
actress plus a polymer

620
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:41,918
and then an accuracy plus another

621
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,678
polymer in the light blue they're really

622
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,720
looking at the green and the light blue

623
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,320
uh effects of the coating and what

624
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,640
happens and here you're looking at

625
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,720
a warm dream result a cold germ result

626
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,120
and an accelerated aging result

627
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,798
three common tests that might be run for

628
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,678
corn in particular maybe

629
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,519
other crops um but these will be run

630
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,080
over a period of time to ensure that we

631
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:07,200
aren't doing any harm to the seat itself

632
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,879
during that storage period of time and

633
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,640
it's quite important we have all the

634
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,440
controls in place to be able to measure

635
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,759
these

636
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,558
and do them in a proper way from the

637
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,079
seed safety perspective so

638
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:22,558
very very important i can't

639
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,558
underestimate the effect of seed safety

640
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,240
so now we've gone through quality we've

641
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,558
looked at the family of coated products

642
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,440
i want to take a look at what's really

643
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,119
in front of us

644
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,279
in terms of uh industries

645
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,558
and if we look at the two basic

646
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,759
industries we're talking about bread

647
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,079
acre crops

648
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,759
that's the group up here on the left and

649
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,038
vegetables in the right there's some in

650
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,038
between

651
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,400
we're all expecting the various

652
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,798
performance levels

653
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,440
uh of quality within these crops but

654
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,319
there are

655
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,159
some very different expectations and

656
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:59,200
very different scenarios

657
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,360
in real world with these crops within

658
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,360
the vegetable industry they're small

659
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,479
small batches and i say small fallen

660
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,439
relative to what

661
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,720
broadacre crops may experience and

662
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,880
traditionally

663
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,720
seed seed value at the vegetable

664
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,200
industry has been much higher in terms

665
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,440
of

666
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,440
per pound the pound of tomato seed

667
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,840
versus a pound of

668
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,679
corn seed two different complete

669
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,839
dichotomy areas

670
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,880
within that the vegetable industry has

671
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,119
had some very

672
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,640
sophisticated equipment for handling

673
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,439
these small batches

674
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,960
from coatings to upgrading to doing very

675
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,159
specialized

676
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,279
processes to that seed to to allow

677
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,679
things to occur

678
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,960
in particular in in the seed treatment

679
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,840
seed coating area

680
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,880
there's been a lot of advances of these

681
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,599
areas

682
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,159
and handling seed ensuring that the seed

683
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,719
is

684
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,760
treated with the ultimate idea of

685
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,038
quality measuring

686
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,440
moisture and humidity and and processed

687
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:57,200
teas

688
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,038
after that coating process to ensure

689
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,400
that the seed is in its premier

690
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,558
condition the

691
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,640
opposite of that is the prodigal crop

692
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,279
sector there we've

693
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,960
had to because of the large volume of

694
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,918
seed that we're dealing with

695
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,679
there we've had to employ very large

696
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,720
capacity

697
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,200
seed coating seed treating applications

698
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,720
in many instances there's just no way

699
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,080
around it because we have to

700
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,880
get that amount of seed through the

701
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:29,759
system in order to meet demands and

702
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,120
the quantity of seed that's required um

703
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,440
so we have

704
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,359
in this area within this space of

705
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,720
predict the crops we do have some

706
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:41,918
very good seed treatment technology very

707
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,919
high level but

708
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,038
a little lower level on the actual

709
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,960
equipment side

710
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,038
when you reverse that the vegetable size

711
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,600
you have a very high level of equipment

712
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,200
but a very low level of seed treatment

713
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,119
sophistication in terms of the products

714
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,880
available for the vegetable industry

715
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,439
and that just goes to the size of the

716
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,919
markets and where the value is placed

717
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,720
in terms of acres and expenditure within

718
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,480
the

719
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,159
large agrochemical companies and what

720
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
products they're bringing to marketplace

721
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,679
so it's not a surprise to anybody but

722
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,319
there are these two

723
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,519
distinct differences in terms of how

724
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,759
these

725
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,679
crops are handled and what equipment is

726
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,200
used within each sector

727
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,960
there's a little bit of bleeding

728
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,640
occurring today of

729
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,440
one into the other and we're starting to

730
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,320
see more of the vegetable side mentality

731
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,798
entering into the producer crop side and

732
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,798
that's

733
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,400
very welcomed and you'll see why that's

734
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,558
occurring when we start talking about

735
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,159
issues and solutions

736
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,720
people have learned how to handle

737
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,200
various applications in the vegetable

738
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,798
side

739
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,240
and that's now starting to creep over

740
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,400
into the part of the crop

741
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,000
so it's quite interesting but i thought

742
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,120
this gives a pretty good perspective

743
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,119
of uh what we're up against so

744
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,879
to really break down these coatings and

745
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,000
we'll focus on this one in particular

746
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,799
film coating this is

747
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,839
onion and and the center picture here

748
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,759
you can see that we have

749
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:02,558
uh the onion seed itself and a red layer

750
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,240
of the

751
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,720
seed treatment and the blue layer of the

752
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,640
color and these can be layered on if

753
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,319
we have the ability to use multiple

754
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,360
pumps or they could be all slurried on

755
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,079
at one time

756
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:16,000
it really is just dependent upon what

757
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,079
technology the individual has for siege

758
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,798
treatment

759
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,240
if you look at the various uh crops that

760
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:23,759
are film coded and here you're seeing

761
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,720
some pictures of that

762
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,200
pop up on your screen you know we've got

763
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,759
some

764
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,558
carrots and tomato and various things

765
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,798
like that

766
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:35,359
brassica here on the left and then we

767
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,839
get into corn on the right

768
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:38,719
film coating is used across almost all

769
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,079
crops

770
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,679
and it does a great job of encapsulating

771
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:47,119
the treatment on the seed

772
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,159
and the seed size is still recognizable

773
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,359
you can still see

774
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,360
what the seed actually is

775
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,959
so film coating versus seed treating

776
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,359
today we

777
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,360
incorporate a polymer into the slurry

778
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,879
around the application

779
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,798
of the treatment going on seed dust off

780
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,360
is the result of reduction

781
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:09,038
is the result of using that polymer when

782
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,079
we use a polymer it's classified as a

783
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,240
film code

784
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,359
if we're not using a polymer as we did

785
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,960
many many years ago

786
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,199
it was just seed treatment and that was

787
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,640
pretty much done in a in a cement mix or

788
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,720
some other type of rotating

789
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,679
vessel and we just threw in the

790
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,159
treatment and

791
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,159
whatever stuck it stuck but nowadays

792
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,559
with the advances of polymers

793
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,080
and and slurries and active ingredients

794
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,480
we can make a very

795
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:34,079
nice package that goes on the seed and

796
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,720
we can apply it

797
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,038
and with that polymer and that will cure

798
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,120
and as that said before a fish net

799
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,240
kind of effect around the seed and

800
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,599
allows it to

801
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,839
hold the active ingredients on that seed

802
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,798
within the vegetable industry one big

803
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,678
difference that

804
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,119
is is very important to recognize and

805
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,278
there is a drying step

806
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,798
closed film coating or any type of

807
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:57,759
coating for that matter on the vegetable

808
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:59,679
side

809
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,440
that drying step has always been there

810
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,200
in the industry because of the packaging

811
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,960
requirements of managing

812
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,519
humidity and moisture within those

813
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,159
particular seed crops

814
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,960
for the vatican crops typically in the

815
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,840
past

816
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,360
no drying has been done there are

817
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,639
instances where people are employing

818
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,918
that technology now

819
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,880
and we'll talk about why that's

820
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,278
happening but it typically has not been

821
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,799
done um but now we're starting to see

822
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,240
more of that so we wanted to make sure

823
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,000
we pulled out that

824
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,319
little nugget to to ensure you

825
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,278
understand that these differences occur

826
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:35,439
within vegetable

827
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,880
and vital crops so we're seeing this the

828
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,600
shift

829
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,760
of this technology we talked about this

830
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,879
high level sophistication and vegetables

831
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,079
low-level treatment

832
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,640
and vice versa on the uh variety of the

833
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,960
crops

834
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,360
and we're being demanded to do more and

835
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,919
more the variety of the crop sector

836
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,398
is being asked to put more on the seed

837
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,919
and there is a limitation of geography

838
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:59,038
space on the seed of what we can

839
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,120
actually put on

840
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,879
and not cause ourselves problems

841
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:06,719
downstream at the treatment

842
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,440
process and and those those certainly um

843
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,360
can occur as we move into the next

844
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,038
sector and diving a little deeper in

845
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,519
encrusting and pelleting

846
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,240
uh this is more traditionally been used

847
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,278
in the

848
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,278
vegetable and protected glass culture

849
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,599
industries and here we're looking for

850
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:26,720
singulation we want to be able to

851
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:29,278
we want to be able to plant perfectly

852
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,600
in the field or in the greenhouse every

853
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,880
seed counts and every seed has to grow

854
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,119
every seed needs to be placed

855
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,559
exactly where it needs to go and and

856
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,599
traditionally this has also

857
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:41,918
been very much adapted by the the uh the

858
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,918
vegetable or horticultural industry

859
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,520
um starting to bleed over a little bit

860
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,960
into some particle crops with this

861
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,720
encrusting technology

862
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,319
but in general it's been have been

863
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,600
focused in this this area of the

864
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,639
industries

865
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,398
um encrusting traditionally 10 to 30

866
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,399
build up by weight dependent upon seed

867
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,918
species a drying step

868
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,000
post impression is done because we're

869
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,159
adding a lot of moisture to be able to

870
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,640
build that seed up by weight

871
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,360
the seed shape remains visible the edges

872
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,919
are smooth

873
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,278
we can precise load on chemicals or

874
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,840
other value-added products

875
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,640
desktop is minimalized we have seed

876
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,839
handling

877
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,600
copper books box float

878
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,158
advantages and we have very attractive

879
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,678
products so encrusting offers a lot of

880
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,120
opportunity

881
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,440
for doing a number of different

882
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:30,558
technologies on seed

883
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,278
that pull us in a direction that allows

884
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,200
us these values

885
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,519
here you can see some some drilling

886
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,798
equipment and the photo on the right

887
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,119
shows an encrusted product on a seed

888
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:42,798
wheel

889
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,239
a vacuum wheel it just shows you the

890
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,079
precision that we're going to get

891
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,839
from this that vacuum is going to pull

892
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,199
up into each individual seed

893
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,759
it's going to put it down in the ground

894
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,558
exactly where we want it it avoids

895
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,919
the whole issue of doubles and skips and

896
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,278
whatnot

897
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,600
done by this so pelleting as we finish

898
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,119
up

899
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:04,480
last of the of the family of coatings

900
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,879
pelleting is the roundest of all

901
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,319
products it is uh

902
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,799
the seed shape is unrecognizable and

903
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,079
the build up by a weight can go as much

904
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,639
as two to eight

905
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,240
times depending on the species and that

906
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,200
80 is traditionally in

907
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,679
small very small seeded products like

908
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,120
tobacco or flowers for instance

909
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,720
there are some very large abilities to

910
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,918
take place

911
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,600
sometimes there's a multiple of sizes of

912
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,919
coating or pellets

913
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,119
within a particular species sugar beet

914
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,440
comes to mind

915
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,479
depending on the size of the raw seed

916
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,440
there's been

917
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,519
a a movement of having a specific pellet

918
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,120
type for each size of seed

919
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,278
and that's been employed in that

920
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,918
particular market sector

921
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,440
in areas within lettuce there's

922
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,200
opportunities for

923
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,798
a couple different industries sizes of

924
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,919
lettuce seed as well from the coated

925
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,038
pelleted side

926
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,799
uh in that industry a drying step is

927
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:01,759
done here as well we have to dry seed

928
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,960
down

929
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:07,119
we have to take out that moisture i want

930
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,519
to make sure we get a good cure

931
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,119
on that pollen that's done we want to

932
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,240
ensure that we don't have any

933
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,359
issues of the seed cracking or flaking

934
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,480
or breaking off

935
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:20,959
during the particular processes in the

936
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,440
facility that's being done

937
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,038
we're able to load precisely uh

938
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,919
chemicals onto pellets

939
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,759
and in fact there is uh quite a bit of

940
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,679
layering that goes on

941
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,839
we have the ability to load vast amounts

942
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,320
of seat treatment onto

943
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,038
these areas these coatings and we can

944
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,519
move them out

945
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:41,278
the outside of the seat and that allows

946
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,679
some good advantages

947
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:48,319
to target agronomic issues in the field

948
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,679
by getting higher loads of uh seat

949
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,960
treatments onto

950
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,559
pellets it does uh does make a nice

951
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,000
opportunity of layering them away from

952
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,158
the seed some of them

953
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
can be a little phyto-toxic to see and

954
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,559
by layering away we can remove some of

955
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,798
those

956
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,240
uh negative effects from there we can

957
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,319
add nutrients and

958
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,278
other additives to the the coating

959
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:09,839
materials

960
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:12,720
uh give benefits to the seed obviously

961
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,959
ease of planting is a

962
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,839
stake there involved and attractive

963
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,360
products attractive products themselves

964
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:24,720
allow for us to have a multiple of

965
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:27,359
color schemes that can be used matte

966
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,360
versus shine there's a number of

967
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,319
different opportunities within

968
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,759
hello world we can do to give ourselves

969
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,558
some attractive

970
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,558
looking products

971
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,119
so to give you a perspective of what

972
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,000
these look like and it's always nice to

973
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,158
have some photos

974
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,919
this is sugar beet that you see there

975
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,880
and the blue pellets that have

976
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,080
shown up on the right sugar beet was one

977
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,399
of the uh

978
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,319
first crops to be pelleted back in the

979
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:57,119
1940s

980
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,879
my former employer jermaine started that

981
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:02,000
with a material supplier

982
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,320
and um the whole movement was to try and

983
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,798
get

984
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,558
uh seed planting or space planting in

985
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:07,679
the field to get the the prop of the

986
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,519
sugar beet to

987
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,278
compete at a favorable ability

988
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,079
and so sugar beet is certainly one of

989
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:20,079
the world's largest

990
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:22,879
coated seeds from a culling perspective

991
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:24,720
then you get into brassicas and carrots

992
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,440
and celery chicory into that leek onion

993
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,558
pepper

994
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,200
of course let us mention before

995
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,839
tobacco flowers tomato they're all used

996
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,798
in this

997
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,678
cooking area as well flowers very very

998
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,639
small seed

999
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,559
that takes extreme art and skill from

1000
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,720
the operator to coat these seeds

1001
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,678
almost like flecks of pepper that are

1002
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,640
being coated

1003
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,840
and they can singulate one seed in a

1004
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,480
pellet

1005
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,720
of these particular small seeded species

1006
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,599
in the flower range

1007
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,600
here's a range of

1008
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,960
raw and coated products from your left

1009
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,600
to your right

1010
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,319
on your left you have carrots the next

1011
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:05,278
is

1012
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,000
fennel and then onion and lettuce and

1013
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:07,519
tomato

1014
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,760
and then a flower couldn't tell you what

1015
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,838
flower that is but as a flower seed

1016
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,839
and it's quite quite interesting to see

1017
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:16,159
what these look like and how they

1018
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,320
they migrate from the raw version to the

1019
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,639
pelleted version

1020
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,119
we then also have the ability to do

1021
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,320
unique things within the pelleting range

1022
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,240
uh not saying this is employed across uh

1023
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,960
all crops but certainly we're seeing

1024
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,719
this also more into the grass

1025
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,398
coatings that are taking place grass

1026
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,239
coatings are more of encrusting

1027
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:39,199
but they're starting to utilize some

1028
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,918
technologies to manipulate inhibition

1029
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,598
and we have some hydroscopic agents for

1030
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,239
slowing inhibition

1031
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,000
where we're vulnerable to water damage

1032
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,199
in cold wet conditions or cold

1033
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,079
chillage injury issues and we can slow

1034
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,199
the water

1035
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,599
from inviting the seed quickly with

1036
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,639
certain coatings then we have

1037
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,119
hydroscopic

1038
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,000
coatings or wetting agents and this is

1039
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,480
to

1040
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,199
speed the water uptake or create some

1041
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,000
sort of a

1042
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,919
gel around the seed and this is where

1043
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,400
the grass industry is starting to

1044
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,960
show some improvements in this area of

1045
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,200
having seeds

1046
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,960
attract the water and creating this sort

1047
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,838
of a gel and i have some pictures here

1048
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,920
to show you

1049
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:23,440
um down the bottom in this petri dish is

1050
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,079
a see as grassy

1051
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,760
coated with a material that will form a

1052
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,440
gel when it gets wet

1053
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,680
and that gel is water activated

1054
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,880
and you can imagine in some arid

1055
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,358
locations where the

1056
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,720
water is not predictable that this

1057
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:41,838
offers the opportunity

1058
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,439
uh for the seed to um experience some

1059
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,039
some water that it normally wouldn't

1060
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,679
have and these uh

1061
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:50,239
hygroscopic or wetting agents do perform

1062
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:53,679
and do perform quite nicely

1063
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:56,639
the other area is splitting coats

1064
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:58,559
and splitcoat has been around as a trade

1065
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,039
name for a number of years

1066
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,039
from a company called incotec back in

1067
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:07,119
the day it was royal sluice

1068
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:09,358
and uh the split coat allows for

1069
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,358
the cracking of the coat to open up and

1070
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,199
expose the seed to light

1071
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,639
and there are some phenomenons to take

1072
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,279
place um

1073
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:20,078
with uh with light a light seeing

1074
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,160
requirement of seeds namely lettuce

1075
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,920
in order to germinate natural defense

1076
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,960
mechanism if it doesn't seem light

1077
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,800
it won't germinate in this case

1078
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,320
we can employ the splitting technology

1079
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,200
of the coat to allow the

1080
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,519
light to get in and it will overcome

1081
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,399
that

1082
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,280
photo dormancy you can see on the right

1083
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,838
how that split

1084
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,040
basically just cuts right in half of

1085
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,759
that seed type

1086
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,119
and it really does do remarkably well

1087
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,560
and there's a number of these products

1088
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,240
on the marketplace today

1089
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,239
that allow the splitting to take place

1090
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,240
um rapid melting or melting or

1091
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,199
sort of the disintegration of the

1092
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,519
coating

1093
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,559
very important for certain industries i

1094
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:04,159
want to draw this out

1095
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:06,799
there are these coatings available um

1096
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,078
a lot of flour tobacco companies are

1097
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,480
utilizing this technology

1098
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,920
because they want the seed to release

1099
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,920
immediately out of this this

1100
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,680
coating if i click the mouse here you're

1101
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,760
going to see what happens to the coating

1102
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,199
you can see on the right the red pellets

1103
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,680
starting to disintegrate as they

1104
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:22,559
experience some water and here they are

1105
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,358
completely

1106
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,880
uh disintegrated and completely gone

1107
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:28,319
within seconds

1108
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,000
and it's quite amazing how these

1109
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,280
coatings work in this area

1110
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,838
and allow for us to uh prescribe this

1111
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,160
this

1112
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:38,320
opportunity and economics for the seed

1113
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:42,159
to be exposed very quickly to

1114
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,160
the planting environment

1115
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,719
so how do we get these materials on seed

1116
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,000
and there's a number of

1117
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,199
pieces of equipment that are being

1118
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,960
utilized i'm going to walk you through

1119
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,960
some older technology all the way up to

1120
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,838
what we use in a modern day

1121
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,240
seed treatment application this is what

1122
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,599
we call a spouted bed this is a for film

1123
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,439
coating

1124
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,119
how this works is we load a batch of

1125
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,000
seed in this vessel

1126
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,480
and then we fluidize the seed by pushing

1127
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,480
dry

1128
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,240
air up through the bottom of this

1129
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,199
particular cone

1130
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,000
and then we inject using a spray nozzle

1131
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:21,118
the

1132
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,159
seed treatment slurry and binders and

1133
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,200
pigments

1134
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:28,719
and the seed sort of tumbles and mum and

1135
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,559
moves around in this cone and

1136
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:33,118
the air is exhausted through the top and

1137
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,519
captured and abated

1138
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,838
this type of equipment is very early

1139
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,480
early day equipment for film coding

1140
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:42,960
um you can immediately see that the uh

1141
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,440
the batch capacity would be limited

1142
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,199
and that your capacity per hour will be

1143
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,119
quite slow

1144
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,719
it does do an effective job what it does

1145
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,039
so well is it dries during

1146
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:53,919
coats and so you can get some layering

1147
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,880
if you are so

1148
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,760
so sophisticated with your setup but it

1149
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,559
does provide

1150
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,040
a nice a nice way of getting that seed

1151
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,838
treatment

1152
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,838
onto the seed using a spouted bed

1153
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,358
the next uh piece of equipment that's

1154
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:11,759
utilized

1155
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,000
and you still might find these today is

1156
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,680
a side vented coating pan and this is a

1157
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,599
technology taken straight out of the

1158
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:19,118
pharmaceutical industry this is how

1159
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,000
tablets are made

1160
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,480
and this again is a batch process and

1161
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,440
there's a

1162
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,240
there's a spray boom arm that you see

1163
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,559
and i'll

1164
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,759
hold it up a little coat closer for you

1165
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,400
this spray boom

1166
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,240
has multiple spray heads on it where

1167
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,440
each individual stray head could be

1168
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,838
a different ingredient and it allows

1169
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,679
uh for these materials to be sprayed

1170
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:44,880
onto the seed and controlled

1171
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:47,199
either all the one or one by themselves

1172
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,800
great flexibility for application of

1173
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,960
materials onto seed

1174
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,400
and the other unique thing about this is

1175
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,519
the drum rotates

1176
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,720
and the seat inside tumbles but the

1177
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:01,199
drama itself is perforated and we push

1178
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,239
drying air through the drum and we can

1179
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,719
actually

1180
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,719
control the air in terms of the amount

1181
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:08,559
of humidity that's in that air

1182
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,078
with these systems and does a very

1183
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:13,039
effective job

1184
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,440
of drying the seed now this is batch to

1185
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:16,159
batch

1186
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,760
coating so you have to load the seed in

1187
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:21,039
do the tree in an application but

1188
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,160
unload the seed and it can be fairly

1189
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,079
cumbersome

1190
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:26,000
to get a good amount of throughput

1191
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,880
through but you still will find these in

1192
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
the industry

1193
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,358
um this equipment was uh it can be and

1194
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,199
is expensive

1195
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,199
um pulling from the pharmaceutical

1196
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:37,358
industry you can imagine that

1197
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,719
might be a little bit more costly than

1198
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:40,559
some of today's

1199
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,118
seed related equipment that's used for

1200
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,119
seed treatment

1201
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,359
this next set of equipment for film

1202
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:53,199
coating seed treatment

1203
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:56,239
high volume continuous treaters these

1204
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,838
these are very common you'll find a

1205
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,239
number of these out in the

1206
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:00,880
field at various levels within seat

1207
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:04,000
companies

1208
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,400
downstream dealers cooperatives it just

1209
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,440
as a matter of where you look you'll

1210
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,760
find these

1211
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,880
these are rotating drums typically have

1212
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,920
some sort of inlet

1213
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,640
on top that allows for the seed to to go

1214
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,039
through

1215
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,799
in a controlled manner it's pretty much

1216
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:19,358
free flow you can throttle down the

1217
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,160
inlet

1218
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,519
a little bit but it does open wide up

1219
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:25,279
and just move through you have an

1220
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,759
atomizer that is

1221
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,720
atomizing the liquids onto the seed and

1222
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,839
then the seed

1223
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,279
enters into the rotating drum and that

1224
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:36,078
drama is turning

1225
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,640
and that drum by turning allows the seed

1226
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,359
to

1227
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,879
rub up against each other and by adhe

1228
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,679
and cohesion

1229
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,079
that treatment is pulled on and off each

1230
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,598
other

1231
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,200
and by the time you're done getting

1232
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,039
through the bottom of that drum

1233
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,279
you basically coated the entire seed

1234
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,759
with a particular product

1235
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,720
these are are very very common come in

1236
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,440
different uh

1237
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,719
lengths and different inlet mechanisms

1238
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,358
you can even add

1239
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:03,679
dry powder applicators to these units to

1240
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:05,759
to apply powders to them if we're

1241
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,719
dealing with some issues

1242
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,160
of attack or wanting to improve the

1243
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,879
appearance or shine

1244
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,879
those powder feeders are employed these

1245
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,160
days in a number of applications

1246
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,838
and we'll talk a little bit about some

1247
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,598
of the pros and cons about that we'll go

1248
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:21,679
a little deeper in the presentation

1249
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,519
but again high volume continuous

1250
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:25,118
treaters here that you're looking at

1251
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,838
many different model leads exist in the

1252
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,838
marketplace

1253
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,640
for pelting it's it's really down to uh

1254
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,680
pan coating

1255
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:38,318
that that's where we were uh for a

1256
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:40,799
number of years and still used today

1257
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:41,920
um these these pans really come from the

1258
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,280
confection

1259
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,280
industry where we're coating like nuts

1260
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,359
or seeds with chocolates or

1261
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,720
any other type of material or seasonings

1262
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,559
that go on to seed

1263
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:54,159
the pan coating has really been around

1264
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,039
for a number of years

1265
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,000
we've adapted it to seeds for pelleting

1266
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,559
technology

1267
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,199
there's different sizes of pans there's

1268
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:03,358
uh

1269
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:04,559
round ones which we call ball mills or

1270
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:07,039
cylinder types

1271
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,799
some flat pans there's a number of

1272
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,400
different of geometric shapes of these

1273
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,039
pants but they essentially do the same

1274
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,358
thing

1275
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:15,599
they get the seed to cascade and then

1276
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:19,119
the cascading effect we're able to

1277
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:22,720
allow seeds to be coated

1278
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,680
by the operator and this technology more

1279
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:25,598
than any other

1280
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:26,960
compelling perspective requires a

1281
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,800
skilled individual

1282
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,960
and that is an art form as much as it is

1283
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,560
a science and these individuals that are

1284
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,559
doing this type of work

1285
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,078
are very skilled very seasoned and have

1286
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,559
a number of years

1287
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,160
of experience in doing this technology

1288
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,880
you can automate this

1289
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,920
uh there's been a number of uh companies

1290
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,680
that have done that

1291
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,440
and the automation does work but you

1292
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:49,118
have to have the right seed species the

1293
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,880
right materials to do that

1294
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,039
very difficult to automate coating like

1295
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,559
tobacco or flowers for instance

1296
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,000
that really has to be done by skilled

1297
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,000
operators with the right configurations

1298
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,000
and finally we end up with rotary coders

1299
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,839
rotary coders are

1300
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,400
our batch treaters that we see today

1301
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,119
very common a lot of c companies have

1302
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,960
these

1303
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,800
we've got a spinning disc on the bottom

1304
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,240
that moves the seat centrifugally around

1305
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,920
the drum

1306
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,719
and then we have an atomizer disc where

1307
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,159
the liquids are put onto

1308
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:21,039
the the benefits behind a rotary coating

1309
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,559
is that

1310
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,559
you can use this technology for

1311
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:25,838
encrusting a pellet by adding powder

1312
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,480
feeders

1313
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,599
and it allows for a lot of flexibility

1314
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,079
from

1315
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,559
film coating seed treatment all the way

1316
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,359
through the crust and repellent

1317
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:37,599
the technology is widely adapted across

1318
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:40,639
a

1319
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,559
vast number of species uh i wouldn't say

1320
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:43,440
you could you could pellet tobacco in

1321
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:45,759
here from a from

1322
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,800
starting from the raw seed you might be

1323
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,480
able to pellet or

1324
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,160
finish tobacco seeds in here as they're

1325
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,559
pelleting through the process

1326
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:53,440
but certain seed species obviously

1327
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,078
wouldn't be

1328
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,960
advisable to do but certainly for a lot

1329
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,200
of vegetables

1330
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,639
all the way up to varico crops widely

1331
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:03,679
adaptable

1332
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:06,318
piece of equipment to use have a little

1333
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:07,199
video to show here from a graphical

1334
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:09,599
point of view

1335
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,279
you can see the seed entering here in

1336
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,960
this demonstration

1337
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,880
and we're injecting liquids and then

1338
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,519
powders are being injected to coat

1339
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,280
onto the seed and that's the basic

1340
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,480
premise of this takes place during a

1341
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,119
batch coder

1342
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,240
uh is that we're able to control each of

1343
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,160
these inputs

1344
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:27,679
when we want them and for how long we

1345
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:31,279
want them to achieve

1346
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:32,719
the process and by uh using batch coders

1347
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,000
it's relatively a fast

1348
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:38,078
process that's taking place in these

1349
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,920
drums because the seat is moving at such

1350
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,400
rapid pace

1351
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,318
it is a very quick application in a

1352
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,720
number of areas

1353
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:48,480
again high capacity output continuous

1354
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:50,318
batch so the batch drops in

1355
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,079
we coat we eject it next batch is

1356
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:52,480
already dropping in and we just keep

1357
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,880
going

1358
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,719
until we run out of seed very highly

1359
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,440
highly effective products and technology

1360
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:59,118
in this area

1361
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,960
there's a number of manufacturers that

1362
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,400
make these equipments in different sizes

1363
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,480
from small lab

1364
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:08,559
size uh piece of equipment all the way

1365
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:13,599
up to full-size production units

1366
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:16,000
okay now we'll take a a dive into

1367
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,519
sea treating issues with the last 10 or

1368
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,559
so minutes we have here

1369
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:21,920
to talk about some of the issues and

1370
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:23,440
some of the things that we're looking

1371
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,079
for

1372
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,358
when delivering quality and we have a

1373
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,200
high pressure

1374
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:30,719
at all levels no matter if you're in

1375
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:33,679
vegetables or bright crops

1376
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:34,480
we must deliver quality and that quality

1377
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:37,039
starts with

1378
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,800
seed treatment that's going on the seed

1379
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:41,440
and that has to do with seed

1380
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,160
loading in other words what we put on

1381
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,960
the seed

1382
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:45,598
we want to ensure we have two things

1383
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,800
that we have

1384
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,599
bulk loading and seed to seed loading

1385
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,560
and that all ties back to recovery in

1386
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,880
other words

1387
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,239
whatever we're going to put on in terms

1388
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,720
of the application rate

1389
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,000
of the seed treatment we want to ensure

1390
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:02,559
that every single seed

1391
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
is getting what it needs from the exact

1392
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,279
dose rate

1393
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,318
so we could treat a batch of seeds and

1394
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,800
we could have a sample of that seed and

1395
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:14,000
we could

1396
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,680
test it for its recovery or bulk loading

1397
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,079
it could come back just fine we just

1398
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:20,960
happened to sample the area that had

1399
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:23,119
the amount of product on the seed if we

1400
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,838
took another sample of that batch

1401
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,640
where it did not get the correct amount

1402
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:28,639
of loading

1403
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:30,159
our seed to seed loading would show that

1404
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,078
difference

1405
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,920
we want to ensure when we are treating

1406
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,599
seed that we have two things not only do

1407
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,240
we have c to seed loading

1408
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,760
but we also have bulk loading so no

1409
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,078
matter what sample we take

1410
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,040
we're ensuring that we are getting that

1411
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,359
recovery of

1412
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:48,239
a product on seed there are a number of

1413
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:51,519
laboratories that can do that testing

1414
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:54,159
of recovery testing and you know

1415
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:55,280
it's very very common to do in today's

1416
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,558
world

1417
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:02,240
from all different sectors within the uh

1418
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,079
agronomic markets you see treatments

1419
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,639
now the demand for better looking seed

1420
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,519
that is not stock that is continuing to

1421
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:09,838
push

1422
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:12,000
uh the envelope we've got uh you know

1423
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:13,279
these perfectly looking pearlescent

1424
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
seeds nowadays

1425
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,440
and that just equates to quality in

1426
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,599
people's minds

1427
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,760
and that's a very high high level of

1428
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,000
a requirement and we can get ourselves

1429
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,839
in trouble very quickly

1430
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,358
by trying to achieve some of those looks

1431
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:32,799
if we aren't careful

1432
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:35,119
and some of those can be disastrous

1433
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,119
and some of them can be very successful

1434
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,800
but those disastrous ones are mainly due

1435
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,400
to coverage issues

1436
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,559
and within the slurries that we're

1437
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,400
utilizing non-compatible products

1438
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,079
that fight against each other that we

1439
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,720
don't uh seem to get the

1440
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,000
appropriate look we're looking for and

1441
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,159
that occurs

1442
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,760
very many times and that we tend not to

1443
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,759
do our due diligence when working with

1444
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,520
coatings and recipes

1445
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,079
and doing our testing to ensure that

1446
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:02,400
that is not the case

1447
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,160
the the introduction of insecticides

1448
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,240
nomadicized biological or bile

1449
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:07,598
stimulants they all have an impact on

1450
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:09,838
appearance

1451
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:12,160
um each product has its own special

1452
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:14,239
formulation each product has its own

1453
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,920
amount of inert of ingredients whether

1454
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,199
it be active or a nurse

1455
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,079
and they can help or detract from the

1456
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:22,318
appearance

1457
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,839
of the final product that is being uh

1458
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,199
produced from the particular seed

1459
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:28,239
treatment plant

1460
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:30,000
and it's it's really a again down to

1461
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,558
testing that recipe and making

1462
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,838
sure that what we do is get providing

1463
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,599
the appropriate look

1464
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,358
and that's starting in the lab and then

1465
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,318
scaling it up and then getting into

1466
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:41,199
production with it

1467
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:43,199
as we move forward and we've mentioned

1468
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,960
many many times about the product crop

1469
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,439
challenge of how much can be loaded onto

1470
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,960
seed and that's an issue because once we

1471
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,679
go too far

1472
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,159
we become too wet and we create all

1473
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:56,239
sorts of issues for us downstream

1474
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:58,000
that relate not only to build up but

1475
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:00,799
appearance issues

1476
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
and we have flow issues that occur as

1477
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,359
well with this

1478
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,920
challenge of eating too much on seed

1479
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,679
for vegetables where we've got that

1480
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,079
drying step in there so it really

1481
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:14,000
doesn't become too much of an issue

1482
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,599
we can overdo it of course in in the

1483
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,358
treating equipment but

1484
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,280
um with that drying step we tend to

1485
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:21,358
alleviate most of those problems

1486
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,519
with vertical crops we just don't have

1487
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:24,000
that and so that's uh you know something

1488
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,000
that

1489
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,679
we really want to make sure we're

1490
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,639
looking at

1491
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,399
here's a a a great example on the right

1492
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:33,199
hand side this is looking down the the

1493
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,519
barrel of

1494
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:37,039
a seed treatment continuous treater and

1495
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:39,838
you can see the chunks of

1496
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,119
material that were pulled out and that's

1497
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:44,960
over a period of time

1498
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:48,240
that this this built up and this buildup

1499
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:52,240
was the cause of attack or

1500
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:54,558
cure time lack of and over treating

1501
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:56,000
and it ultimately resolved itself as

1502
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,800
being a calibration issue

1503
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,239
with pumps and that was being having too

1504
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,559
much material applied

1505
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,000
during the sea treatment process these

1506
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,880
flakes were flaking off

1507
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,079
not this big size um but smaller

1508
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,720
versions of this

1509
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,000
and getting into uh the downstream

1510
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,639
product and into the bag

1511
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,119
product uh going down to the road big

1512
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:17,118
issue

1513
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,039
big problem and we'll talk a little bit

1514
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,760
about how to kind of cure that

1515
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:22,480
so build up caused by attack cure flakes

1516
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,760
recoveries

1517
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,318
all those issues are around build up

1518
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,880
appearance when we start having too uh

1519
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,480
too much

1520
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,480
liquid or too much product going on we

1521
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,920
create these things called moon craters

1522
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,559
or golf ball dimples

1523
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,559
that's a relational issue to coverage

1524
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,400
which flows over into the flow ability

1525
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,800
whether it be wet or dry

1526
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,838
and plantability so everything relates

1527
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,640
back to

1528
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:47,358
um ensuring that our recipe is dialed in

1529
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:48,960
for our

1530
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:50,639
our treatment that we're going to do or

1531
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,240
coding that we're going to do we don't

1532
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:53,118
want to accentuate any problems

1533
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:55,279
downstream

1534
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,920
because they they multiply and they

1535
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,559
become large like you see here

1536
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,559
in the building

1537
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:09,039
so to tackle build up and tack uh

1538
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:10,639
we'll talk about drying and that drying

1539
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:12,558
can be

1540
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:14,000
imparted in a number of ways can be done

1541
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,240
with an actual dryer

1542
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,838
it can be air time or some sort of

1543
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:21,118
curing time

1544
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:22,799
a lot of facilities on various crops

1545
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,480
just have a very small footprint they

1546
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,200
can't put in a lot of equipment

1547
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,679
around their seed treater we want to

1548
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:30,318
have

1549
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:32,318
no restrictions on capacity issues want

1550
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:34,480
to be energy efficient and be simple

1551
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,440
and there's some some new technologies

1552
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,000
that we can impart

1553
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,720
in today's world to try and incorporate

1554
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,760
some air time some drying around this

1555
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:46,078
um in these uh photos you see here

1556
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,880
there's three different uh strategies

1557
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,839
being employed

1558
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,920
in the various opportunities what you

1559
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:53,838
see on the left is a rotary fluid bed

1560
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,838
dryer

1561
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:57,440
not the big blue item but the one on the

1562
00:52:55,838 --> 00:53:00,000
left the gray item

1563
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,679
the gray unit is a rotary drum that has

1564
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,719
air being going through it the seed

1565
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,639
rotates

1566
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:05,759
uh through it and moves through at a

1567
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,400
very rapid

1568
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,599
pace and that rotary fluidization is

1569
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,200
very effective

1570
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,760
of curing or drying the seed and

1571
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:15,598
creating not the buildup issues that we

1572
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,079
can get downstream

1573
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,800
drying belts are another avenue of

1574
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,318
utilizing

1575
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:25,599
um uh drying technology to

1576
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:27,920
eliminate buildup issues of such

1577
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,000
uh fluid fluidized bed dryers again

1578
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,159
another opportunity

1579
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,159
to utilize there's a number of

1580
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:35,519
technologies now coming through into the

1581
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:38,000
product air space

1582
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:39,920
that allow us to attack some of these

1583
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,519
issues that we have

1584
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,920
a lot of times we've tried to solve them

1585
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:46,239
with powders or drying powders

1586
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,079
and and those are while good to achieve

1587
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:50,479
maybe the initial effect

1588
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,519
the long range effect of that may not be

1589
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,599
so good

1590
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,440
and uh from that perspective if you've

1591
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,240
been in a facility that's using dry

1592
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,318
powders

1593
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:59,759
as part of the treatment process they do

1594
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,679
become airborne

1595
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,319
they get on equipment the floor becomes

1596
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:06,239
slick people can slip themselves

1597
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:07,599
there's dust issues there's just a whole

1598
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:10,879
host of things that can

1599
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:13,920
happen with powders that go on seed

1600
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,039
as a drying aid and something that you

1601
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,159
want to consider

1602
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,920
maybe trying to abate if we can by using

1603
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:20,558
technology i realize we can't all do

1604
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,720
that

1605
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,079
uh given the certain footprints that we

1606
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,039
have but there are avenues that are

1607
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,440
coming out

1608
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:29,759
and other potential mechanisms to deal

1609
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,760
with that

1610
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,480
air time probably the biggest thing that

1611
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,039
we can we can give ourselves when we're

1612
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,318
treating

1613
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:40,558
is air time and this is a very common

1614
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:42,639
box to box seed treater this is a very

1615
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,040
rapid seed treatment application

1616
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:46,400
you put a box of a pro box of raw seed

1617
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:49,599
on top of this unit

1618
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,119
flip it on the liquids are injected

1619
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,119
through the atomizer as the seed is

1620
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,200
passing through the auger

1621
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,640
the auger then moves the seed treats

1622
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:58,239
into the next box

1623
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:00,480
so in this scenario you can see that

1624
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:04,078
there's very little air time

1625
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:06,240
and if you try to impart too much

1626
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,240
seed treatment and you have conditions

1627
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,598
of temperature and humidity that don't

1628
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:11,679
line up

1629
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,280
you could end up with a pro box of

1630
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,519
treated seed that is very

1631
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,359
rigid um and would need some

1632
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:18,480
encouragement to flow out the bottom of

1633
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:22,078
the box

1634
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,719
so it's uh again air time is real

1635
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,839
important

1636
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:28,959
and sometimes we don't have that luxury

1637
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:30,558
other times we do um but in this case

1638
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,280
just to show you graphically from a

1639
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,000
photo

1640
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,400
um here you can imagine very limited air

1641
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,440
time

1642
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,480
just that nine or ten foot length space

1643
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,679
of the auger which

1644
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,159
actually there's a lot of sea treatment

1645
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:48,719
happening in that auger the sea is

1646
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:50,719
pushed up toward the discharge point

1647
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,558
so some adjustments to consider if

1648
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:56,078
you're faced with issues

1649
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:59,280
and sort of the the

1650
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:01,760
toolbox you might implore to try and

1651
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,040
deal with some of the issues

1652
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:08,319
of appearance and polymer

1653
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:11,279
is one of them there are polymers today

1654
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,079
that have very good shine elements to

1655
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,400
them

1656
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,680
and can also be met just depends what

1657
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,798
you're looking for

1658
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:21,199
but from the perspective of a polymer

1659
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:23,440
this is where i would look to try and

1660
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,439
improve appearance

1661
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,920
this is one of the avenues that would be

1662
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:31,838
first in the toolbox to pick up

1663
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,798
before appearance the amount of water

1664
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:36,639
that's used in the slurry this is

1665
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:40,000
something that we commonly

1666
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:41,679
get asked or are questioned about

1667
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,280
when people are having trouble with the

1668
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:45,440
coverage and

1669
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,640
a lot of times by just reducing a little

1670
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,079
bit of water

1671
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:51,838
uh in the overall slurry package we can

1672
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,559
improve the coverage

1673
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:55,920
by concentrating the actual liquids

1674
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,440
going on seed

1675
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,720
and it can be reversed too we can need a

1676
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,400
little bit more water to help with

1677
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,078
coverage but traditionally it's taking a

1678
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,720
little bit of water out

1679
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,480
um that that tends to help coverage when

1680
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:09,439
we're looking at appearance

1681
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,159
from a story perspective the atomizer

1682
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,280
and the equipment

1683
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,838
the atomizer does have an impact many

1684
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,119
people

1685
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:19,920
uh using certain types of atomizers

1686
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,640
for liquids have a basket or or some

1687
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,960
sort of

1688
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:25,519
webbing on that atomizer to help sling

1689
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,000
the liquids off the atomizer onto the

1690
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:30,639
seed mass passing by

1691
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,519
we tend to find that a disk atomizer

1692
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:35,279
gives us a

1693
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:38,559
better application onto seed

1694
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,599
due to the fact that it's just a fact of

1695
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,760
life

1696
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,440
we don't clean the atomizer probably as

1697
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,160
much as we ought to

1698
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,240
and the basket types over time we tend

1699
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:51,118
to clog the holes in the basket

1700
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:51,679
and we don't get a good movement of

1701
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,920
liquids

1702
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:55,838
off that basket into the seed mass

1703
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,159
because there's holes are plugged

1704
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,880
using a flat disc with a slight edge to

1705
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:01,838
it allows us to have immediate success

1706
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,960
of getting seat

1707
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:08,639
liquids onto seed and very minimal

1708
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:10,720
issues on cleaning finishing powders

1709
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:11,759
mentioned them earlier finishing powders

1710
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:13,759
themselves

1711
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,680
can aid in appearance there's the

1712
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,319
downfall that finishing powders may not

1713
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:18,239
stick

1714
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:19,519
to the finished product and may become

1715
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,719
airborne or

1716
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:24,159
become a dust off issue um so i would

1717
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:27,279
cautiously

1718
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:30,480
look at this as an area of

1719
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,200
potential improvement for appearance but

1720
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,559
they do work

1721
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:33,919
work effectively and if they're

1722
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:35,440
incorporated the right way with the

1723
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,599
right binding capacity

1724
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,119
of the particular polymer we can achieve

1725
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:42,079
wonderful things

1726
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,280
and then finally the actual color itself

1727
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,280
the color

1728
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,480
there's many color manufacturers out

1729
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,880
there in the industry

1730
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,400
and there are differences in color and

1731
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,079
that just needs to be tested

1732
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,920
and evaluated in your recipes that

1733
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,318
you're doing

1734
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,920
if we're having dust off issues i would

1735
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:00,400
go straight to the polymer

1736
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,200
uh look at that of course look at the

1737
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,680
water and the

1738
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:05,759
the amount of story that's being used

1739
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:08,639
but the polymer is going to be

1740
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,240
um the the tools that i'll be looking to

1741
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:11,519
here for dust off

1742
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:13,679
and making sure that we have the

1743
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:17,838
appropriate binding capacity

1744
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:20,000
of that polymer to ensure that we are

1745
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:21,679
holding on those seed treatment items on

1746
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,719
to seed

1747
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:27,039
pack flow ability and bridging that

1748
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,480
all boils down to an equipment polymer

1749
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:31,599
and finishing powder

1750
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,000
area and this area is where the toolbox

1751
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,160
exists

1752
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,920
for you to take a look at in terms of

1753
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:38,318
areas within the facility

1754
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,519
and and where improvements can be made

1755
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:42,639
from the equipment side

1756
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:45,119
maybe drying from the polymer side

1757
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:46,480
using a polymer that reduces uh the

1758
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,119
amount of finishing powder

1759
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,280
or a polymer that improves flow ability

1760
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:54,079
a polymer that cures faster

1761
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,839
that reduces that tack time that

1762
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,798
improves flow ability and lessens

1763
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:57,838
bridging

1764
00:59:56,798 --> 00:59:59,440
and of course if you're using a

1765
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:01,358
finishing powder making sure you get the

1766
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,960
right amount on not overdoing it

1767
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:05,039
and considering all the issues around

1768
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,880
that as well

1769
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:08,719
and then finally seed safety if we have

1770
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,960
issues around seed safety

1771
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:12,558
it's all around testing making sure that

1772
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,159
we're doing the appropriate tests in the

1773
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,079
appropriate lab manner

1774
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,719
to ensure that what we're putting on is

1775
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,480
done in advance of tests

1776
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:22,558
so that we can be assured that we hit

1777
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,199
the facility and the seed processing

1778
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,559
plant

1779
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:28,159
that we are doing no harm to the seed

1780
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:30,798
so these are some of the tools that i'd

1781
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:33,679
pull out when looking at a problem

1782
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:34,079
and employing multiple strategies and it

1783
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,279
takes

1784
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:40,640
multiple strategies to overcome problems

1785
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,640
in the facilities that we're working

1786
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:47,679
and with on i think we're just about on

1787
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:47,679
time for you alan

1788
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:52,959
oh peter this this is perfect uh thank

1789
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,720
you so much for your

1790
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:59,199
your great presentation and overview of

1791
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:01,039
all these modern sea technologies seed

1792
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:02,159
coating technologies and seed treatment

1793
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:04,960
technologies

1794
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:06,000
i want to open it up please if you have

1795
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:10,240
a question just

1796
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,119
unmute and ask or you could use the chat

1797
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:14,318
and type in

1798
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:17,039
uh your question there

1799
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:19,199
can you go to the last your lap last

1800
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:21,759
slide for that cca there we go

1801
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:22,798
so again those of you that want the cca

1802
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,160
credits

1803
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:26,798
that is the information for you on the

1804
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:31,199
cca

1805
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:31,199
credits for for peter's talk

1806
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,159
but again i want you to make sure any

1807
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,640
questions

1808
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:41,519
a lot of information to assimilate and

1809
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:41,519
things like that

1810
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:46,239
to process before they may be able to

1811
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,358
even ask a question i know i've

1812
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:53,838
taken notes as we're talking as well big

1813
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:53,838
big subject matter i know

1814
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,559
i'd like to just congratulate peter on a

1815
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:00,318
great presentation it's always

1816
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,720
interesting i see a lot of these topics

1817
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:02,318
but

1818
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:04,078
from our standpoint a little bit more

1819
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,038
from the field crops of the broad acre

1820
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,880
crops as you're

1821
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,480
referring to them whereas peter's coming

1822
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,519
some from the vegetable side so it's

1823
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,119
always interesting to see the

1824
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:12,639
differences in the issue

1825
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,480
i always say that i tend to look at the

1826
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:16,078
vegetable crops other specialty seeds to

1827
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,000
find out what's coming next

1828
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,599
what's going to hit us the fluidized bed

1829
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,280
dryers are showing up

1830
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:23,359
sometimes the one surprising things i

1831
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,440
see them often in soybean maybe more

1832
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:26,880
than corn uh certainly in cottonseed

1833
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,240
where they've got real high application

1834
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,119
rates but the soybeans don't tend to

1835
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:32,558
soak up the soy seed the water as well

1836
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,160
they just don't really like water that

1837
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,319
much and so sometimes you see

1838
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:37,199
things used that you wouldn't expect

1839
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:39,358
would ever

1840
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:41,118
perhaps be economically viable but if

1841
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:42,558
it's if there's enough volume involved

1842
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,920
and it can solve problems

1843
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,519
sometimes you know it's like getting a

1844
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,519
big hammer to make sure the problems

1845
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:49,280
taken care of but

1846
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:52,079
i i am seeing some of the same trends

1847
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,720
that that you're showing in there so

1848
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,720
thank you alan

1849
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:02,558
any any other questions yeah this is uh

1850
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:06,078
bob king

1851
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:08,240
uh and we keep hearing a lot about how

1852
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,318
uh weather and the climatic change and

1853
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:11,838
all that's have an impact or potentially

1854
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:13,838
could have an impact

1855
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:16,000
the what type of impact could you see on

1856
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:19,038
these technologies

1857
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,159
that's a great question that that is a

1858
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:24,240
a real factor so if you can imagine

1859
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:27,038
soybeans being stored in

1860
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:28,159
silos outdoors under very cold

1861
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:30,799
conditions

1862
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:31,920
and moving them into the seed treatment

1863
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:34,719
process

1864
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,480
there is a an adjustment that's made for

1865
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:38,239
that during the seed treatment process

1866
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,280
to ensure that recipe

1867
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,879
is appropriate we see later in the

1868
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,079
season when the beans warm up

1869
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,200
and they enter the seed treatment

1870
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:49,839
process that whole recipe changes

1871
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,558
and the the curing or the attacking that

1872
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:53,759
occurs

1873
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:56,960
that dynamic moves dramatically uh

1874
01:03:53,760 --> 01:04:00,240
from that that warming of the seed

1875
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:02,480
and so as our as our conditions change

1876
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:04,159
over the treating season we do see a

1877
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,318
difference of recipe

1878
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:07,358
adjustments to being need to make being

1879
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:10,880
have to make make

1880
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:13,279
make them and it's just

1881
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:15,280
with climate change and what's occurring

1882
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,200
we see more swings throughout that

1883
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,119
season than we have ever before

1884
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:20,318
and so i think we're going to have to

1885
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,160
employ

1886
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:24,318
different strategies throughout the

1887
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:26,960
season in order to overcome those

1888
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:28,318
obstacles that we that we see from the

1889
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,159
environment

1890
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:31,838
in controlled environments like a

1891
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:34,000
vegetable processing facility where

1892
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:37,440
we're dealing with seed and small lots

1893
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,199
that are that are more

1894
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,559
environmentally controlled we really

1895
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:42,399
don't see those issues but with

1896
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,599
particular crops we're storing vast

1897
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,720
amounts of seeds

1898
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:47,920
in basically environmental conditions

1899
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:51,199
that are different

1900
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:53,358
uh in almost ambient in cases we are

1901
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:55,439
experiencing those differences so it

1902
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:58,239
has to be employ a different strategy

1903
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:01,280
throughout the year for that

1904
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:03,519
thank you okay

1905
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:06,160
peter this is uh this is mike migliazzo

1906
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:10,400
um would you foresee an opportunity

1907
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:13,440
um for in the polymer industry

1908
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:15,358
to tailor uh properties for polymers

1909
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,679
that have different film forming

1910
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:19,519
characteristics for these weather to

1911
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:21,358
address some of the weather conditions

1912
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:22,639
that seeds are being treated in any time

1913
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:24,558
between like

1914
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:25,679
some people treating december some treat

1915
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,359
in may

1916
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:31,598
um yeah yeah

1917
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:32,400
that's exactly right mike and uh thanks

1918
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,359
for the question

1919
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,000
and and we do see that and we are seeing

1920
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:39,038
some

1921
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:42,400
some asks around binding capacity

1922
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:44,480
to adjust that binding capacity to

1923
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,079
match the environmental condition the

1924
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,119
problem is we can't predict it

1925
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:50,240
and we could run ourselves into a little

1926
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,720
bit of an issue

1927
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:53,838
one way or the other on that knife edge

1928
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:55,679
of an area

1929
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:58,480
but there are small tweaks we can do

1930
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:00,318
within that polymer space to allow us

1931
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,639
tweaks of the binding capacity of the

1932
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:04,960
same product to give the same look

1933
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:05,679
but to change the overall dynamics of

1934
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,880
the

1935
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:08,879
rheology of the product

1936
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,159
this has been a production of cornell

1937
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:22,720
university

1938
