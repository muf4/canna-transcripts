00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,199
have a lot to share

55
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,759
uh on hemp and and how it performs in

56
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,919
food um seems to be a new category for

57
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,919
many I think the the features and you

58
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:42,359
know the understanding and the the

59
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,839
interest in hemp in the past has been

60
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,080
around canabo and fiber so I'm excited

61
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,719
to show what this what the seed the

62
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,920
protein specifically from the seed does

63
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,598
in food

64
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:55,559
formulations um and again I'm I'm

65
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:59,280
incredibly excited about this it's it's

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,840
a an amazingly versatile ingredient I'm

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,280
going to uh start sharing my screen I'm

68
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,759
kind of go through presentation that we

69
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,479
put together I'm going to kind of just

70
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,639
you know it's mostly a collection of

71
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,798
photographs and uh I'm going to just

72
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,958
start explaining a little bit about what

73
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,480
we do

74
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,799
so um as Lucia had mentioned I'm a

75
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:28,959
certified Master Baker um I've been in

76
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,400
the bakery industry for 37 years this

77
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,840
year

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,000
and

79
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,680
um I started off in conventional Bakery

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,479
uh in 1998 I got certified got my

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,040
certification as a master Baker 2001 I

82
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,039
moved to Colorado a couple years later I

83
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:52,639
met a woman with severe food

84
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:54,598
allergies and she introduced me to the

85
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,078
free from Market uh previous to that I

86
00:03:54,598 --> 00:04:00,878
had really had no exposure to it um I

87
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,920
specialized in product development so I

88
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,919
immediately started formulating products

89
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,639
for her and for her children who were

90
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:10,639
both Celiac uh a few years later you

91
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,878
know this this really changed the course

92
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,438
of my career um a couple years later I

93
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,000
had a full Suite of formulations and uh

94
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,599
started looking for business partners to

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,079
bring those to Market met a couple of

96
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,879
guys here in Colorado udy and eai Baron

97
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,759
and we started a company called gluten

98
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,240
ud's gluten-free foods um and I learned

99
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,360
a tremendous amount during that

100
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,680
experience uh one was that we really

101
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,199
needed to work more on the specific

102
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,038
ingredients available for bakers baking

103
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,319
gluten-free products the the ingredients

104
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:43,120
had to be designed specifically for

105
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,599
gluten-free uh the other thing was that

106
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,240
we needed much better nutrition and and

107
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,879
the formulations at that time even

108
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,120
though they were decent uh they they

109
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,639
they could be better and so you know

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,280
post udis we I started a company called

111
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,079
gluten-free baking solutions that was in

112
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,719
2016 that company and a couple of others

113
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,758
a sprouting and malting Company and a

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:10,160
blending company all got rolled together

115
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,479
into uh what is today Nea Foods so nepra

116
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,080
uh is actually an adjective it is

117
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,599
Esperanto uh it means absolutely

118
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:20,159
essential and that's really how we view

119
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,960
what we do every single day we we don't

120
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,319
just create ingredients for the greater

121
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,198
Market we also create formulations and

122
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:32,000
we and we really center around better

123
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:35,439
for you and and uh you know nutritious

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
eating so with me today is Kim she is

125
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,959
our registered dietitian our project

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,879
manager our account manager our

127
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,359
everything uh she is actually our

128
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,319
internal rock star so I'm super excited

129
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,840
to have her here I'll go through some of

130
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,840
the applications of the hemp in food and

131
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,599
then I'll pass it over to to Kim at the

132
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,679
last half to uh to kind of discuss the

133
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
the nutrition a little bit more at

134
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,879
length because there's a lot to unpack

135
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,879
there as well

136
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,400
so obviously we'll go over these points

137
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,680
here in just a few minutes um you know

138
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,079
what our general mission is you know why

139
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,879
we're so interested in hemp uh and then

140
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,159
some of the the characteristics of hemp

141
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,399
it's versatility you know the

142
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,680
functionality what foods it's really

143
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,519
suited well for uh and then some cpg

144
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,879
brands that are starting to launch into

145
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:27,279
the market today with hemp included and

146
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:29,879
uh and then of course those things that

147
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,079
Kim will address the the nutrition and

148
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,399
then some of the other things that we'd

149
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,918
love to see moving forward from

150
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,439
institutions like Cornell uh as they put

151
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,799
together their hemp programs we'd have

152
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,399
some we have some requests some things

153
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,280
that we would like to see uh you know

154
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:47,038
done in the

155
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,318
future so

156
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:53,918
nepra you know we we really are

157
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,199
interested in making food for everyone

158
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:59,839
uh allergen-free foods that taste great

159
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,759
that that you know that there's nothing

160
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,359
lacking right we don't want our

161
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,800
consumers to feel like you know they're

162
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,598
they're they're getting less and so we

163
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,800
really concentrated on worldclass Foods

164
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,959
um my brother for instance is a port is

165
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,000
a part of our company and he was a sue

166
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,239
chef at The French Laundry and we've

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,918
taken some of that high level expertise

168
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,079
and Incorporated that into what we do uh

169
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:27,318
you know every day here in terms of

170
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:30,359
developing uh new food

171
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:33,598
products the similarly

172
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,479
um you know we we develop formulations

173
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,279
for Brands globally and our primary

174
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,839
objective is to make these Foods

175
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:43,839
absolutely delicious but then to back

176
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:46,959
that up with a really great nutritional

177
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,239
profile so that you know a lot of times

178
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,198
some of these individuals that have

179
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,680
celiac disease and some other autoimmune

180
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,240
diseases they they really are lacking

181
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,680
and certain nutrients and and so we we

182
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,560
really make a strong effort to bring

183
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,120
these things incorporate them into the

184
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,280
foods that we're

185
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,240
producing so you know one of the bullet

186
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,598
points here deliver nutrition without

187
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,800
compromise and that's really that really

188
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,759
kind of sums it

189
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,840
up the other thing that we're really

190
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,520
doing that I think is important it's

191
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,679
this last bullet point it's

192
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,000
standardizing the ingredients that are

193
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,519
used in allergen-free baking um you

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,038
think about wheat flour for instance

195
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,799
wheat is highly standardized for protein

196
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:29,158
content quality of protein damage starch

197
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,560
levels enzyme activity all these you

198
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:34,278
know uh characteristics that become very

199
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,320
important for a for a food producer to

200
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:38,360
be able to produce consistent products

201
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,320
well many gluten-free ingredients don't

202
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,240
enjoy that same level of standardization

203
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,000
so nepra is really working on that as

204
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,799
well and hemp definitely plays a role

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,278
here and what we're trying to do is is

206
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:54,958
as we work through the various

207
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:58,278
extractions of hemp protein um we look

208
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,479
at what we can do to to uh standardize

209
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:03,600
that ingredient so that other food

210
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,800
producers know exactly how to use it and

211
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,278
and

212
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:12,199
uh and what forms of the protein they

213
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:14,759
should be looking for so why hemp uh I

214
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,839
think first of all you know I I would

215
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,078
say the nutrition is is outstanding Kim

216
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,560
will speak to that in a few minutes but

217
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:23,879
from my standpoint it's the absolute

218
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:24,679
versatility of the ingredient if you see

219
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:29,399
that

220
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:30,958
picture on the side here we've got uh a

221
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,759
few different items that in the middle

222
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,599
is a hemp heart flour that we produce

223
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,200
internally we got toasted hemp seeds we

224
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,159
have the hemp seed oil in the very back

225
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,800
and on the left is actually a hemp uh

226
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:44,278
margarine so lots of different

227
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,159
components within the seed itself um

228
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,399
we're talking about a pretty significant

229
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,519
amount of protein you've got a outer

230
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,839
shell uh once the shell has come off

231
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,959
then you've got a hemp heart the heart

232
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,800
itself is is about 50% oil it's about

233
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:04,479
34% protein and then you've got smaller

234
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,838
fractions of starch and fiber uh and

235
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,959
then you've got a really great Ash

236
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,440
content lots of

237
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:12,278
minerals what's interesting is that once

238
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,720
you get the oil out of the way once

239
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:17,600
you've extracted the oil and and how you

240
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,800
extract it too is very important um you

241
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,920
want to make sure that you're not

242
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,879
damaging the protein during the oil

243
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:27,679
extraction process uh a lot of a lot of

244
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:30,720
protein producers will use a screw press

245
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:33,120
with the hole on there's some some

246
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,600
negatives to doing that one you end up

247
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,039
the high pressures involved in those

248
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,200
systems denature the the hemp protein to

249
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:43,399
an extent um and then you get you know

250
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,000
tannins and uh chlorophyll and some

251
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,720
other things that that penetrate the

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,958
protein and those become very difficult

253
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,759
to get out and as a result the proteins

254
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,799
that you see in those types of systems

255
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:57,200
are green uh they are slightly bitter um

256
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,559
they have very limited functionality in

257
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,560
terms of of structure building property

258
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,278
those types of things and as as a

259
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,319
consequence they don't tend to be very

260
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:10,320
usable in Food Systems and so what we've

261
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,600
really done is identify the best ways to

262
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,480
extract the protein and uh and and

263
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,680
enhance it its

264
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,159
functionality so what we're doing

265
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:23,759
basically is is dehulling the seed first

266
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:26,159
and then we're going through a uh

267
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,480
solvent-based ex we're going through a a

268
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,078
pressing uh stage uh kind of liquid if

269
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,320
Ying the the hearts and then we're going

270
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:36,679
through a separation process being being

271
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,440
highly cognizant of the uh proteins

272
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,879
functionality and trying to preserve

273
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,560
that the end result is a protein that is

274
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:48,360
white in color slightly sweet and nutty

275
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:51,399
and has this amazing functionality very

276
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,600
similar to whole eggs which is

277
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:56,240
incredible because it's that level of

278
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,000
functionality that will that will allow

279
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,200
for all the foods that that I'll kind of

280
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,519
go through um and we've kind of centered

281
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,000
on on Bakery items but we got a few

282
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:09,639
others in there as well

283
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,399
so because it's white in color obviously

284
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,198
there's you know no negative impact to a

285
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,639
bakery formulation uh I'm not turning my

286
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:22,039
my Bread's green which is good uh the

287
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,639
slight you know the the the very um

288
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:26,159
palatable flavor it's like when I say

289
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,639
sweet and nutty I mean it there's a

290
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,799
subtle sweetness to the protein uh it's

291
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,159
nutty and it's quite Pleasant just by

292
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,120
itself but again that really lends

293
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:38,198
itself well to formulation because you

294
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,320
don't have to cover over any odd flavors

295
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:42,879
I work with plant-based proteins across

296
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,720
the board potato protein uh canola

297
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,439
protein both of which taste terrible but

298
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,720
have great

299
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,199
functionality um you know you think

300
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,160
about P protein limited functionality

301
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:56,639
it's got a decent gel but but doesn't

302
00:12:54,159 --> 00:13:00,000
have a lot of other uh properties tends

303
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,519
to be somewhat chalky um

304
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,720
you know soy obviously has some problems

305
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,278
and that uh you know it carries the

306
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,519
allergen

307
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:13,600
um you know these as as hemp relates to

308
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,600
back to each one of these uh in my

309
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,560
opinion it is the king and as we talk

310
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,278
about the hemp industry and where it's

311
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:26,078
going it is my humble opinion that uh

312
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:28,799
that uh hemp protein and hemp foods will

313
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:31,519
be the first multi-billion dollar hemp

314
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,000
industry indry um and I think and I hope

315
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,039
that that some of these images and some

316
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,078
of this conversation really kind of

317
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:41,599
illustrate why that is or why I think

318
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,359
that will be so here in these in these

319
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,159
pictures we've got on the left here

320
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,800
we've got a textured hemp protein that

321
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:50,480
we've manufactured if you look so this

322
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:53,399
is this is High Press Extrusion this is

323
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,240
just hemp by itself and when you extru

324
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:59,720
the hemp you can see that it forms these

325
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,919
really nice textures uh when this is pre

326
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,278
when this is wet again uh those textures

327
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:07,278
are very reminiscent of chicken

328
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,639
structures like chicken protein

329
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,679
structures um also interestingly because

330
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,440
of the and you know that we've got a

331
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:16,399
really fun fundamentally inhemp you've

332
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,120
got an amazing Amino

333
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,600
complex um that Amino complex is very

334
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,720
high in glutamine and glutamine as we

335
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,600
know is is the primary uh amino acid

336
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:33,399
responsible for Umami flavor so within

337
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,399
the hemp when we extrude it uh it sounds

338
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:39,519
like popcorn in the factory you know

339
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:41,440
it's like pop but it smells like turkey

340
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,320
and it's the most bizarre thing but when

341
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,680
you rehydrate this protein the natural

342
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,399
flavor is meat you can't identify what

343
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:53,198
it is but you want to call it a poultry

344
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,320
so it's very interesting from that

345
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,758
standpoint that kind of leads into the

346
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,720
next slide where we've made a

347
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:04,120
mayonnaise so

348
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:08,399
so this mayonnaise is really just hemp

349
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,198
it is hemp protein with hemp a clarified

350
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,039
hemp oil so we actually remove the gums

351
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:15,679
and waxes from the oil and then we we

352
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,360
create internally an enzyme hydrolized

353
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:23,198
hemp Amino that liquid amino we

354
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,079
standardize at 12% uh saline uh we can

355
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,120
dilute it down to about 6% and it'll

356
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:32,278
still be uh stable at room temperature

357
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:36,000
but that that uh that that Amino uh

358
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:37,958
liquid the Umami flavor is absolutely

359
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
outstanding it's amazing and so this

360
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:42,958
mayonnaise we add a little bit of that

361
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,759
uh hydrolized hemp Amino liquid back in

362
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,399
for some Umami flavor but then also to

363
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,839
satisfy the need for the salt in the

364
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,000
formula and then we add a little bit of

365
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,240
vinegar and lemon juice uh just to you

366
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,919
know bring the acidity down a little bit

367
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,440
the result is a product that tastes just

368
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,879
like helman's mayonnaise it is

369
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,839
absolutely incredible the flavor is so

370
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,559
good and this picture also has our

371
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:09,560
gluten-free bread uh featured that bread

372
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,638
we use the hemp protein as the primary

373
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,318
egg replacement of course in gluten-free

374
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:19,120
baking we don't have gluten obviously

375
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:22,120
and so we end up usually um using eggs

376
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,639
for for the the the protein

377
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:29,480
structure excuse me so hemp because it

378
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:32,839
replaces eggs in literally every Bakery

379
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:36,480
formula that I've tried it in um it it

380
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:39,240
does an amazing job of of uh helping

381
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,600
create this backbone and this structure

382
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,000
further comment here that I think is is

383
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,399
very cool and important to

384
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,559
Bakers egg whites when if I were to use

385
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,759
uh egg whites in this formulation for

386
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,559
our bread um and I should back up a

387
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,000
little bit we have a we have a we have a

388
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:58,078
gluten-free bread technology that we've

389
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,240
developed that uses some some of our

390
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,399
proprietary starches and some of our

391
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,000
other ingredients but then it also uses

392
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,078
our hemp protein egg

393
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,679
replacers if I were to make that

394
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:12,119
formulation with egg whites that product

395
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,160
would only get about 21 days of ambient

396
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,239
shelf life stay soft and flexible but

397
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,120
the egg whites actually have a drying

398
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,120
effect on the crumb structure by using

399
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,918
hemp protein I'm able to get an

400
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,958
additional 10 days of shelf life out of

401
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,600
that product primarily because of the

402
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:32,640
globular nature of the uh of the hemp

403
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:34,319
hemp protein is roughly 65% globulin uh

404
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,120
specific globular protein called IND

405
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,839
destine and 35%

406
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,959
albumin the albumin and the globulins

407
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,599
are both highly soluble uh in

408
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,798
combination you know the albumin's fully

409
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:49,918
soluble the the globulins to the to

410
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:52,119
about 70 so percent give or take uh but

411
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,480
be because the globular proteins are so

412
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:56,519
efficient at binding water that that

413
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,960
moisture is bound up in the product for

414
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:59,720
a long period of time one of the other

415
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,798
things that we're finding is that the

416
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,240
protein structures actually help

417
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:07,279
encapsulate some of the starch the

418
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,519
starches and prevent retrogradation so

419
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,240
very very

420
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:15,279
interesting the next slide over the next

421
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,759
picture is a hemp milk that we've made

422
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,918
and what I wanted to illustrate here was

423
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:24,200
the uh the the foam that could be

424
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:26,240
created uh through steaming so you make

425
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,360
a hemp milk not only is it incredibly

426
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,400
neutral in its flavor very very Dairy

427
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,079
reminiscent um

428
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,200
there's the uh I was going to say there

429
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:39,000
was we've got some versions that have a

430
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,880
little bit of residual oil in them as

431
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,319
well and they have a wonderful creamy

432
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:49,720
flavor that kind of is just again very

433
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:52,200
Dairy like um hemp oil the the U uh

434
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,400
specific oils in hemp it's a very low

435
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,600
molecular weight oil it's got It's a

436
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,519
very small molecule and and then uh

437
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:01,719
similar to Dairy oil you know Dairy

438
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,240
and so there's kind of a creamy effect

439
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,960
there that that you get that's really

440
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:10,960
quite nice

441
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:12,840
um moving over uh those pretzels what we

442
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,960
wanted to kind of demonstrate there was

443
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,720
the the impact of the amino acids in the

444
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,400
hemp on the mayard

445
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,519
reaction um as I make gluten-free

446
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,440
products obviously what I'm trying to do

447
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:28,480
is emulate wheat based products I want

448
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,600
uh I want the the consumer the person

449
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,200
eating eating this to really feel like

450
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:37,038
they're getting a a true a real piece of

451
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,840
bread and and so um the mayard reaction

452
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:41,839
is obviously a part of that and it's

453
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:45,279
just very interesting that that uh the

454
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:48,839
specific Amino complex in hemp ends up

455
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,639
creating very similar flavors and colors

456
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,798
to as to what you would see in a normal

457
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,960
wheat-based product uh to kind of

458
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:58,119
illustrate that further I got this next

459
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,480
slide um I was producing these pretzels

460
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:03,519
on a line in

461
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,038
Indiana and uh Plymouth Indiana

462
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:10,158
specifically and uh we were running

463
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:12,798
gluten-based pretzels on on one line and

464
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,120
gluten-free pretzels on a line in the

465
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,440
next room so I grabbed some of the

466
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,918
gluten-based pretzels those are the top

467
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,240
three you see in my hand there and yes

468
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:27,600
I'm not wearing gloves in the uh Factory

469
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:30,759
but that's okay um the bottom three are

470
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,959
are uh gluten fre and with the addition

471
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,599
of hemp and so the reason we were adding

472
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,519
hemp in this formula specifically was to

473
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:41,759
capitalize on its pseudo emulsification

474
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,279
properties um that prior slide that I

475
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,000
should have mentioned this before I'll

476
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,879
go back just very quickly to mention

477
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,880
this this mayonnaise down below where uh

478
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,640
I got this little caption 10 grams of

479
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,360
hemp protein is emulsifying in this case

480
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,280
300 gram of oil so the pseudo

481
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,359
emulsification properties of the hemp

482
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,038
are quite amazing and so in this

483
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,240
particular formula we were looking to

484
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:06,679
replace leian we wanted to get the

485
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,319
sunflower leian out and uh we wanted to

486
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,919
try to use hemp for that purpose so we

487
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,399
started at around two Bakers percent

488
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,559
which is about one one and a half% true

489
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,759
in this type of

490
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:21,440
formulation and um we we uh we got good

491
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,158
results there but we wanted to see how

492
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,000
little we could add and get the same

493
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,880
effect and so we started taking it down

494
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,159
we found that with only a half a percent

495
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,919
addition of hemp to that formula that we

496
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,080
ended up with a mayard reaction that was

497
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:39,038
almost identical to wheat and also a

498
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:42,798
flavor impact even at that smallest

499
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:45,000
level so this slide kind of speaking to

500
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,918
some of the functionality we we we test

501
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,278
and play with all different types of

502
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,360
hemp extractions and uh we've played

503
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:54,640
with all different types of uh solvents

504
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:57,079
uh we we favor obviously the clean

505
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,559
solvents uh you know we're we're going

506
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:00,599
down the road of organic EOL extraction

507
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:03,599
with a

508
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:06,399
refunctionalization step uh right behind

509
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,798
it uh the solvents do denature the

510
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,080
protein slightly as you extract it but

511
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,440
as long as they have not been heat

512
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,879
denatured they can be refunctionalized

513
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,919
and so we go through that process uh

514
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,159
We've also played with CO2 uh my

515
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,640
Discovery there has been that the high

516
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,679
pressures associated with liquefying the

517
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,440
the CO2 uh actually have a damaging

518
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,519
effect on the proteins so I do a little

519
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,200
bit less of that but those types of

520
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,480
processes that process in particular

521
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,558
yields a very bright white uh high

522
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,919
quality protein so nutritively it's

523
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:44,119
great in some cases I want less

524
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,520
functionality out of the hemp and so I

525
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:47,119
really kind of favor those types of

526
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,240
extractions for formulas where I'm

527
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,000
looking to build in nutrition but I

528
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,759
don't necessarily want those egg-like

529
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,079
you know structures to overpower the

530
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:59,558
formulation uh something like a pretzel

531
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:01,960
for instance where I want the starches

532
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:04,440
to really be the uh the focal point you

533
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,720
know for mouth feel and everything else

534
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,840
uh in in low pressure Extrusion systems

535
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,919
like that crackers and and pret pretzels

536
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,119
um you know too high of a protein

537
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,840
content can lead to a rather hard bite

538
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,239
and so I'm always trying to make these

539
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,639
I'm trying to balance these these uh

540
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,200
these these factors and effects and so a

541
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,120
form so a protein specific for that uh

542
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,840
you where where you're seeing a little

543
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:32,479
bit of protein denaturing I think is is

544
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:34,959
uh is is a good thing these images here

545
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,440
we're really just testing the foaming

546
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,480
capacity of the hemp uh we're testing

547
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,558
the gel strength uh after we've after

548
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,599
we've baked it and then we're performing

549
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,399
a hydration test so there's all these

550
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:48,399
little tests that we'll perform

551
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,200
internally uh and we've got various

552
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,798
pieces of equipment too that will really

553
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,840
U kind of Aid and assist in that so that

554
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:58,720
because you know at the end of the day

555
00:23:54,839 --> 00:24:02,199
we're looking for consistent results

556
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,600
so these pictures all bread obviously um

557
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,120
the all of these formulations utilize

558
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:09,879
hemp primarily these are all

559
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,000
gluten-free uh and and they and they all

560
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,640
utilize the hemp primarily as the egg

561
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,759
replacer and we've we've got lots of

562
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,240
partner brands that are going to be

563
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:22,158
releasing products into the marketplace

564
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,240
uh this year and going into next year

565
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,559
that contain hemp so what's really

566
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,079
exciting is that you are going to be

567
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:34,000
seeing at Shelf multiple products with

568
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:36,119
hemp in the very very near future um and

569
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and and it's it's kind of a cascading

570
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,158
effect as we introduce these ingredients

571
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,720
uh you know these variations of hemp

572
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:47,200
protein to specific manufacturers they

573
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,360
are finding that it is solving problems

574
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,278
for them um I mentioned the enhancement

575
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:55,639
to shelf life and the bread that's one

576
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:56,759
um but but there's but there's others as

577
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,440
well

578
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,798
and um I guess too I could I can mention

579
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,798
a little bit about you know relative

580
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:05,558
ratios of hemp and how much you add in

581
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:07,240
for those types of things if anybody's

582
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:10,398
got questions about that you can

583
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:13,399
certainly put it in the chat

584
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:16,000
um but uh I'll kind of talk through it a

585
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:18,000
little bit as well um I find that in

586
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,798
most formulations for bread I don't like

587
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,480
to go over about

588
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:27,798
20% uh hemp uh because it just ends up

589
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,599
being too much the globular protein uh

590
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:33,038
coagula at around

591
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:35,079
170° so higher than egg wood but uh but

592
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,359
this is good in gluten-free formulations

593
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:39,798
truly because I'll get additional

594
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,519
volume um up until the point that it

595
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:45,278
sets uh we do get good expansion in the

596
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,879
products uh but once the protein if it

597
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:50,119
at higher concentrations once that

598
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,679
protein starts to coagulate you do see a

599
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:55,558
a a slight reduction in volume as the

600
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:59,679
proteins kind of um Aggregate and

601
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:59,678
collapse a little bit

602
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:05,120
so um obviously we we have done just

603
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,759
about every type of Bakery product you

604
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:11,319
can imagine uh these tortilla chips are

605
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,919
actually mostly hemp and what we're

606
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:15,639
doing is we nixtamalize the hemp so

607
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,278
we're putting in a giant steep tanks

608
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,679
with calcium hydroxide uh there's not

609
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:24,919
much starch in in uh in the hemp to

610
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,600
swell but they do swell a little bit um

611
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:29,559
you know those relative percentages

612
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:32,119
about 5% starge 5% fiber give or take so

613
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:34,839
we do see some some swelling of the

614
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:37,519
starch uh and it does form a dough when

615
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:40,199
we subject it to the calcium hydroxide

616
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,200
the um the other interesting thing is

617
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:47,120
that

618
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:49,319
uh um it tends to uh uh well you get a

619
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,398
good amount of rology in the dough but

620
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,599
then you get this really nice flavor

621
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:56,000
development uh it's a very very cool

622
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,119
process these chips end up tasting very

623
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,119
similar to corn chips uh you don't get

624
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:02,359
the the corn flavor obviously but but

625
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,519
they're very sweet and nutty and and and

626
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:07,278
very neutral in their flavor over here

627
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:10,119
on the right you see a band full of uh

628
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,119
low press extruded pretzels uh they're

629
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:14,918
they're being cut with the guillotine on

630
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:18,398
the inside of the cage there and laying

631
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:20,679
down on the Belt these you'll see these

632
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,398
actual pretzels you'll see in a bag with

633
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:26,440
one of our uh Partners here in in

634
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:29,319
a in a couple of minutes one of the

635
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,278
slides um and we're excited because

636
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:33,879
again you know we're seeing hemp really

637
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,480
make its way into common

638
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,200
foods uh not you know there's no reason

639
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,278
to to necessarily call it out it's a

640
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,600
functional ingredient uh but we're using

641
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:46,319
it you know primarily for for these

642
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,719
specific you know structural

643
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:52,000
purposes foam stability this is

644
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,200
obviously a mering uh technically it's a

645
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,440
pavlova uh so we keep it a little bit

646
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,558
soft we it's an underbaked mering I say

647
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,759
I guess you could call it uh um if you

648
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:04,798
look at the the the mering on the Whisk

649
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:06,798
there uh you notice it's not as stiff as

650
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,720
egg whites and I think that really

651
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:12,000
speaks to the higher level of globulin

652
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,120
um it does you know it kind of sags a

653
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,079
little bit as we would say in the bakery

654
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:18,639
industry uh you know on the pictures on

655
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:20,639
the top right you see that I've kind of

656
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,640
piped it out and and I've used a star

657
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,159
tip to illustrate uh that that it kind

658
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,720
of just melts in a little bit it doesn't

659
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,480
really hold the peak um baking those

660
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,880
those uh that star pattern is kind of uh

661
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,919
disappeared entirely but if you look at

662
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,600
the bottom right picture you can see the

663
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,600
structure on the inside it is incredibly

664
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:45,759
delicious this is this formulation is

665
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:51,119
literally just hemp protein water and

666
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:53,839
sugar so um the Pavlova taste amazing

667
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,759
they look great uh they function for all

668
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:59,678
intents purposes identically to a to an

669
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,720
you know to their egg counterpart

670
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,399
just without the

671
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,319
allergen we heavily we're heavily into

672
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:09,239
pastas um we're actually looking at

673
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,798
bringing these products to Market

674
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,798
potentially under our own brand uh

675
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:16,519
future Endeavor uh but we've come up

676
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:20,599
with a really special formulation so

677
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:24,720
here on the left we've got a u uh kind

678
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:28,119
of a chowman if you will the noodles are

679
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,600
hemp this formulation of hemp pasta is

680
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:35,319
30 gram of protein per serving so on 100

681
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:38,199
gram dry basis uh you boil that 100 gram

682
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:41,678
it becomes 220 gram which is essentially

683
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:44,840
a full bowl of pasta that serving 100

684
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:48,000
grams is 30 gram of

685
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:51,278
protein uh only 30 net carbs and 20

686
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,798
grams of Prebiotic fiber has the same

687
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:57,200
alente chew as a regular wheat based

688
00:29:53,798 --> 00:30:00,000
pasta and that is partially due to the

689
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,200
hemp protein that globular protein once

690
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,440
it's cooked gives you this amazing chew

691
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,798
the bite is phenomenal so that same chew

692
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,600
or that bite is communicated through

693
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:13,519
what looks to be pork on top of that

694
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,558
Chowan it's actually more hemp that's

695
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,278
our textured hemp protein in this case

696
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:21,879
we did Flavor it uh to taste more like

697
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:24,679
pork uh that was what we were going for

698
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:29,919
the center pictures there we've got a a

699
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:32,798
chicken crumbled um uh like enchilada uh

700
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,559
with actual hemp cheese on it as well

701
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,918
and then the tortilla itself we made

702
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,918
that with hemp the meatballs that you

703
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:42,919
see there those are lamb flavored uh

704
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,519
lamb and beef flavored but they are all

705
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:49,278
hemp um

706
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:51,038
so the again going back to the fact that

707
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:53,159
that uh you know when you texturize the

708
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:56,759
hemp it it forms these really

709
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:59,760
wonderful uh textures uh reminiscent of

710
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:02,119
meat structure we pair the hemp

711
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,158
sometimes with other proteins to achieve

712
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:06,278
various results in this case with the

713
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,080
meatballs we paired it with PE protein

714
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:11,720
where we wanted a little bit more of a a

715
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:14,798
firm bite less chicken-like more beef

716
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,839
likee so um you know it kind of speaks

717
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,359
to the again to the versatility of hemp

718
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:22,240
being able to stack it with other

719
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:24,158
proteins to achieve various results on

720
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,960
the right uh we have a picture of our

721
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,760
ravioli the the the shell of the ravioli

722
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,360
is again our our hemp pasta but on the

723
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:36,398
inside there we've got our hemp Rota

724
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:39,599
so you know going back to the glutamine

725
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:42,079
levels in hemp they sit at about 19% of

726
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,079
the total Amino complex Dairy proteins

727
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,798
are like

728
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:51,398
21% uh glutamine so you've got a lot of

729
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:53,638
crossover flavor with dairy products um

730
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:56,839
treated in the right way you can create

731
00:31:53,638 --> 00:32:00,638
hemp based you know Dairy Alternatives

732
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:02,480
that are on are flavor-wise with dairy

733
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:04,638
uh really great levels of functionality

734
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,440
as I demonstrated before with that foam

735
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:09,158
you know you can do if a barista at

736
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,759
Starbucks got our hemp milk you would be

737
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,600
hard pressed to tell it wasn't really

738
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:14,720
just dairy milk uh and the foam is is

739
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,719
almost

740
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,720
identical

741
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:25,240
so kind of keep going on um we did a

742
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:29,000
dinner here in our Colorado location two

743
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,120
years ago um I believe two years ago

744
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,960
maybe

745
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:38,798
three been here a while uh we'll call it

746
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:42,639
two years ago um we we did an 11 course

747
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:47,000
fine dining experience entirely based on

748
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:50,439
hemp every single uh every single course

749
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,159
was primarily hemp obviously the focus

750
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,679
was hemp and so in this uh cucumber

751
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:59,399
salad we've got a breaded hemp goat

752
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:01,600
cheese quote unquote goat cheese uh

753
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:03,918
texture though and flavor came off

754
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:06,079
exactly like goat cheese it was really

755
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,159
really quite nice now we put sprouted

756
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:11,918
hemp seeds on top this uh shepherd's pie

757
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:14,600
this the the second one over we did what

758
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:18,240
we called an inside out shephard's pie

759
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:21,000
so it was the meat quote unquote meat on

760
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,960
the outside and it was stuffed with

761
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,919
mashed potatoes on the inside so we used

762
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:30,240
a uh Ron co-extruder a kayen to to uh to

763
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,278
to build these uh and then we made a

764
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,839
hemp demig gloss and uh and then put the

765
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:39,200
of course the the carrots and and peas

766
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:43,359
around the outside the tagat again it's

767
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:46,679
that hemp pasta uh we did shaved truffle

768
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:50,839
with this and um and then we did a hemp

769
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,759
cheese uh like a a crini hemp cheese you

770
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:56,000
know and then the cream sauce just

771
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:59,240
really really amazing flavors um hemp

772
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,679
lends itself well to uh to desserts as

773
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:08,599
well um that is a little miniature

774
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:10,280
p uh p is basically a puff pastry and uh

775
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:13,639
so this is a hemp based puff pastry

776
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:16,000
gluten-free and on the inside we did a

777
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,480
uh a Fran jaipan so frangipan is

778
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,440
normally made with almonds and sugar and

779
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,639
and you bake like a paste um in this

780
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,240
case I did a hemp FR Japan so I toasted

781
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,119
hemp seeds I combined them with sugar

782
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,078
and I and I made this uh particular

783
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,480
paste on the inside it was really really

784
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:35,839
wonderful uh and then you know aside

785
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,398
from the U the Cherry compot there in

786
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:42,320
the middle there's a a a hemp based

787
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:45,199
Chantell on the right and so again

788
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,679
speaking to the functionality of hemp

789
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:51,559
you this one protein can emulsify and

790
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,760
make a mayonnaise or it can be whipped

791
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:57,400
into a a whipped cream uh but then it

792
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,440
can also make a mering at the same time

793
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,519
and and uh I mean I challenge you to

794
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,119
find other proteins especially

795
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:06,159
plant-based proteins that will do that

796
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:09,000
again just speaking to the versatility

797
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:11,759
it's quite it's quite

798
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,239
amazing so these are some of the uh

799
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,040
products that we'll be seeing coming

800
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:18,078
into the market this

801
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:20,119
year uh you know again what hemp is

802
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,240
doing in every one of these is slightly

803
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:25,240
different uh in in the in the case of

804
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:27,959
the breads it's an egg replacer in the

805
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:29,959
case of the pasta It's a feature so

806
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,679
we're talking about a huge amount of

807
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:37,039
hemp and uh and then that hemp is is

808
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:39,838
specifically adding to the bite as well

809
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:42,639
as as obviously carrying a large portion

810
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:45,440
of the flavor and the the pasta eats so

811
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,358
well the flavor is so good uh but what

812
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,639
really rounds it out are those Beautiful

813
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:52,159
Textures that are REM reminiscent of a

814
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:54,000
real pasta um the other thing that's

815
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:56,679
interesting too is that most gluten-free

816
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,480
pastas tend to fall apart in the water

817
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:01,879
uh and they don't hold well they don't

818
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,960
retort well um and so what's very cool

819
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,160
about this pasta is that you can par

820
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,880
boil it so for a restaurant setting this

821
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:11,199
is incredibly important you can par boil

822
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,720
it you can pre-portion it and hold it

823
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:16,598
and then you can Flash it to order so a

824
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,318
restaurant could take it put it in the

825
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:20,480
fridge and when they have a customer

826
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:22,279
that requests a gluten-free pasta they

827
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,358
could bring this out and they could just

828
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:28,160
put it right into the sauce reheat and

829
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:32,000
then serve immediately fresh so uh

830
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:34,598
again just it's it's so cool that that a

831
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,440
single ingredient will will have so many

832
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:39,160
levels of

833
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,039
functionality um these pretzels you saw

834
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:43,239
on the uh the pretzel band a little bit

835
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,000
earlier uh and then we have our other

836
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:46,799
partner on the right that's that's

837
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,159
likewise released a pretzel but in this

838
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,280
case the hemp is really driving uh the

839
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:52,440
nutritional profile going back to the

840
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,519
fact that we don't want a lot of

841
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,280
functionality in that hemp we want it to

842
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:59,559
just have a neutral flavor and color and

843
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,440
then and then Supply you know a great

844
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:04,960
amount of nutrition we stacked various

845
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,960
uh proteins into that pretzel so that we

846
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,800
could uh uh so that we could kind of

847
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:14,159
increase the overall pcast hemp uh has

848
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,240
and Kim will speak to most of this but

849
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,679
uh you know hemp has a picast of about 0

850
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,598
65 so in many cases we'll want to Stack

851
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:25,000
other proteins in there uh to to make up

852
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,000
the difference in in

853
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,200
aminos and then yeah I'll let it I'll

854
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,960
let Kim go from here uh she'll really

855
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:34,399
just jump in and talk about the

856
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,000
nutrition awesome thank you I know I

857
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,639
already have questions for you and I get

858
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,480
to see you every day um but kind of

859
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:44,318
continuing on from this cpg highay over

860
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,440
the last couple years protein is really

861
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:49,400
King in the industry and along with

862
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,119
making protein content claims on the

863
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,639
front of packaging the FDA requires that

864
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,400
you calculate the percent daily value

865
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,118
and then put that on the nutrition fact

866
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,200
label on the back of your package and

867
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,440
the question kind of all ties into

868
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,799
protein quality and with this protein um

869
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,920
percent daily value chaek alluded to

870
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,480
pcast which stands for protein

871
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,039
digestibility corrected amino acid score

872
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,800
and so what's being corrected for is

873
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:21,519
really what still um ties into this

874
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,160
complete protein so hemp is considered a

875
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:27,079
complete protein Source meaning that it

876
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:29,759
contains all nine essential amino acids

877
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:32,640
so out of 20 total amino acids nine of

878
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,119
which have to be consumed from our diet

879
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:37,920
and protein quality now um is more than

880
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:41,039
just a number on the back of a package

881
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,200
or on the front panel it's really taking

882
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,159
two things into account it's taking into

883
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:48,000
account the composition of these

884
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:50,239
essential amino acids along with the

885
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,559
bioavailability and this digestibility

886
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:55,598
score that is um determine on how well

887
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:57,440
we're able to actually break down

888
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,800
process and utilize these amino acid

889
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,800
acids in our body so for hemp and chaak

890
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,160
already alluded to it a bit so um

891
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,119
they're able to calculate this

892
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:10,118
digestibility score so for a DEH hold or

893
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:13,400
a hemp heart it's around and the scale

894
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:16,599
is uh the max you can get is one so

895
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:20,119
dehle just regular hem seeds is at about

896
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:23,160
87 and then hemp heart flour hemp

897
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:26,599
proteins is around that 94 to 96 amount

898
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:30,239
as well so why does this matter it's

899
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:32,119
important because the fact that not all

900
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,159
proteins are considered complete

901
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,680
animal-based sources typically are but

902
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,519
plant proteins it varies and it lends to

903
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:42,039
this concept of protein stacking and how

904
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:43,639
can we combine different types of plant

905
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:45,199
proteins not only from a functional

906
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:47,639
perspective but also making sure that

907
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:50,960
we're getting um all these essential

908
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:53,400
amino acids for uh hemp in particular

909
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,318
our limiting amino acid is lysine and

910
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,960
the way I like to think about a limiting

911
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:59,480
amino acid because that's also what's

912
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,440
getting corrected in this digestibility

913
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,838
score to determine your percent daily

914
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,400
value is it um kind of like a car

915
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:10,039
analogy you could have 20 tires five

916
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,519
Motors four windshields but if you only

917
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:15,440
have one steering wheel production

918
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:17,079
ceases after that one car is made so if

919
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,440
you're not be able if you're not

920
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,839
ingesting enough of the essential amino

921
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,800
acids the building blocks for protein

922
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,358
really cease before they even begin so

923
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,039
this is really

924
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:30,880
critical um continuing on chaak has

925
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:32,759
already mentioned this ad destine so ad

926
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,920
destine is the globular seed storage

927
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,800
protein inherent to hemp and it's really

928
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,599
unique and special to hemp in particular

929
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:45,680
so it's about 65% um the remaining would

930
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:47,559
be that albumin and it the globular form

931
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:50,759
and chaak mentioned that there's some

932
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:52,759
around 70% solubility along with this

933
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,640
fact that it closely mimics the serum

934
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:58,520
globulins already in our blood so this

935
00:40:55,639 --> 00:41:00,920
resemblance upon inest in makes it

936
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:04,119
easier for a body to actually break down

937
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,480
and therefore views it to be significant

938
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:10,480
significantly lower risk of an allergen

939
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:14,159
so now as of January 2025 Sesame is now

940
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,199
the ninth top allergen per the FDA and

941
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:18,480
it really limits some of these allergen

942
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:20,960
free and gluten-free options when you're

943
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,358
trying to create a nutrient-dense

944
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:28,039
delicious food product so this um the

945
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:30,960
globular nature of the protein

946
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:32,480
is beneficial on many different levels

947
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,480
and then we have a picture here on the

948
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,760
right which is our cold pressed hemp

949
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,358
heart oil that we make at our facility

950
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,720
and you can see it's a beautiful kind of

951
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:45,838
golden yellow color and hemp oil is a

952
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,679
polyunsaturated fat so due to the double

953
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,199
uh some of the double bonds throughout

954
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:52,519
the molecule it's a little bit more

955
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,919
susceptible to oxidation and rancidity

956
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:57,800
but of that fat content about 70% of

957
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:00,800
that is omegas and it's really wonderful

958
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,960
that a plant-based product is able to

959
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,480
contribute this much Omega to the

960
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,079
overall um kind of diet from a whole

961
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,480
food source and even better it has the

962
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,280
optimal ratio of Omega-3 to omega-6

963
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,079
fatty acids so that ratio ideally would

964
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,760
be one part omega-3 to around six part

965
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,960
Omega sixes typically in the western

966
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,040
diet it's been getting um pretty well

967
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,079
known for having elevated omega-6 levels

968
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:29,199
which tip your body more into a

969
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,599
pro-inflammatory State versus when you

970
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:34,799
consume you know that ideal ratio of

971
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,519
Omega-3s into a more not necessarily

972
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,079
anti-inflammatory but it's keeping that

973
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:41,759
inflammation at Bay some of the other

974
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:44,800
seed oils and um like sunflower oil for

975
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,520
example have about 14 Parts Omega 6 to

976
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,000
one part omega-3 so whether or not not

977
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:52,239
saying that it's bad but it does tip you

978
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,480
into that pro-inflammatory kind of

979
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:57,439
reaction because when you're eating

980
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,119
anything um with omegas you're only

981
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,318
really able to uh convert 16 to 20%

982
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,880
different than an animal play u Source

983
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:07,920
but for this situation you really want

984
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,119
to make sure that you're kind of

985
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,760
stacking those Omega-3s so that you're

986
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:15,000
able to keep your body in a less

987
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,520
inflamed State and then just due to that

988
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,960
sensitive nature of the oil the smoke

989
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:22,199
point is around 320 to 330 degrees

990
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,079
Fahrenheit and making it more of a

991
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,639
culinary based oil than something you'd

992
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,680
want to cook

993
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:30,318
with next SL please

994
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:32,480
please awesome and then this is one of

995
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,759
our favorite Graphics that we've done um

996
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,599
this is so the name of the pasta that we

997
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,720
had developed previously was called prop

998
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,200
pasta and I love this this graph because

999
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:45,159
it shows a great example of protein

1000
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:47,879
stacking so in our hemp protein pasta

1001
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:50,598
there's also PE protein so it's

1002
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,280
comparing 100 grams of dried pot pasta

1003
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:56,318
to 100 grams of chicken breast and you

1004
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,359
can just see this amino acid composition

1005
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:02,079
in general is pretty balanced so there

1006
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:03,960
are ways that you can create a

1007
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,200
plant-based product that is comparable

1008
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,920
to the to um an animal Source

1009
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:10,118
highlighting that glutamic acid and the

1010
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,440
glutamine from the Flavor and Umami that

1011
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:13,400
chaik mentioned some of the alanine is

1012
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,559
really

1013
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:20,000
great and uh in in lie of time we'll

1014
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,000
just skip to the next slide as

1015
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,880
well awesome and then real quick just

1016
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,280
Trends and claims that are typical now

1017
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,720
in in the food and SE BG kosher Halal

1018
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,720
actually consumers tend to view uh a

1019
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:35,439
product that's kosher to inherently be

1020
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:39,679
more healthy whether or not that's true

1021
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,800
it's regardless um keto low carb you

1022
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:44,558
know seed oil free vegan um but one one

1023
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,920
of the topics that is near and dear to

1024
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:50,559
us is this contamination on the field

1025
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,039
for gluten so in our line of work we're

1026
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,160
always trying to be you know very

1027
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:56,480
mindful of the parts per million that

1028
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:58,920
are that of the of the hemp that we're

1029
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,639
getting that we're receiving so

1030
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,720
typically it's getting

1031
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:04,838
cross-contaminated or the field is

1032
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:07,799
getting rotated with rye wheat and

1033
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:12,440
barley so just being very aware as a

1034
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:14,760
grower and a farmer of hemp that we here

1035
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:17,280
at nepra and other food companies really

1036
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,839
um value a gluten-free Source or happy

1037
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,200
to to walk through and talk about how we

1038
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,759
might be able to collaborate on

1039
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:23,759
something like

1040
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,240
this which lends to our uh kind of

1041
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,000
called action so we would love for you

1042
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:32,719
to continue supporting brands that are

1043
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,280
using hemp in the marketplace some of

1044
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:37,078
which we were featured today educate

1045
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,359
others about the benefits of industrial

1046
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:41,519
hemp both functionally and nutrition

1047
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:43,519
wise and then this last one of research

1048
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,880
roles focus on hempy genetics is

1049
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:49,119
something that is also uh really

1050
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,200
important for us because not only are

1051
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,440
there is there opportunities to create

1052
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:57,598
hemp genetics that maybe are higher in

1053
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:00,440
protein but also kind of highlight some

1054
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,440
other varietals and chff do you have

1055
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,079
anything to to add about the genetic

1056
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,960
component yeah I think crop yield is a

1057
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:09,160
big one you know we've we've done so

1058
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,559
much genetic work around cannabinoids

1059
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:13,920
and so much work around fiber and and

1060
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:16,160
you know some great fiber varietals out

1061
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,119
there but they all only produce around

1062
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:21,639
you know 12 to to 1,700 pounds of grain

1063
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,358
per acre you know we really need

1064
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:25,239
varietals that are producing that are

1065
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:28,119
pushing the limit and producing closer

1066
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:30,078
to like 3200 to 4,000 pounds of grain

1067
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:32,640
per acre and I think that at those

1068
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,400
levels we would really see the economics

1069
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,679
begin to open up uh so obviously we're

1070
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,280
very interested in that but we're

1071
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:40,639
interested in working with groups that

1072
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,079
have these capabilities to to uh to

1073
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,039
really start pushing what you know we

1074
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:47,640
need food varietals that's really what

1075
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:50,920
we need we we need to improve on the

1076
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:54,118
size of the seed if possible um you know

1077
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,200
get get larger size more consistent seed

1078
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:58,358
uh possibly even playing with protein

1079
00:46:56,199 --> 00:47:00,679
ratios and in the in the seed you know

1080
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:02,960
if we can get higher levels of protein

1081
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:06,239
offsetting the oil perhaps you know then

1082
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,199
the uh the yields of protein uh will be

1083
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,639
higher and the economics come down

1084
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:11,279
further you know one of the things we

1085
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:15,159
didn't really talk about is the price of

1086
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,359
hemp compared to other proteins and uh P

1087
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:19,558
protein for instance is you know won't

1088
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:21,159
talk about soy because soy is subsidized

1089
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:22,559
right so it's kind of artificially low

1090
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:24,759
price if you ask me and then you got

1091
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,920
huge factories built for soy we don't

1092
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,960
really see that with the other

1093
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,039
plant-based proteins except for p p is

1094
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,400
really you know uh mass-produced but PE

1095
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,159
protein is about

1096
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,000
$350 to

1097
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:39,679
$3.75 pound and we need hemp to be on

1098
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
the same level and this is really kind

1099
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:43,000
of how we do it we do it through

1100
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,920
genetics and we do it through uh

1101
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,599
agricultural processes that are that are

1102
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,559
uh you know prone or capable of of

1103
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:53,079
yielding higher levels or higher amounts

1104
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:57,160
of

1105
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:59,720
grain and that is it so I now now we'll

1106
00:47:57,159 --> 00:48:02,199
talk but of course I talk too much so we

1107
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:06,558
don't have very many questions we can

1108
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:09,480
answer at this point but uh

1109
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:14,280
uh let's see we got the uh

1110
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:16,280
Q&amp;A yeah we have 14 questions right now

1111
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,760
so please go

1112
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,800
ahead so first question is since it's

1113
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,960
gluten-free does it rise uh like bread

1114
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,519
and wheat the answer is

1115
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,519
no um it it does because of it you know

1116
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:31,519
similarity to to the functionality of

1117
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,880
eggs you could pre-ip it you could add

1118
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:36,960
it into a batter based formula and and

1119
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,519
you could get uh you know some pretty

1120
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,079
great volume that way uh but typically

1121
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:44,039
speaking no it just it it forms a rigid

1122
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,640
structure within the bread kind of

1123
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:49,480
bolstering and holding up the uh uh you

1124
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:52,000
know the starches as they cool so you

1125
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:56,400
think about starches they gel anywhere

1126
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,760
between 165 and 175° F uh they're

1127
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,160
complet completely gelled by around 180

1128
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,720
as they come out as the bread comes out

1129
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:05,118
of the oven it's really quite soft and

1130
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:07,039
those because because there's no gluten

1131
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,079
in a gluten-free bread uh you you're

1132
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:12,119
lacking the structure so that protein

1133
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:14,119
structure sets in a rigid form and it

1134
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:15,960
prevents the starches from collapsing

1135
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:18,039
back on themselves so that's really the

1136
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,679
benefit

1137
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:24,000
there um so have you experimented with

1138
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:27,399
hemp in a bulk ferment process similar

1139
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,119
to sourdough yes and the flavor results

1140
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,798
are amazing I would definitely uh I

1141
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:34,838
would definitely try that such a mild

1142
00:49:32,798 --> 00:49:36,280
flavored protein it suits itself very

1143
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:38,960
well but there's some interesting

1144
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:41,920
flavors that are developed in this case

1145
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,679
so I would definitely try it um really

1146
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,680
really Pleasant

1147
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,480
sour uh it's this next question have you

1148
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:53,239
found that any that some industrial hemp

1149
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:57,400
seed varials are better than others

1150
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:57,399
uh you know

1151
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:04,960
yes and no um we tend to play mostly

1152
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,280
with phola uh some of our Canadian

1153
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,000
partners are producing x

1154
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,798
x59 uh you know we've gotten carola

1155
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,239
we've gotten a few others that are that

1156
00:50:11,798 --> 00:50:16,239
are uh they all seem to be fairly

1157
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:18,239
similar I've you know this is again I

1158
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:21,000
think a a huge body of work that needs

1159
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:23,439
to be done as we start identifying you

1160
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,679
know all of these strains which ones and

1161
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,240
by the way they might not be hemp

1162
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:28,519
strains that have the best levels of

1163
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:31,039
function ity I have seen some marijuana

1164
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:32,960
strains that the seeds have incredible

1165
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,358
functionality so what kind of future

1166
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,920
work could really be done around

1167
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:40,199
hybridizing and you know first of all

1168
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,280
isolating the proteins making a judgment

1169
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:44,558
around functionality chasing down which

1170
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,920
attributes might be the best for food

1171
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:50,720
systems and then uh and then and then

1172
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,318
hybridizing you know to to to get the

1173
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:56,558
appropriate uh genetics in the field for

1174
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:56,558
these purposes

1175
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,358
um next question how much time does it

1176
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,599
take for you guys to create formulations

1177
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:05,358
for other companies it's dependent on

1178
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:07,760
the formula we have thousands of

1179
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:11,159
formulas in whole just waiting for

1180
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,200
somebody to ask us for one so sometimes

1181
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:15,920
uh those formulations will be you know

1182
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:18,639
turned around very quickly average time

1183
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,480
I would say is probably you know three

1184
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:22,519
to six months to really go through the

1185
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,880
entire process if you want to include

1186
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:26,639
scale up in a factory and those types of

1187
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,880
things there's additional time that's

1188
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,759
tacked onto that and it's really just a

1189
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,960
it's a matter of going back and forth

1190
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,799
and and making sure that you know the

1191
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,559
the customer is happy with the the

1192
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:38,960
formulation first and foremost and then

1193
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,760
it goes into Consumer Testing and that's

1194
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,559
where a lot of the tweaking is done and

1195
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,160
then of course there's final tweaking

1196
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,280
done at at the

1197
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:49,519
factory oh so what hemp seed

1198
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,200
characteristics would I like uh hemp

1199
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:54,318
breeders to focus on I've kind of said

1200
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:57,199
some of this already but um I'm protein

1201
00:51:54,318 --> 00:52:01,079
content protein quality seed size yield

1202
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:01,078
per acreage those are I think the big

1203
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,280
ones uh I'm very interested in the oil

1204
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:07,319
too I'm not trying to Discount the oil

1205
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,559
at all but you know we use a lot less of

1206
00:52:07,318 --> 00:52:13,079
the oil than we do of the uh the protein

1207
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:13,079
for our specific purposes

1208
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:18,000
so

1209
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:20,239
um so this

1210
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,880
question uh did you say that the hemp

1211
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:25,318
flowers derived from the hemp hearts uh

1212
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,119
yes it is and uh it's not boiled and

1213
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:29,519
separated we don't want to to cook the

1214
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,880
Protein or else it's denatured so we

1215
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,719
want to gently separate the two so we

1216
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,680
put them in a uh we run it through a

1217
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:39,159
colloidal Mill basically uh or sheer

1218
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:42,879
mixer and then we we uh you know create

1219
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:44,838
essentially a wet puree of of hemp uh

1220
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,400
hemp solids and water and then of course

1221
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:48,920
the oil starts to separate and then we

1222
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,760
use enzymes to further get out uh

1223
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,680
release the oil we we um you know these

1224
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,319
are all done at lower temperatures right

1225
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:57,239
because we're trying to maintain the

1226
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:59,159
functionality of the protein

1227
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:00,838
and so it's a very gentle process that

1228
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:03,358
we're going through and that's really

1229
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:06,480
what's important here uh try to treat

1230
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,480
the pro the protein

1231
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:11,598
appropriately uh separating the ad

1232
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,040
destine and albumin well I don't really

1233
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,640
go through that separation but we've

1234
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:18,079
talked about it albin's water soluble so

1235
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:20,639
there's that but ad destine is salt

1236
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,798
soluble so you can actually extract the

1237
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:26,039
you can get the Destin to bind to the

1238
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:28,440
salts and then the the album will stay

1239
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:30,400
um it'll precipitate out at that point

1240
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,838
you can separate it the albumin stays in

1241
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,760
the water and then you can go through a

1242
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:36,239
drying process for that if you wish so

1243
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,960
that's the simp that's the simple answer

1244
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:42,279
it's a little more complicated than that

1245
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:46,760
but uh um salt precipitation is the

1246
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:50,119
answer so um what is the Omega 3 to6

1247
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:54,599
ratio it's about 3: one uh so you got

1248
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:54,599
three parts LA to uh one part

1249
00:53:55,039 --> 00:54:00,599
ala a menu manufacture the hemp oil and

1250
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,599
protein I also make the hemp feed for

1251
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:07,440
laying hands oh cool

1252
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:09,079
um I have not really delved into animal

1253
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,880
nutrition so I don't I'm not very well

1254
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,599
equipped to answer that question

1255
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,358
unfortunately uh but I've got some

1256
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:17,240
friends in the San Louis Valley here in

1257
00:54:14,358 --> 00:54:20,519
Colorado that are doing uh that are

1258
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:24,558
making feed for hens and uh uh they're

1259
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:26,920
growing varietal of phola so and then uh

1260
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:29,200
we've got a company here in colge New

1261
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,159
West genetics and they have introduced a

1262
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,679
new strain into the marketplace called

1263
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:35,480
amplify and I've seen lots of farmers in

1264
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:38,358
the State trying to play with that one

1265
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:40,679
so I think it's just you know trying to

1266
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:44,078
identify new varials is is going to be

1267
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:46,159
important um specifically too for the

1268
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,400
latitudes where these Pro these products

1269
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:50,399
are being

1270
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,400
grown

1271
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,838
um so when I uh this question is good

1272
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:59,078
because I mentioned 4,000 pounds of

1273
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:02,759
grain per acre so that is for the whole

1274
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:05,599
grain ho on assuming that once we dehull

1275
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,559
it you know we're losing about 40 to 50%

1276
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,640
of the weight uh I'd like to see a

1277
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:11,200
larger seed size so that that ratio goes

1278
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,920
down so we're getting larger hearts in

1279
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:15,358
relation to the to the hole I think

1280
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:20,358
that's very important um but then I

1281
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:22,078
expect I uh uh you know based on that

1282
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:24,480
then we're looking at about once we've

1283
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,400
taken the oil out which is again 50% of

1284
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,440
the heart so you know you're losing 40

1285
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,480
to 50% of the hull off the top the

1286
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:33,798
weight there and then you're taking half

1287
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,760
of the uh heart is oil so you're only

1288
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:38,639
left with about 34% protein at the end

1289
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,319
of it so those are the ratios that I'd

1290
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,318
like to see increased more

1291
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:49,000
protein yeah so this question is around

1292
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:51,480
U the uh the egg market and the Aven flu

1293
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,039
and are we seeing ingredient demand for

1294
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,760
egg replacement yes that is the short

1295
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:59,200
answer yes we are and you know know that

1296
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,400
hemp will do this effectively and you

1297
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:04,000
know you can modify uh you there's

1298
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,680
ultrasonic you know cross linking there

1299
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,440
there's other processes for

1300
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:11,000
cross-linking uh you know proteins and

1301
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,798
and uh you can fully solubilize the hemp

1302
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,599
there's a lot of really cool things that

1303
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:17,239
you can do with it to enhance the level

1304
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:19,838
of functionality and make it uh better

1305
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:21,679
for egg replacement and we we have not

1306
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:23,960
really concentrated very much on this

1307
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:26,960
but we have played a little bit around

1308
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:29,400
actual egg replacement for home Cooks uh

1309
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,039
being able to form a liquid similar to

1310
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:34,760
like just eggs uh formulation they use

1311
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:37,280
of course mung bean Protein that's been

1312
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,000
hydrolized um we have played a little

1313
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,960
bit with hemp proteins in this regard

1314
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:46,798
and we've had amazing results uh really

1315
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,720
really great textures soft creamy gels

1316
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:51,199
that uh that have a very very pleasant

1317
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:53,639
flavor at the same time without any uh

1318
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,639
flavor

1319
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:58,759
additions um the highest cooking

1320
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:00,880
temperature for Powder and oil with the

1321
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:04,200
oil I'd be very careful I would not deep

1322
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,960
fry in it to to uh to cook with it is

1323
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:09,719
fine just try to stay within that you

1324
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:12,760
know stay below the smoke point um again

1325
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:16,159
that smoke point is around 320 to 330

1326
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,680
degrees so Fahrenheit so uh we want to

1327
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:19,000
make sure that you know it stays below

1328
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:22,519
that or else you start damaging the

1329
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:26,760
omegas and that's not good so

1330
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:31,280
um the uh the the the protein itself

1331
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:33,760
uh coagulates around 170 degrees F uh

1332
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:37,720
so um I wouldn't say that there's a

1333
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,720
highend you just be concerned about

1334
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,240
burning I think of baked goods in the

1335
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,559
oven you know they'd get a little too

1336
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:46,159
dark if you're not

1337
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:49,440
careful

1338
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:52,719
um and uh yeah that's about it so I see

1339
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:55,000
a question around working with nihc no

1340
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,279
we are not currently but we do have lots

1341
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,480
of projects with you know in official

1342
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,000
capacities that we're following up on

1343
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:03,039
and obviously we're really trying to

1344
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,400
drive the hemp industry here we really

1345
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:09,039
want to see the greater industry come

1346
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:11,160
into its own um you know I want grain at

1347
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:13,760
good prices that's what I want and

1348
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:16,679
today's prices make it very difficult to

1349
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:19,720
uh to get the protein extracted in an in

1350
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:21,519
an economical way you know that I have

1351
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:24,639
to be highly cognizant as a product

1352
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:26,519
developer of what the Shelf price of you

1353
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:28,719
know the Consumer Price of these

1354
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:31,199
finished goods is going to be and if and

1355
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:33,759
if a protein is too expensive I just

1356
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:36,000
simply can't use it uh at least not to

1357
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,920
the degree that I would like to every

1358
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,239
ingredient that you use has its own

1359
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,480
relative percentage with it with which

1360
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:44,719
it's used in a formulation right and so

1361
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,760
with hemp I like it to be around that

1362
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:49,679
30% value goes all the way down to like

1363
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,359
you know half a percent as I showed in

1364
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:56,639
the example uh using it to improve the

1365
00:58:52,358 --> 00:58:59,199
mayard reaction but um you know if if I

1366
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:02,519
have a formulation where it demands 30%

1367
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:05,038
hemp I can't put it in there if it's 15

1368
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:06,759
bucks a pound so you know if I can get

1369
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:09,400
it down closer to the price of PE

1370
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:13,640
Protein that's that's really that's the

1371
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:15,559
goal well thank you so much for this

1372
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:18,838
amazing talk and for answering all of

1373
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:21,640
our questions we are wrapping up for

1374
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:24,318
today's today's webinar it has been

1375
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:26,719
recorded and we will upload it to our

1376
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:30,199
school of Integrative T science

1377
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:35,798
sips YouTube channel and I wish all of

1378
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:38,439
you a great rest of the week thank
