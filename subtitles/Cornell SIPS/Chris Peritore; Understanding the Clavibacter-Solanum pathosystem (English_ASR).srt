this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,619
University all right hi everyone thank

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,120
you for staying to the very end

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,609
hopefully I can entertain you with the

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,099
final frontier the clavo bacter solanum

6
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,570
path the system so this is and this talk

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,859
I'll give you a snippet of some of my

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,289
dissertation research that has been

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,480
unfolding over the past year and I'm

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,269
currently a fourth-year PhD graduate

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,349
student in Chris Mars lab up in Geneva

12
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:31,079
so bacterial canker of tomato is caused

13
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,488
by a gram positive pathogen called klava

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,219
bacter michigan and sis subspecies

15
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:38,128
Michigan Ensis so this is a seaborne

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,689
bacterial pathogen that can spread in

17
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:41,759
these greenhouse production facilities

18
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,099
like I'm showing through water dispersal

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,109
through mechanical inoculation and can

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,820
cause a lot of problems for growers

21
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,460
across New York State and across the

22
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,230
world so once this bacterium is inside

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,939
of the plant it spreads through the

24
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:55,919
vascular system colonizing the xylem

25
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,608
tissue and in later stages of infection

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,989
induces these stem cankers that you see

27
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:05,099
up there and as well as causing

28
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:09,719
unilateral wealth and marginal leaf

29
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,969
necrosis during kind of later stages of

30
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,908
infection as well on the fruit you can

31
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,679
form a can form these bird's eye lesions

32
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,030
that can reduce the quality of the fruit

33
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,740
and also lead to economic loss so this

34
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,849
pathogen is especially important in New

35
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,879
York because we're the number five

36
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:27,959
producer of tomatoes in the USA and a

37
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,310
lot of these Tomatoes go to fresh

38
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,938
markets so they need to be blemish free

39
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,990
it can't have these lesions and so some

40
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:36,349
of the work we're trying to do is to

41
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:38,759
support this industry in New York

42
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:40,349
importantly there is no currently no

43
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,049
known qualitative resistance to this

44
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:45,719
pathogen so we I was interested in

45
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,460
understanding tolerance to this

46
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,688
bacterial pathogen and we started by

47
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,368
looking through the literature and

48
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:52,679
finding that there were published

49
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:54,810
tolerant accessions of solanum fabric

50
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,490
IDs and Solanum Arcanum and I began

51
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,590
screening them with both wild-type and

52
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:02,209
also a hyper virulent mutinous clavo

53
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:05,100
vector and what you can see here is I

54
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:06,559
won't be able to see that is the most

55
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,179
acceptable so let's solanum lycopersicum

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,069
cultivar mountain fresh and also our

57
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,259
most tolerant accession Solanum Arcanum

58
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,949
two and five seven and what we found is

59
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,840
that the bacteria

60
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:18,119
able to colonize the tolerant accession

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,019
to a pretty high density albeit less

62
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,310
than in the most susceptible plant and

63
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:24,599
but it is impeded in its ability to

64
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,500
spread through the vascular system

65
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:30,089
vertically along with looking at kind of

66
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,969
the vascular stage of this of this

67
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,739
disease we're screening these fruit to

68
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:36,509
see if they're tolerant to the fruit

69
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,580
portion of the infection and so

70
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:41,729
currently we have a lot of data for two

71
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,010
of the four accessions us and including

72
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:45,840
the susceptible solanum lycopersicum and

73
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:46,859
also Solanum Arcanum two and seven too

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,489
different from the one I showed you

75
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,130
before and what we can see is that these

76
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,769
bird's eye lesions form on all of the

77
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,900
all of the genotypes and it's

78
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,250
interesting because anything this slide

79
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,110
I showed you before it was completely

80
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,769
asymptomatic and the vascular stage

81
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,400
however it is able to form lesions on

82
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:10,409
the fruit in that asymptomatic species

83
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,909
so this has led us to some interesting

84
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:13,799
hypotheses and directions where I'm

85
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:16,259
taking this work that I won't be able to

86
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,659
show you all the pictures I have but

87
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,189
we're looking at the the host vascular

88
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,889
morphology and how that impacts the

89
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:25,620
ability for CMM to spread between xylem

90
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,600
vessels and also vertically so we're

91
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,609
using a mix of confocal microscopy as

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,400
well as scanning electron microscopy to

93
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,709
see the colonization patterns of the

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,539
bacteria and kind of focus in on

95
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,909
individual xylem vessels and see how the

96
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,979
bacteria are able to aggregate within

97
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:43,889
those we're also interested in looking

98
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:47,189
at how the bacterium alters the host

99
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:49,560
xylem eco kind of system environmental

100
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:51,359
system whatever and we're using SAP

101
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,949
metabolomics to try to understand that

102
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:56,129
both in the tolerant and the susceptible

103
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:58,469
species so that work will be coming

104
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,689
within the next year so with that I'd

105
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:01,889
like to acknowledge my lab and everyone

106
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:04,590
that has participated in this project

107
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:08,189
and helped out a lot and Mary Jean well

108
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,569
sir help me with the SEM and I didn't

109
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:11,699
put up there but I'd also like to take

110
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:14,098
thank the RIC tomato genetics research

111
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,199
center and also USDA grant in Geneva for

112
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:17,879
providing tomato germ plasm I think we

113
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,389
have a couple seconds for questions and

114
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,389
thank you

115
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:31,660
yes yes

116
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,819
so the hyper virulent strain of cloud

117
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,939
factors so that's a knockout of an

118
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:38,889
expansion like gene from the bacterium

119
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:42,250
so it's a secreted expansion protein or

120
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:43,689
expansive like protein that still the

121
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,839
molecular mechanism that is still

122
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,839
unknown

123
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,759
all right thank you

124
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,829
