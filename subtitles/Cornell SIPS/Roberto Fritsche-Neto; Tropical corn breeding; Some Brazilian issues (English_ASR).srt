1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:10,320
University so thank you for the

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,199
opportunity uh today I would like to

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,079
show some results that you have got in

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:19,278
Brazil for tropical corn and some slides

6
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:23,159
I will show that our tropical corn is

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:27,759
not so tropical but you have work uh in

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:30,679
this species as tropical and also I

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,160
would like to present some uh uh issues

10
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:35,079
that you have in Brazil and some

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,519
perspectives for the coming future so

12
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,079
take advantage that you are paying

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,800
attention to me I don't know what you

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,640
have in the near future I would like to

15
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:46,959
introduce my my team partners and

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:51,120
support nowadays I have 10 pH students

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:54,558
working in my lab uh I don't have

18
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:58,640
Masters or I just W undergrad student

19
00:00:54,558 --> 00:01:02,920
that you call uh p

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,359
uh in iting in scientific or scientific

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,519
schoolar for

22
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:09,920
undergrads Al I also have two

23
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:14,359
technicians working with me in the main

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,759
uh the main reason uh uh that we

25
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:19,879
organize our group and you have work the

26
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:22,640
main goal of work group is tropical corn

27
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,359
for the second growing season in Brazil

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,200
you have two growing seasons in the

29
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,920
summer is the first and we call the

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,520
winter or the second growing season of

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,399
of course in Brazil we don't have a

32
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:38,560
winter if you compare like a IFA winter

33
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:42,359
we can have a fall or at least a

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,359
spring so this second grow season uh

35
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,039
have increased in the last years mainly

36
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,359
in the last 20 years and the demand of

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,960
for new hybrids for new varieties for

38
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,280
these second growes also has

39
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,679
increased so we have some uh

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,359
International Partners to develop our

41
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,079
our job so Jan luk is one of our

42
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:07,000
uh best Partners in Cornel

43
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:08,639
Universe you are here when you are not I

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,479
changed the best

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:16,079
one and S crossa is another guy that

46
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,719
have a lot of some of our projects I

47
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,640
State University jamu Michigan State

48
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,439
University Gustav delos campus and

49
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,679
andman in

50
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:29,120
Wisconsin so besides corn I also have

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,959
some projects with another companies

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,920
some private and others uh and other uh

53
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,000
the government companies for example I

54
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:43,079
have some projects with Ina in brai a

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,439
grass a forage grass that cover 9

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,200
million hectar in Brazil it's maybe this

57
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,719
is the most important crop in

58
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:55,399
Brazil mainly for beef

59
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:58,400
cattle so beans and coconut all these

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,800
projects related apply genome selection

61
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,039
trying to to improve the the scheme and

62
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,640
accelerate the the the way to select

63
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:11,079
plants I also have one project with ESC

64
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:15,000
at Cenas Institute agronom

65
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,879
and C Cafe Arabica it's a self

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,799
crop I also have projects with two

67
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:24,798
private companies one for tropical corn

68
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,599
and another sign be to support all this

69
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,239
students and

70
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:33,878
researchers uh most of my fellow ships

71
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,959
and scholarships are provided by caps

72
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,759
and

73
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:42,319
cnpk these are federal councils that

74
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,639
offer this scholarship for the students

75
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:50,318
I also have funding from fesp it's a

76
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:54,119
estadual uh Foundation only for the S

77
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:57,359
State and dupon Pioneer two years ago

78
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,280
ago I got a award called young professor

79
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Award based on my researching genome

80
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,598
selection for tropical C so since then

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,360
they have support my lab in genotype and

82
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,280
some resources and exchange some visit

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,239
des and

84
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,120
ideas

85
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,560
so a short overview about Brazilian cor

86
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:23,519
so the Brazilian corn had can be

87
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:28,560
separated into different ages until 80s

88
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:32,599
and after a8s after 8s uh we had a great

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,680
migration in the corn this migration was

90
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,120
due to new areas the government and the

91
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,280
price of the land is stimulate Farmers

92
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,879
from The Sound part of Brazil migrated

93
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:48,319
to the central areas and in these areas

94
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:51,279
the the mainly crop was

95
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:54,800
soybean but the farmers need to improve

96
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:57,000
the DOA to take advantage of the weather

97
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,400
because in that regions you can do more

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,439
than one growing season per year and

99
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,599
also

100
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:07,918
find a way to pay the machines not only

101
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,720
using on a year but if you have weather

102
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:14,240
conditions so conditions you can you

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,160
have two or three growing seasons

104
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,160
and uh divide the cost of the machines

105
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,560
for two or per

106
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:28,479
threee so this migration uh until

107
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:31,280
80s mainly 90% of corn Brazilian corn

108
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,639
was produced here then we start this

109
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:37,038
migration to this Central areas that you

110
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,360
call sados it's similar to savanas

111
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,399
African savanas this the same type of

112
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:47,120
soil the same timee of

113
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:49,918
weather uh so 20 years ago at uh

114
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,319
approximately 20 years ago the second

115
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:56,799
growing season started in for small

116
00:05:53,319 --> 00:06:00,560
farmers in this this region here and

117
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,280
became increasing year by year

118
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:08,519
until five years ago when you had a

119
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:11,399
switch the second growing season we call

120
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:15,279
safr that in Portuguese if you translate

121
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:20,598
to English it means small uh growing

122
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:24,079
season or small crop so this small

123
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:27,038
became the bigger so 5 years ago we have

124
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:29,240
the site and nowadays the most important

125
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:32,879
uh growing season for corn is the winter

126
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,879
grow it's it's the safia we call safia

127
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:39,399
so in this standings the we expect this

128
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,399
difference will increase in the coming

129
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:46,439
years uh of course we will achieve a a

130
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:48,879
certain Plateau the the summer growing

131
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:53,478
SE will not disappear but we reduce in

132
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:57,120
some areas only for the sou part of

133
00:06:53,478 --> 00:07:00,120
Brazil and nowadays you can see in the

134
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,120
central areas uh things like

135
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,918
this we have this combines harvesting

136
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,280
the

137
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,598
corn and uh sorry harvesting soybean and

138
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,038
at the same time you have some planters

139
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:15,159
sewing the corn it's common to see in

140
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,598
the central areas of Brazil when you

141
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,800
harvest the car you can plant cotton or

142
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:25,439
beans and so on so we have these

143
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:28,240
procedures uh in in almost all Farmers

144
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:32,240
big farmers in this Central

145
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,240
areas the problem is when you change the

146
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,560
growing season we change to completely

147
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:43,079
change the environment the day life and

148
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,120
also the rainfall and the temperature so

149
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:49,079
normally we plant the second growing

150
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:53,598
season in January or early February and

151
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:56,800
we will harvest this this corn in end of

152
00:07:53,598 --> 00:08:00,240
May or in the early

153
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,280
June we need that this Cor develop

154
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,000
pretty well during this first period

155
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:08,439
here onto the sewing to the flowering

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,120
time where we have a great amount of

157
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,478
rainfall and the temperature tends to be

158
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,918
stable across the year the temperature

159
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:21,120
is not a problem in these areas we have

160
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:24,158
a lot of warm normally this is the

161
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,598
average normally during the day we have

162
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:30,719
104 Fahrenheits and the problem is not

163
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:36,000
during the day the problem is at night

164
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:39,639
at night the temperature keeps very high

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,200
and more than 8 82 if you consider the

166
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:46,080
optimal temperature for corn that's near

167
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,040
to this temperature that's okay if you

168
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,200
see during the day this temperature

169
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:55,360
however if you have this at night we

170
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,759
have a lot of respiration or breathing

171
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,039
but there is no photosynthesis so the

172
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:03,439
consumption for energy

173
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:05,240
keeps in a high level and maybe this is

174
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,360
the reason that the Brazilian corn in

175
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:12,159
the central areas uh don't have doesn't

176
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:15,680
have a great heal or high he levels in

177
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,679
in the central areas and may uh for the

178
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,759
coming

179
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:22,759
years this is one of the main

180
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:26,639
interesting things to solve or to fix in

181
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:29,439
Brazilian corn change this angle or this

182
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,360
part pattern here of the respiration

183
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,760
Earth trying

184
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:39,120
that even even though the plant is under

185
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:43,600
high temperatures the respiration rate

186
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,480
uh tends to decrease faster than uh

187
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,959
normally you have seen in the tropical

188
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,039
cor so we have other issues because we

189
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:55,078
migrate the area change the soil change

190
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,399
the weather change the period of the

191
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:01,599
year so we have other ises one of these

192
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,919
is price is did it now we have this

193
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,120
problems because we compete with soan

194
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:10,559
for areas we compete with other crops so

195
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,600
it's difficult to forecast what what

196
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,639
will be the amount of corn that you have

197
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:20,200
in the coming uh growing season so

198
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:22,039
sometimes Farmers plant a lot sometimes

199
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,120
uh there's no corn and

200
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:29,399
all so due to this price instability

201
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,839
some Farmers try to predict how much

202
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:36,078
much nitrogen they will spend in this

203
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:40,079
growing season so normally they put low

204
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:42,799
levels of nitrogen so when you develop a

205
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:45,519
new variety or new hybrids for these

206
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,919
Central areas these new varieties must

207
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,959
be nitrogen use

208
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:55,838
efficiency also we have a pattern of

209
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:59,319
rainfalls but something oh something

210
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,680
weird always happen this rainfall season

211
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:07,399
can be shorter or longer or just change

212
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:11,439
the period so we also need variees water

213
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:15,639
use efficient and at the same time earli

214
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,720
earli as so normally we have hybrids in

215
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:24,120
that uh in that region that front plan

216
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:27,160
to flowering time it takes 55 days 52

217
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,959
days but the idea is to reduce this this

218
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:32,439
period but uh don't

219
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:36,000
without change the

220
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,560
youth so another thing is tolerance for

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,799
high temperatures mainly at

222
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:45,078
night another thing

223
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:48,240
is until 20 years ago we have our major

224
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:50,278
part or major production in the sound

225
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,360
part of Brazil in nowadays is in the

226
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:56,720
central areas we are not sure if we

227
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,000
import new germoplasm and select these

228
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,120
new varieties for these new areas or

229
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
just move this VAR varietes for this new

230
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,919
area so one

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,120
question 20 years ago we had a temperate

232
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,559
or subtropical Geral plast and nowadays

233
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,560
we are working in central areas like

234
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:19,599
tropical areas we have we have worked

235
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,479
with correct germoplasm or just

236
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,360
companies move the germoplasm and try to

237
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,399
select something good

238
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,000
that and another problem that we have is

239
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:35,360
the Brazilian law for coar protection

240
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,639
allows that anyone anywhere can take the

241
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,639
new Vari and using your building program

242
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,399
without pay any roots without any

243
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,560
agreement without anything if I release

244
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,958
a c far J luk can take at the same

245
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:54,759
moment this my Newar and use to cross in

246
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:56,000
his program and it's necessary uh no say

247
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:00,240
thank

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,720
you no problem so BAS on that many

249
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,240
companies left uh

250
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,079
those

251
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:12,320
uh General those schemes to improve

252
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:14,319
Geral prodct for a longterm goals and

253
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,000
the idea is only recycling these

254
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,480
materials take materials uh for from the

255
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,039
other companies self the hybrid select

256
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,360
lines cross with your testers and see

257
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:30,198
what happened like a loader game in this

258
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,759
loader game the loser is the farmer

259
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:36,240
because in the last 20 years the thing

260
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:39,360
that you have seen is a plateau of

261
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,480
productivity mainly because if you s a

262
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,720
hybrid this hybrid normally was obtained

263
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,399
by a cross between two hetero groups

264
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,160
when you s this you have like a real a

265
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,480
re combinate brid line that is like a

266
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:56,759
mosaic between this heto groups it's

267
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,720
difficult to achieve the same level of

268
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:02,959
heterosis again

269
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,839
and finally is it possible to use genome

270
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,879
selection to solve this things we have a

271
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,320
fast

272
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:13,039
migration but we think the our general

273
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,959
plasma didn't change so fast so we need

274
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:18,078
a tool to do this change and try to

275
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,399
follow the same speed that this

276
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,559
migration or the problems have

277
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,679
happened to address these three things I

278
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:30,198
brought three papers that we did during

279
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:33,799
the last two years trying to figure out

280
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:35,799
what's what happened in our general plas

281
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:39,120
or what happened in Brazilian General

282
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:42,039
plas so the first thing is what's your

283
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,039
general plasma we published this paper

284
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:49,719
uh last year in PL one and try to and in

285
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:54,039
order to understand what's your general

286
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,680
CL you take you took 20 hybrids 20

287
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:59,319
hybrids that was considered the most

288
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:02,278
important hybrids in Brazilian fields

289
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,759
covering seven breeding companies from

290
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:06,559
public to private companies and these

291
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,278
hybrids representing 90% of the

292
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:13,838
Brazilian Geral

293
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:17,799
plas can be in seed sales or in the area

294
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,399
covered by these hybrids we genotype

295
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:25,399
these hybrids using the Illumina Golden

296
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,919
Gate a low dens a low deny uh panel but

297
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:32,759
I think it's necessary to cover J and

298
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:35,879
see the relation between this germoplasm

299
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:39,000
dupon uh Pioneer support to this

300
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:42,399
genotyping and we also include the N

301
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,759
parents the N that was developed here to

302
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,720
see what's the relationship between uh

303
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,959
our hybrids and between our Brazilian

304
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,720
hybrids and the parents that was used to

305
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,278
form the

306
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,079
N

307
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:01,559
so the first result show we have seven

308
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:06,159
companies

309
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:09,159
agran and agran it's it's Monsanto in

310
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:12,439
Brazil they don't use Monsanto they

311
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:14,838
select other names they have two

312
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,800
branches trying to avoid some problems

313
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:20,360
that you know that monsant is not a most

314
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:24,479
friendly

315
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:28,399
company so we see that Dow is the

316
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,720
company that in average is more related

317
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,639
with a

318
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,399
companies in average you don't have a

319
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:39,919
strong relationship between the the

320
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:44,879
companies Geral plus besides

321
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:47,479
D so when you put these hybrids and try

322
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:51,519
to figure out this structure we see this

323
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:56,199
Parts uh it's almost the same here we

324
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:58,600
have the 20 hybrids that we evaluate and

325
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:02,120
the companies the general price of the

326
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,599
compan TS to be separated so it's a it's

327
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,038
good different than we thought when they

328
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,399
try to self hybrids from the other

329
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:12,000
companies and use these lines in their

330
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,360
their gal

331
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,240
plas now

332
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:21,599
nowadays this Jal Pro is not so related

333
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,838
so as we expect it it's good we have an

334
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,279
until now we have a good amount of

335
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:29,798
genetic varability but my concern is for

336
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:32,720
the coming years if this Behavior

337
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:35,279
remain what we have in the coming

338
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,960
years my but the problem that we

339
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,639
identify is when you put these hybrids

340
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,240
with the N

341
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:47,320
parents here are the

342
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,319
Brazilian here the Brazilian hybrids are

343
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:51,879
when

344
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:55,399
you put in the population structure you

345
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:58,840
can see our Brazilian hybrids that we

346
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,080
thought that they are tropical they are

347
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,798
in the same group that in tempor in

348
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:05,960
popcorn and here you can see the

349
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:06,960
tropical lines that were using to form

350
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,880
the

351
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,240
N so as I expect the companies didn't

352
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,000
bring new germal plus they only moved

353
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,240
the germal Plus for the central AAS and

354
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,558
try to select something new so our

355
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,400
general Blas is not so tropical as we

356
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:29,279
thought so to address the SEC one the

357
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:32,960
first problem to select for e and and

358
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:35,879
floring time Grand moer as you call

359
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,919
earliness to try to select those things

360
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,679
together we did a very simple and

361
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:47,159
classical uh

362
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:51,360
paper we this it was done for uh by my

363
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:54,280
Mastery student two years ago and to

364
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,918
address this problem he used 64 breed

365
00:18:54,279 --> 00:19:00,359
lines that we call that time tropical

366
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,840
lines we evaluated distr col lines for

367
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:06,439
grain new days to flouring and grain

368
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:08,558
oyster grain new of course production

369
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,159
and days to fling in Grain

370
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:17,399
moer is in this case is they are

371
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:21,440
indicators for precocity ear so we need

372
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:24,200
one one line or one hybrid that spend uh

373
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,320
a little time to floring and when I will

374
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,640
harvest this hybrid the gr moist tends

375
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,759
to be very low

376
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,880
so we evaluate these lines during two

377
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,000
years two locations and two levels of

378
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,400
nitrogen

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,919
availability based on the phenotypes we

380
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,640
proceed with two ways to analyze this

381
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,640
data set the blub single trait and the

382
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,679
blood multi tra in the blood single

383
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,200
trait I evaluate each one of these

384
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:56,519
traits separately then I put all the

385
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:01,840
traits together and use a mood tra then

386
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:05,319
after I get I got the is blops we use

387
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,639
three ways three ways to do the

388
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:10,639
simultaneous selection the additive

389
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,759
effect giving the same weight for each

390
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,679
one of these traits Mula mock that is

391
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:20,400
the the rank uh selection index in

392
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,600
independent cooling levels to evaluate

393
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,400
what is the best scenario compare based

394
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,038
on the gains and Coincidence of

395
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,759
selection for all these traes if I

396
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:33,400
select just one per

397
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,480
time when you evaluate the correlations

398
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,280
of these trates you you can see that

399
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,440
only these to flouring and grin Mo

400
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:43,038
moisture are

401
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,320
related so it was not expect in your

402
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:50,480
general plas but this correlation is not

403
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:53,960
so strong and when you evaluate and

404
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,200
compare the the ways to predict

405
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,360
breathing values or the genotypic values

406
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:03,319
of our our hyb or lines or hybrids

407
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:06,599
you can see the BL single trade or M

408
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:08,960
trade for these traes are not so

409
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,278
different because these traits the

410
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,278
coverance between the tra is not so high

411
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:18,519
so there is no correction uh for between

412
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:20,200
the Straits in the the ranks or uh the

413
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:23,240
genotypical vales for the

414
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,080
lines on the other hand if I select

415
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:30,359
based on uh index selection rank or

416
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:34,359
curing levels I can have complete

417
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:37,879
different uh results or

418
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:40,879
ranks the best that we identify is the

419
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,200
additive model it's a good new because

420
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,240
it's the simplest this is the simplest

421
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,679
way I just need to figure out what's the

422
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:54,679
weight for each one of the traes and

423
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:59,720
when I plot this this three traits here

424
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:03,759
identify I need one line that

425
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:07,400
uh uh needs few days to flowering that

426
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:09,919
at the Harvest Time there is

427
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:14,960
uh a little amount of water in the

428
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:19,880
grains and also high levels of f using

429
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:23,319
this index uh this additive in index in

430
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:26,799
Blue uh blue single trade I could select

431
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:29,038
the best lines for this purpose so the

432
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:32,599
simultaneous selections for grain

433
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:35,919
ear and is possible and the good news

434
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:39,839
using this simple way it's the most

435
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:42,320
efficient way to do that so we have

436
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,678
nowadays a lot of markers we have a lot

437
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:48,319
of this fancy things but you can solve

438
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:50,919
some problems using classical breathing

439
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,678
tool finally genome selection for

440
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,520
nitrogen use

441
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:59,320
efficiency this paper was not published

442
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:04,720
yet we sent to crop science uh my PhD

443
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:06,200
student and with the uh Aid of crossa we

444
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,200
evaluate

445
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:16,519
739 hybrids these hybrids uh were

446
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:20,600
obtained from uh Parise uh Crossing

447
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:22,960
between 49 R lines these hybrids were

448
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:27,038
valid in two locations two nitrogen

449
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:30,360
levels for Grand new R height and we

450
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:33,440
genotype the parents using the F

451
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:38,558
Matrix uh uh

452
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:41,919
chip after quity control we had almost

453
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:45,079
54 K Snips

454
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:48,919
and the idea is to select one hybrid

455
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:53,480
that under low nitrogen conditions this

456
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:56,880
hybrid has a good performance but if in

457
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,960
that year the farmers decide oh I put

458
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,960
more nitrogen so I need one hybrid that

459
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,798
at the same time is

460
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,960
tolerant but also responsive for

461
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,558
nitrogen I have I we need hybrids that

462
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,120
these two

463
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:16,158
faces so because of this we evaluate in

464
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:18,239
two levels of nitrogen and try to figure

465
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,679
out what's the best way to proceed

466
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:26,278
genome selection under J in this case G

467
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:29,200
by locations and levels of

468
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:31,839
nitrogen so these scenarios we compared

469
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,480
three models the first model is the

470
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:37,359
simplest one the reaction Norm across

471
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,240
environment was where we have just the

472
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:42,240
environment effects as fixed effects and

473
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,480
the main effect for

474
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:50,919
genotypes the second one it's reaction

475
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:54,880
R plus G by effect as a random

476
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:58,759
effect the third is like a reg

477
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,919
regression this this the the first two

478
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:06,879
models are GBL the third one is G by

479
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:09,000
model uh where it's instead of using GBL

480
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,120
we use RR

481
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,640
BL in this model we have environment

482
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:19,439
effects as fix effects the main marker

483
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,480
effect instead of main effect for

484
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:26,240
genotypes and you have a deviation or

485
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:31,480
the effect of the G by marker

486
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:34,399
effect we also test has two kernels uh

487
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,038
the linear the most common proposed by

488
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:43,000
Van RA in 2008 and the Gan kernel

489
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:46,720
proposed last almost two years ago the

490
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,759
Gan kernel the only thing different is

491
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,319
this when you will do the kingship

492
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,158
metrix we use this

493
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:58,439
explanation between the distance uh

494
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:01,679
between each one of these individuals

495
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,000
and you divide by the median here after

496
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,440
some procedures we use this bandwidth as

497
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,558
equal one trying to avoid some problems

498
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:16,360
as like sparse uh King Chip

499
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:17,599
matrices when you use this second one

500
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:22,558
the gaan

501
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:25,398
kernel uh it's similar to air uh airh KS

502
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:28,639
method where uh that you can capture

503
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:31,519
some no additive effects so our idea

504
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,600
that using this go Shield can you can

505
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,558
have different components of Rance for

506
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:40,319
each environment and capture this not

507
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:42,359
linear uh effects or no additive effects

508
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:46,519
uh du to the

509
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:49,719
Gite the cross validation it's the part

510
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:53,440
way we use 80% of the hybrids to

511
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,640
training set the end the remaining 20%

512
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,240
for the

513
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,320
testing we use the second uh way propos

514
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,919
OS by

515
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:04,079
bur that mimics a problem face for the

516
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,200
briders we have some lines evaluating in

517
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:11,158
some environments but not in all

518
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,519
environments and we use a BGR package

519
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:16,320
it's a vision package for genome

520
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,879
selection to to run all these

521
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:23,079
analysis and the result the results that

522
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:27,640
we uh we got was pretty good for Grand

523
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:30,960
new using or plant height using that

524
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,520
model the region regression model when I

525
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,159
have the main effect for markets and the

526
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:39,879
deviation effect for markets due to the

527
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:44,000
gbi for both traits we have a great

528
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:48,080
increase in accuracy almost 80% in plant

529
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,240
height in 70% for a grand so I can

530
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:55,240
predict regardless it's in high nitrogen

531
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:59,839
low nitrogen or the location we can't

532
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:04,839
predict very well using this model

533
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:08,639
so this model using gal Kel gaan kernel

534
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:11,158
seems to be better and also in much

535
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:15,000
better than model we can predict PR well

536
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:17,039
hybrids for this condition in with low

537
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,519
nitrogen or high

538
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:24,200
nitrogen we also have work on improved

539
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:27,558
tropical inducers of hotlights when you

540
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,919
bring these inducer from SE to or

541
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:32,558
temporate areas and put in Brazilian

542
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:37,720
conditions normally the weather is too

543
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:41,319
warm so we cannot obtain any H loids so

544
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:44,159
one way is trying to cross with tropical

545
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:47,240
cor and try to select something more

546
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,640
adapted for this high level

547
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,278
temperatures we also developed some r

548
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:57,600
package I I present these two packets

549
00:28:53,278 --> 00:29:01,079
here uh this NE and B breeder NE is a

550
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:04,519
package to work with these bigger data

551
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:09,119
sets for molecular markers and B breeder

552
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:12,839
it's a uh interface with of our using

553
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:14,759
chin to teach and learn uh plant

554
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:18,278
breeding

555
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:21,200
Concepts my lab the main reason and the

556
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:25,480
main objective is qu quantitive genetics

557
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,840
and genomic studs and always we try to

558
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,038
use our general plas evaluating for

559
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:34,000
night nren using efficient and related

560
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:37,759
traits like Roots uh root traits or

561
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,759
physiological traits or so

562
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:48,000
on uh since 2004 14 we also

563
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:51,199
uh we made a agreement with a private

564
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,839
company and try to apply this hyru

565
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:58,319
phenotyping in your germoplasm and

566
00:29:53,839 --> 00:30:01,119
trying to adapt something cheap easy and

567
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,519
fast to collect this data and applying

568
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,439
the plant

569
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,640
breeding

570
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,000
uh but the main reason for all these

571
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,640
things separated is to integrate and

572
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,880
develop a new breeding

573
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,720
scheme there's no reason to study some

574
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,240
some branchs separated if you don't have

575
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,079
one way if you don't think how can I

576
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,798
integrate and reshape my breeding

577
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,439
program and transform my breeding

578
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:31,440
program some think more efficient and

579
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:34,519
something faster than

580
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,960
before so I present a lot of problems

581
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:40,278
about ril but you have many things to do

582
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,440
and you can see the problem in two in

583
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:47,200
two ways a problem can see can be seen

584
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,880
as a opportunity to I know that Brazil

585
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,000
about Brazil we have a lot of

586
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,399
misconceptions I know that Brazil is

587
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:59,079
seen a brought this bananas monkey uh

588
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:59,879
forest and a

589
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:04,439
and

590
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:09,200
so we we we can hear uh weird things

591
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:13,519
about Brazil we are Carnival soccer

592
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,960
yes uh we are all these things it's part

593
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,000
of nature our nature is part of our

594
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,120
culture the misconception is we are not

595
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,679
just this F Brazil has one some of the

596
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:30,239
best uh universities in agricultureal

597
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:33,399
college in tropical belt so we have also

598
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:37,399
in braa in braer Petras and big

599
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:40,359
companies that has have developed great

600
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:45,119
uh researches in many areas in many

601
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:47,599
fields so this the misconception is just

602
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:51,278
to summarize Brazil in this things that

603
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:53,879
is broadcast for to the rest of the

604
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:56,558
world on the other hand we have real

605
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,399
problems the real problem in Brazil is

606
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:03,720
corruption and we don't know exactly how

607
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:08,038
much money we threw away every year due

608
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:11,399
to the corruption that's our big problem

609
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:13,638
besid this political issues we have all

610
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:14,839
ingredients to be sexual uh thinking

611
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:17,199
about

612
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:20,240
agriculture because tropical areas are

613
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,558
challenging we have a great varability

614
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,599
of environment in soils these are the

615
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:30,319
Brazilian map for the weather so we have

616
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:34,759
six seven different types of weather in

617
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:37,678
just one country and this this is our

618
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:39,798
Brazilian so map you should make a blend

619
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,120
of these things imagine the amount of

620
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:47,278
environments that you that you have in

621
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:51,518
uh on hands to select and capture these

622
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:55,720
interactions also for mainly for this in

623
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:58,519
this light yellow area we can have up to

624
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:02,079
Green through uh up to three growing

625
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:05,519
Seasons so with different weather across

626
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:09,199
the year with different uh rainfall

627
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,159
different day length so we have a lot of

628
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,840
interactions also we have a great

629
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:17,519
diverse of pastes and weeds for me it's

630
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:19,720
a great source of a hypothesis it's a

631
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,399
great source of hypoth many things to

632
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:27,399
test uh and try to figure out the

633
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:29,719
problems but maybe the the better the

634
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:33,359
best advantage that you have nowadays we

635
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:37,120
have 9 million hectars that is still

636
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:39,918
available and I'm not talking about the

637
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:43,000
Amazon forest I'm talking about this

638
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,240
area here we have a great amount of land

639
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,679
that you can using for the coming

640
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:52,440
years so maybe there's no other another

641
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,278
country with the same amount of area

642
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,440
available to expand agriculture to

643
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:03,558
expand the research and all other

644
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,558
things the problem in this area is

645
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:07,638
transportation we can produce pretty

646
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:12,159
well in the tropical areas we learn

647
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:14,480
these things we know how can I do how we

648
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,599
can do these things but the problem is

649
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,519
after we produce after the production

650
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:24,960
how collect this production and drive

651
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:27,440
this production to the ports and Export

652
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,878
all these things problem this is the

653
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,398
main issue for the coming years the main

654
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:37,279
issue is will not be genetics will be

655
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:41,078
Logistics ver as your former president

656
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,399
us it to say yes we can probably in the

657
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,650
coming years we have the solution for

658
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:48,819
that thank
