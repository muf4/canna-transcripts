1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:20,118
because yeah who defining Community

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,320
great great question um and I think

3
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:24,719
Community you know we can use

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,480
sociological framing techniques which

5
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,518
I've done in the past but I think you'll

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,159
see the community come forward as we

7
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,600
move through through this so but what

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,599
I'm targeting largely is women in a

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,120
rural context and there's a lot of

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,640
private land ownership in the United

11
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:44,799
States so women are often um in ways

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,759
have opportunities to engage in climate

13
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,479
smart forestry so um yeah the community

14
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:52,320
the platform in which to reach this

15
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,759
community is women owning Woodlands

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,600
which is um there's almost I think a a

17
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:02,198
network in each um in each state and

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,000
this is backed by the US Forest Service

19
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:08,079
and the national Woodland Owners

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,680
Association so it's a great group um and

21
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:15,519
this project um with uh Patricia and the

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,360
team is um complimentary to my other

23
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,000
extension program called Forest owner

24
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:23,359
carbon and climate education program um

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,359
which is I

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,960
will it's more Broad in terms of

27
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:31,118
reaching um land owners in general in

28
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,719
the eastern US with we have about 13

29
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,799
extension institutions that uh

30
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,759
participate in contributing to this

31
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,439
program so a lot of co-creation of

32
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,040
information um climate smart forestry is

33
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:47,000
highly interdisciplinary subject matter

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,000
so I'm the social scientist I um I

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,478
contribute in that way and um we're

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,840
looking to kind of just help bring more

37
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:58,478
awareness and opportunities to Forest

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,159
land owners um so just sort of like an

39
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,000
overview this is my one slide about

40
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,399
climate smart forestry but it's really

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,718
about how to it's managing forests based

42
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,919
on their current condition so that they

43
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,639
can either address uh mitigation uh

44
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,719
climate change uh mitigation or are able

45
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:18,598
to adapt to climate change um and force

46
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:22,878
management is key here so active Force

47
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:25,799
management and um proactive planning is

48
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,679
often needed in order to implement any

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,920
sort of mitigation or adaptation

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,400
strategy and Forest are living system so

51
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:36,559
they're very Dynamic um the biggest way

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,000
to keep a forest of carbon sink is to

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,199
keep it healthy and to keep it around so

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,360
you know preventing land use conversion

55
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:47,479
and managing it um to protect Forest

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,319
health is going to uh provide positive

57
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,079
benefits into the future but it can also

58
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:54,598
be managed to sequester additional

59
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,640
carbon um that can be sold as offsets in

60
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,119
a market setting and provide income for

61
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,119
the land owner so there's all kinds of

62
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,120
opportunities

63
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:10,919
so the problem statement when it comes

64
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,200
to um women and Forest land ownership um

65
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,798
I already highlighted that private

66
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,199
Forest lands are expected to be key

67
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,840
players about 70% of forest are

68
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,000
privately owned however land ownership

69
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,360
has been um not been an opportunity for

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,479
a lot of women

71
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,840
historically um however now in the last

72
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:32,119
few Generations uh ownership of land has

73
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,360
has been um including women more and

74
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:39,200
more uh over half of couples um own land

75
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,439
and so women are you know assigned uh

76
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,438
you know ownership um but usually the

77
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:46,840
men have the primary decision-making

78
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:49,598
roles and this just has to do with

79
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,560
traditional roles once again about who

80
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,000
whose jobs are to be outside and whose

81
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,039
are to be inside and and these kinds of

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,158
things so um so women don't often have

83
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:03,318
these formative experiences in Forestry

84
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,399
um there it is not uncommon uh well so

85
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:08,399
I'll just point out that Forest land

86
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:13,158
owners are generally around 60 years in

87
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,560
age and um women frequently outlive men

88
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:20,159
so there are periods in which women come

89
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,280
into Forest ownership unintentionally

90
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,360
they can inherit land you know they can

91
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:26,399
get it from their husband more and more

92
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,639
women are intentionally buying forests

93
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,359
but this unintentional ownership is is

94
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,360
not uncommon

95
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,439
and um forested properties at the

96
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,160
highest risk of mismanagement during

97
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,879
that period of land transfer from one

98
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,479
owner to another that is where the risk

99
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,399
of um uh unsustainable Harvest or land

100
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:48,599
use conversion is Mo most likely to

101
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:51,159
occur so thinking about this we want to

102
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,479
get women involved in Forest management

103
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,160
and also thinking in a proactive sense

104
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,319
about you know uh under climate change

105
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,520
but the literature has shown with Forest

106
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,000
uh with women Forest owners is that they

107
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:04,560
have limited formative experiences low

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,038
confidence they don't feel like they

109
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,759
belong in these spaces because forestry

110
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,639
is T tend to be male dominated and

111
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,439
programs are that you know for training

112
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,000
are usually geared towards men in the

113
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:22,360
context that um they're set up in a way

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,478
where uh you know the the kind of what

115
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,439
what I want to call like power Dynamic

116
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:30,639
is more more comfortable for men than

117
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,839
for women and so moving forward we

118
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:37,120
wanted to tra create a an extension

119
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:38,719
program for women that was in a in a

120
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,199
context that was more comfortable for

121
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,960
them especially in when there's low

122
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,680
confidence and kind of feeling like you

123
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,719
don't belong and so uh I'll share with

124
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,639
you our needs assessment study we did in

125
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,720
the codesign approach um and then I'll

126
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,478
go over how we designed the program

127
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,520
itself and then give you some uh

128
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,879
information of the data we collected uh

129
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:03,719
we did this program and we set it up for

130
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,199
Pennsylvania and South Carolina and so

131
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,160
that's the co-creation process uh but

132
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,800
we've only collected data in in South

133
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,400
Carolina right now so that's what I'll

134
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:17,840
show you um so uh let's

135
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:21,038
see my um graduate student kPa nupan did

136
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,399
um uh interviews so qualitative research

137
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:26,800
with women Forest owners in the network

138
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:28,959
that we're collaborating with and to

139
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,199
understand um how they thought about

140
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:34,120
forest and how they thought about

141
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,160
climate change and um when it comes to

142
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,000
climate change women had very mixed

143
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,039
opinions and just as a reminder these

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,680
women are generally mature and Rural and

145
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,240
so relatively

146
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,038
conservative um and you know climate

147
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,478
change is a thing but it's not the most

148
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:53,360
pressing issue in their life um but what

149
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,680
do they value about their Forest they

150
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,759
really valued um that it was a system

151
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,879
that supported multiple types of um

152
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,439
living things it provided services to

153
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,639
society clean water clean air it was a

154
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,519
place that was really important for

155
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,079
family bonding and being outside and

156
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,198
being together was something that was

157
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,639
they really valued about their Forest um

158
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,038
some of the challenges were again what

159
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,918
we saw in the literature they didn't

160
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,719
really know much about Forest management

161
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:22,399
I mean even they're part of this network

162
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,560
there's this low confidence and I'm like

163
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,359
if you're part of this network you

164
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,120
probably know more than most people but

165
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,919
there was still this like concern like I

166
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,800
don't know a lot um language barri

167
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,598
meaning terminology not understanding

168
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,360
when someone says um a select Harvest

169
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,000
what does that mean and it can mean a

170
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,160
lot of different things um lack of

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,959
capital in you know investing into their

172
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,639
land that's that's pretty common in land

173
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:49,439
ownership your land rich but you know

174
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,400
cash poor and then just a lack of trust

175
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,399
like are professionals going to take me

176
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:57,079
seriously uh when I go ask them for help

177
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,959
so so this was the issue how do we bring

178
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:01,560
climate change information to this this

179
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,598
group that where climate change is not

180
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,439
that

181
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:08,639
important and so we began to I got

182
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:11,199
together with some community members

183
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,879
that are listed on the left they um we

184
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,840
sent out a a request for women to

185
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:18,759
participate in this codesign process and

186
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:20,758
we had some criteria we wanted them to

187
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,919
sort of demonstrate leadership as well

188
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,240
as some experience in in forced

189
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:28,240
ownership at least um and then the other

190
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,360
program leaders were my colleagues in

191
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,879
extension at Clemson and at University

192
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,278
of Florida as well as here at Penn State

193
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:41,679
and we had a series of meetings in which

194
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:44,600
um we shared with those Community

195
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,559
contributors um the information from the

196
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,000
needs

197
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:50,759
assessment uh the literature what the

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,759
literature says um we shared with them

199
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,600
what kind of resources are available in

200
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:57,000
extension including climate smart

201
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,480
forestry content and said you know how

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,759
can we build a program that's going to

203
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:06,879
appeal to rural women and Forest owners

204
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,360
um and so this is the the logic model I

205
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,679
just put it in there because that's how

206
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,440
we kind of built it but now the next

207
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:16,479
slides are going to kind of show you

208
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:19,600
what that Ed up ended up being so the

209
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,839
way we um designed the program was that

210
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,159
it would be on Legacy planning that was

211
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,760
something all the women pretty much get

212
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,439
behind they're all about you know

213
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,519
protecting the forest into the future as

214
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,000
well as um supporting their family uh in

215
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,200
the future as well and so making it

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,679
climate smart is just the active

217
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,879
management part of of Legacy planning

218
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,719
which involves um some legal components

219
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,120
too and communication with your family

220
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,759
members about what you want to do in the

221
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,240
future those kinds of things um because

222
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,879
a lot of them just didn't feel very

223
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,399
confident in their knowledge and

224
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:56,639
experience in Forest management um we

225
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,440
knew we had to design an atmosphere that

226
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,039
was going to be safe and comfortable so

227
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,640
we set up these objectives to provide

228
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,399
information to support understanding or

229
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,559
support knowledge language and

230
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,720
motivation around climate smart forestry

231
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:14,000
and Legacy planning so two topics we

232
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,680
kind of put them together um we provide

233
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,159
planning documents and we also give them

234
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,159
opportunities to network with peers and

235
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,879
Forestry professionals so that's what we

236
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:26,399
want them to ultimately have that it's

237
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:30,399
about you know motivation ability to

238
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,759
plan and uh being able to network with

239
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,919
professionals or kind of our end goals

240
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:38,639
so the approach we designed was to

241
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,159
Foster group discussions with women land

242
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,879
owners that are led by their peers so

243
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,159
these are spaces where there are no

244
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,919
professionals leading the conversation

245
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,799
it is the women having conversations

246
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,078
guided conversations because we train

247
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,120
one of their peers to guide it but they

248
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,519
get to look at the materials reflect on

249
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,720
them together and do group work together

250
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,679
to come up with um their plan Envision

251
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,320
for their forest and so this was

252
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:09,039
implemented over um 3 weeks and um I

253
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,839
will let you know on the logic model

254
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,639
here is what we expected to be the

255
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,560
short-term mid and long-term impacts and

256
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,919
I think this is a really important slide

257
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:20,078
because we often get this sense like

258
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,159
well an extension we need to teach

259
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:24,199
somebody how to do something and then

260
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,838
they go do it and that's impact and

261
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,360
while that is impact that's sort of like

262
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,440
they they already had to have a lot of

263
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,879
motivation already and a lot of

264
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,720
experiences already in order to take

265
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,120
action but we're not talking about women

266
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,320
who are ready to take action yet what

267
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,639
they need really is to establish their

268
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,720
values and priorities for Forest

269
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,759
management understand what is climate

270
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,519
smart forestry what is Legacy planning

271
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:53,078
like what is it um and they need to find

272
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,480
their voice they need to talk about it

273
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:59,519
and they need to be initiated into the

274
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,600
forestry uh sector into the group as

275
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,879
being seen as a legitimate contributor

276
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,639
in the conversation in this space so

277
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:10,759
it's very much about early engagement

278
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,680
strategies and initiating people into a

279
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,399
space where they historically have not

280
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:17,559
necessarily been welcomed um and so the

281
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,639
long-term impact is you know that uh

282
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:22,000
land owners are more engaged and that

283
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,959
opportunities uh to get you know

284
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,278
incentives from climate smart forestry

285
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:29,239
be they from the state or from uh

286
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,799
private sector um that those incentives

287
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,278
were more equitably

288
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:36,000
distributed so the way we had it set up

289
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:39,240
is that there

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,360
are the FY program or this this

291
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,919
particular project we

292
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:49,159
provide um the platform in which to um

293
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,759
manage these discussion groups and our

294
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:54,838
collaborators in this case it was

295
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,639
Clemson um extension services they were

296
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,639
the ones that brought the people

297
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,799
together and so just to sort of like

298
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,240
describe a little bit a little bit more

299
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,879
cogently here um we provided

300
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,919
registration services the assignments

301
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:11,120
and discussion guides the extension

302
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:13,759
resources library and evaluation of

303
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,799
their program and our collaborators at

304
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:19,039
Clemson distributed the invitations for

305
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:24,078
these uh these discussion groups within

306
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:26,120
their Network um held meeting spaces um

307
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,638
and identified forestry professionals to

308
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,679
invite and also helped to develop the

309
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,198
the material that would be read um and

310
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,638
so there's there's a lot of different

311
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:36,838
participants in this there's the

312
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,159
facilitators who are training the group

313
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,120
leaders who are you know setting up

314
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,879
discussions with the Learners the forest

315
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,399
owners and their families and um there's

316
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,278
also the forestry professionals that

317
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,039
come at the end and say you know this is

318
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:55,078
what I do and this is how you can

319
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:59,679
contact me um so it did require quite a

320
00:13:55,078 --> 00:14:01,919
bit of uh materials had to be created um

321
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,039
but the content the training part was

322
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,958
already in existing extension materials

323
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:11,159
um so it was more we had to set up the

324
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:12,879
registration we we set up a quiz to help

325
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:14,639
uh the women understand their priorities

326
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,240
for Forest management and then these

327
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,120
discussion guides so these are the kinds

328
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,278
of materials and the evaluation surveys

329
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,679
these are the kinds of materials that

330
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,078
were generated from this project and you

331
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,799
can see here in stage one we're

332
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,719
assembling the group so we use a qual

333
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,120
trick survey to um have Forest owners

334
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,480
register

335
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,320
um they got a letter of invitation from

336
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,680
their extension Network leader um and

337
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,040
said you know here's a program if you'd

338
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:41,399
like to be part of it so they come to

339
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:44,360
qualtrix and register and part of the um

340
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:46,639
qualtrix registration process included

341
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,000
uh the values Forest values quiz to help

342
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,600
them understand um their priorities and

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,559
it also was a section where they could

344
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,120
volunteer to be a peer uh group leader

345
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,039
and so they would attend a separate

346
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,759
training to prepare them for that and so

347
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,799
so here's the um quiz it's a two-step

348
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,399
quiz first they list what do they like

349
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:10,359
about their Forest so it covers a wide

350
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:15,120
variety of things um ecosystem Services

351
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:16,959
um as well as um sort of like uh climate

352
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,000
Well Community benefits meaning just

353
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:23,758
being part of the forestry community and

354
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,559
um we what they did is they listed what

355
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,639
they thought what they like about forest

356
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,078
and then what they were concerned about

357
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,839
and then we got to compare the two to

358
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,638
help them Identify some priorities

359
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,000
because if they thought it was important

360
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,560
and they were concerned about it that

361
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,039
should be at the top of their list

362
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,679
that's part of the reason why people

363
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,838
don't really start thinking about a

364
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,039
management plan they just get

365
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,000
overwhelmed like where do I start what

366
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,879
is my goal you know and this was really

367
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,839
C trying to help them uh set those

368
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:53,799
priorities so the curriculum was a

369
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:56,120
contribution from multiple institutions

370
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,719
uh Clemson um had a lot of great

371
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,278
materials just on basic Forest

372
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,480
management

373
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:06,000
uh they also have Penn State and Clemson

374
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,800
had uh resources extension resources on

375
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,399
Legacy planning uh tips for how to

376
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:14,758
conduct what it is and then tips for how

377
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,440
to to uh engage in that process and then

378
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,680
of course my program the forest owner

379
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,639
carbon and climate education program had

380
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:25,399
plenty of articles on climate smart

381
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:27,198
forestry and carbon markets and um

382
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,559
opportunities there so that's our

383
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,758
library of resources and what we do is

384
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,879
we got together and we said this is what

385
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,639
people valued in that quiz and then we

386
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,919
just basically put together a package of

387
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,759
articles for the women to read and so

388
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,198
the individual activity that the women

389
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:47,600
engaged in before the group activity was

390
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:50,318
to review the reading assignment so it

391
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,000
was just um two or three articles short

392
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:55,240
articles that they would review before

393
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,679
getting together and they met in Zoom

394
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,680
that's where we had our um group

395
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,359
discussions and and they the peer leader

396
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:04,678
would guide them through some planned

397
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,880
questions that help them kind of

398
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,480
articulate um what it is that they

399
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,439
learned what were um some of the uh you

400
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,480
know what was of interest to them and

401
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,720
then how would they like apply what they

402
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,078
learn to what their priorities are as

403
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,880
far as um on that priorities quiz um

404
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:25,838
they had a forc visioning plan where

405
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,880
they would document um their uh

406
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,038
conversations um and these were private

407
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,320
documents they aren't like you know they

408
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:34,720
could share them or not you know it was

409
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,720
really um open-ended how the group

410
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,679
wanted to engage with each other and

411
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,880
then at the end they would get to meet

412
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,919
with forestry professionals so in South

413
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,000
Carolina they got to meet with their

414
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,038
state Forester they also got to meet

415
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,119
with some forestry extension

416
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:52,558
professionals um and one carbon markets

417
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,759
person I believe so they got to see hey

418
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,678
these are real people and they all

419
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,119
happen to be women too which was nice

420
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,600
and they knew who to call like I have a

421
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,079
question about my Forest I know who to

422
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:03,639
call because I met this person and we

423
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:07,359
had an evaluation survey at the end

424
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:10,280
which is what I'll share with you now um

425
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,918
so 10 people responded to the survey and

426
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,240
I have a poster here you know I'm

427
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,000
willing to share it if anyone's

428
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,599
interested but just sort of as a summary

429
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,519
uh most people were curious they just

430
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,839
wanted to explore options which is why

431
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,558
they got involved in the discussion

432
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:24,519
groups which is great because that's the

433
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:28,119
purpose of those discussion groups was

434
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:30,798
really kind of to broaden uh their um

435
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:35,639
exposure to climate smart forestry and

436
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:38,720
Legacy planning um and

437
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,559
see this these are the scaler questions

438
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,000
that we use to measure that

439
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:46,279
Collaborative Learning Experience that

440
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,079
group work um that Collaborative

441
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:50,599
Learning Experience has both

442
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:55,439
psychological as well as academic kind

443
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:58,279
of impacts and so in the left uh table

444
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,558
here these statements um measuring

445
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:02,960
collaborative learning benefits um were

446
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:06,359
just about the conversations about

447
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,000
Legacy planning and so you know

448
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:11,199
participants felt free to communicate

449
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,519
their opinions on a scale of one to five

450
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,319
uh means score four means that generally

451
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,720
everyone agreed that they were able to

452
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:18,960
communicate their opinions once again

453
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,400
most people agreed they enjoyed

454
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,000
listening to other people's point of

455
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,640
view their understanding was

456
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,599
broadened uh they some of them felt like

457
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,600
they learned something from each other

458
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,678
and they feel more comfort able about

459
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,158
talking uh with their peers about these

460
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,038
issues in the future and so I would say

461
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,720
the Legacy planning definitely I mean

462
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:39,879
this is some challenging stuff to talk

463
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,759
about when you're going to die and who's

464
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,559
going to do what with your forest and

465
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:48,038
what do you expect from your children so

466
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:50,720
these are not light topics and so you

467
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:52,319
know the fact that they you know enjoyed

468
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,839
themselves and felt like they were able

469
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,639
to communicate is really a great impact

470
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:01,038
moving over to Forest carbon and climate

471
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,280
change again it was all above four um

472
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,240
and there was an enjoyment talking about

473
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,960
climate change it's so interesting I

474
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,079
think when we get together and have

475
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,000
these conversations there is more

476
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:13,960
optimism than kind of learning about it

477
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,319
in the news or having it pointed at you

478
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,360
but being able to verbalize your

479
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:22,158
opinions and views on um what can be a

480
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,240
challenging topic um is is really can be

481
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,080
a positive

482
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,120
experience um and so here's change and

483
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:32,199
perceived knowledge attitudes confidence

484
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,959
um once again it was on a fivepoint

485
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,880
scale and just like Patricia's um slide

486
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,319
she showed it was the score before and

487
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,280
the score after so we're looking for a

488
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:45,079
change hopefully in a positive direction

489
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:47,558
with the Legacy planning uh confidence

490
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:50,678
in understanding Legacy planning topics

491
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:53,000
increased uh you know the pleasure of

492
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,798
learning about these things increased

493
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,679
comfort about talking to their family

494
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,798
about Legacy planning um also increased

495
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,440
and making decisions in the future so

496
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:05,480
went up a whole point on a fiveo scale

497
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,480
so I would say that is really great um

498
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,880
also an increase on Forest carbon and

499
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,720
climate change topics and this one had a

500
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,400
little few more questions that related

501
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:18,519
to um to climate change uh a couple more

502
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,278
questions that related to um uh

503
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:23,359
communication to different uh categories

504
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:25,839
of people so like their Community to

505
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:29,079
their family to contributing to

506
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:32,158
mitigation and adaptation strategies

507
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:35,319
um increase in understanding increase in

508
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,720
like enjoying learning about um the

509
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:39,960
subject matter and some of the biggest

510
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,880
changes was the skills to talk to family

511
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,600
and friends about climate change and I'm

512
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,600
like that's so great because one

513
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:50,480
of we cannot move into a society that

514
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,798
addresses climate change till everybody

515
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,120
most everybody's on board and part of

516
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,839
that involves talking and right now

517
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,798
climate change is sort of like a tabby

518
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,879
word and a lot of um uh more

519
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:04,720
conservative or traditional communities

520
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,559
because it has so much uncertainty about

521
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,079
it and among other reasons so uh

522
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:11,918
encouraging people to talk about it is

523
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:14,319
just really really great okay I'm going

524
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,480
to finish up right here here's some

525
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:20,158
comments um I would say one of my

526
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,319
favorite comments is this big one here

527
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,080
where the respondent said she only

528
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,480
really thought about her forest in two

529
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:29,158
different ways but now she was looking

530
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,720
to expand to think more about

531
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,080
um in interested in the forest landowner

532
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,558
community and in habitat management

533
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,359
which is great because before she was

534
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:40,960
just uh interested in um income and

535
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:43,959
non-timber Forest Products uh the

536
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,440
comment down below here um said that her

537
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,880
brother was the one that talked to the

538
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Forester but now she's like I know some

539
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,440
stuff so um I was like great you know

540
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,558
she's entering the conversation this is

541
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,798
evidence of being willing to now enter

542
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:59,359
that conversation and then the other two

543
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:01,200
comments basic Bally are talking about

544
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,278
how they liked the system that helped

545
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,640
them set up their ideas and and and

546
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:07,880
start making a

547
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,720
plan so what we learned is that climate

548
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,520
change Solutions should help Advance the

549
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,839
values and goals of the community so put

550
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:18,839
the Legacy planning first and then built

551
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:20,399
the climate change curriculum with it um

552
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:22,639
we don't have trust issues when working

553
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,038
with women in an extension context it's

554
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,240
just that's that's not the barrier but I

555
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,720
will say there was a little bit of

556
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,880
difference in there was concerned about

557
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,960
the political agenda that came up and

558
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,559
there was a difference based on age and

559
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,400
why is it we're focusing on women and

560
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,119
this is just was an interesting space I

561
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,640
can talk more about it if you want but

562
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,359
it wasn't a really barrier but there was

563
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,240
definitely questions like why are we

564
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,119
asking women about this or being

565
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,319
involved just women's only groups you

566
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,079
know um and the last thing is don't

567
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,079
discount the value of initiating people

568
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,960
to take part in conversations so that

569
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:58,720
concludes my presentation if you're

570
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,798
interested in doing something like this

571
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,440
in uh your community I can certainly be

572
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:07,440
of help we have a system in place and um

573
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,278
this co-design process is just part of

574
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,480
the programming it's we're building it

575
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:14,759
all the time depending on which group

576
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,759
discussion groups we're working

577
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,440
with oh that was fantastic I think this

578
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:25,480
is my favorite event so far I mean just

579
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,759
even talking about providing child care

580
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,240
in order to have families come or

581
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,038
helping people find their own voice in a

582
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,720
new field of

583
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:38,200
consideration

584
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:42,480
um you these are very common

585
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,679
sensical things uh but sometimes we

586
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,599
forget them and I just I just want to

587
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:51,640
applaud you both for bringing those very

588
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:55,639
real pragmatic things to the floor so

589
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:58,799
that we can really engage the the

590
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,679
collective Force because I do think I I

591
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,359
do think there is a common sense to

592
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:06,480
climate change and and I can see that

593
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,678
you are really you both of you are

594
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,278
really beginning to nail that common

595
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:13,600
sense and so and I wish I hadn't used

596
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:18,960
the word nail but you know what I mean

597
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:21,798
um so thank you um I'll say that um I

598
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,720
this is the first time I've done any

599
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:29,278
research that's like gender specific and

600
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:33,120
uh working in this space and I think

601
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:35,558
that um it is it's so valuable because

602
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,278
um they they're they're right there the

603
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:39,398
women are right there on the forest

604
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,880
lands and all they have to do is just

605
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:45,678
say something you know you know can we

606
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,880
just think about this this way Dad you

607
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,480
know what about this brother you know

608
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:54,880
and and um it it's it's yeah once again

609
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,079
it's like defining the problem it's not

610
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,919
this huge I mean there's there there are

611
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,319
underserved communities that have

612
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,919
significant you know um

613
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:05,480
socioeconomic you know constraints but

614
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,960
then there's others that can also make a

615
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,640
real difference where it's just about

616
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,240
increasing their confidence um so that

617
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,278
was something that I've been learning to

618
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,359
appreciate is the Nuance I guess um

619
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:18,759
that's different for every community and

620
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:22,038
I really like Patricia how your your the

621
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:23,278
the the Latino Community is just so like

622
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:25,798
let's have a good

623
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,679
time let's make this a party let's make

624
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:29,519
this about family and I'm like isn't

625
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,960
that it's just different everywhere you

626
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:36,679
go um and being sensitive culturally

627
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,880
competent I guess is the word um to uh

628
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:41,600
to to make that part of the program so

629
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,278
it feels like their

630
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:46,199
program I also think it's neat Melissa

631
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,480
how you're thinking about Legacy

632
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,399
planning it hasn't really even occurred

633
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,720
to

634
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:55,798
me um how hard it is to Broach that

635
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,880
subject let alone think about how to

636
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:01,278
manage land that results from from that

637
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,679
subject or think about how to manage

638
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:06,359
that land that results from that subject

639
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,798
to have a long-term climate impact like

640
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:12,079
there's so many temporal layers which

641
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:15,278
you made very clear in your presentation

642
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:17,918
but it's also just so poignantly present

643
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,880
like the decisions that one makes and so

644
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,320
I think it's just I'm curious in terms

645
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,278
of cart and horse did you come did you

646
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:28,319
come first to the Legacy planning or

647
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,759
were you coming from climate and then

648
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:33,918
realized that Legacy planning was this

649
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:37,480
interesting um co-

650
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:39,759
jooin in a in a trajectory that needed

651
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,240
attention and sort of climate just sort

652
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,319
of came along with it it's all about my

653
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,839
collaborators so Allison m is the leader

654
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:50,759
in Legacy planning at Penn State here

655
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,639
and of course I do the carbon uh climate

656
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:54,278
stuff where you know new money is coming

657
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,919
in and we're like What is the number one

658
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:59,440
challenge of forest management obviously

659
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:01,919
it's making it financially feasible and

660
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,320
then another challenge is at that land

661
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,840
transfer forests exist on longer time

662
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:10,519
scales than humans do and I think in the

663
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:12,599
US average L tenure is around 16 years

664
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,839
now some people will own for like maybe

665
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:17,158
20 years or 30 years but that's a really

666
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:19,480
short period of time and so not thinking

667
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:23,480
about the forest for the next generation

668
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:26,079
is self-limiting and so it definitely uh

669
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,278
in the context of um yeah Forest under

670
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,158
climate change the two really did make a

671
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:32,000
lot of sense and they were just kind of

672
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,880
separated parts of extension and we're

673
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,880
like we'll put them

674
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,839
together so I see there's a question

675
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,519
from

676
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:43,599
Lynn I'm interested in doing a similar

677
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,640
approach with pollinator habitat we'll

678
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,199
be working with South Carolina 4 Youth

679
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,559
Development would' love to discuss

680
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,200
further I'm also working with Leaders

681
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,839
with Native bees in Washington would

682
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,360
love to

683
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,079
hear uh think about I would love to

684
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,398
think about how we could build

685
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,240
collaborative opportunities so Lynn

686
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,079
you're in North Carolina and in

687
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,200
Washington state am I understanding that

688
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,240
or Washington

689
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:13,080
DC with the women Community is that I'm

690
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:15,038
not sure which uh starting with the

691
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:16,398
community kind of working that way

692
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:20,359
because I know it's easy to go like we

693
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:23,759
got to support pollinators um so

694
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:25,959
defining the community I guess would be

695
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,679
helpful I think there's room for all

696
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,240
kinds of collaboration so oh yeah

697
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,679
this event has gone over time and I

698
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,359
think I'm going to put um Patricia's

699
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,759
email in the chat uh but you I think you

700
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,519
should feel confident or comfortable

701
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:45,919
contacting any of us oh yeah

702
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,278
definitely uh but I'm GNA close it out

703
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,440
because I didn't actually realize it was

704
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:52,278
4:06 and I tried to stick to our time

705
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,558
limit so everybody can move on um I just

706
