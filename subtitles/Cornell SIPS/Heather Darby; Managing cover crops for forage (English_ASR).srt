1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,009
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,960
University

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:08,298
well great thanks everyone done

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,400
hopefully you're enjoying enjoying the

5
00:00:08,298 --> 00:00:14,239
day it's been really wonderful and a lot

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,650
to learn and take in I think Tom kill

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,649
sir and I are the only two in this

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:22,820
session and we're gonna be talking about

9
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:27,288
managing cover crops for forage and I

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:30,109
will say at least I believe Tom and I

11
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:33,320
are both in some ways talking mostly

12
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:36,940
about feeding cattle and some of you may

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,198
have questions about other livestock and

14
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:40,549
maybe we can answer that and maybe

15
00:00:39,198 --> 00:00:44,750
someone else here in this room can

16
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:46,959
answer those questions too so I told Tom

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:50,359
I would try to give an introduction to

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,299
what he was gonna say so here we go

19
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,219
one of the things that I feel like

20
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:56,448
really helped cover crops take off

21
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:00,679
pretty quickly

22
00:00:56,448 --> 00:01:04,599
no let's rephrase that not quickly but

23
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:08,240
once people realized well once people

24
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,949
started cooking finally after how many

25
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,640
years we kept trying to get them to do

26
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:16,460
it Sandra I think once people realize

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,670
that they could also actually use those

28
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:22,729
cover crops as a feed source

29
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,549
you know the adoption rate really

30
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:28,640
skyrocketed for us anyway in Vermont and

31
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,829
I'm not Shh you know some of the work

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,840
that Tom did that we've done as well

33
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:36,530
people really started to look at cover

34
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,439
crops as more than a cover crop not the

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,239
cover crops aren't important but I think

36
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,569
you know many of the farmers we work

37
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:47,509
with feed and making sure you have

38
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:49,609
enough feed and high-quality feed to

39
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,380
feed those animals that are producing

40
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,840
the milk or the meat I mean that's your

41
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:56,539
top priority and really everything else

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,370
comes after that even though all the

43
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,530
other components managing the soil all

44
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,540
these things are obviously critical to

45
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,489
getting high-quality feed you know

46
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,730
everything sort of stocks that making

47
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:10,368
sure those cows can give milk you know

48
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:14,900
at least in Vermont so you know selling

49
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:17,209
cover crops has been a difficult you

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,020
know sell but again once people realize

51
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:21,080
that there was an

52
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:25,719
opportunity to gain more than just a pat

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,830
on the back things really took off and I

54
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:29,479
personally worked with a number of

55
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,640
organic dairy so I'll talk about grazing

56
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:34,639
a little bit and Tom will talk more

57
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,909
about stored feed I personally saw a lot

58
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,649
of organic dairy farmers in particular

59
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:42,169
starting to plant cover crops as they

60
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,719
were thinking about rotations to

61
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:46,909
actually extend their grazing season and

62
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,979
that's where I really started to think

63
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:51,079
about boy maybe we could get all of our

64
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:55,699
other dairy farms to think about this

65
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,560
too so I mean we've heard enough about

66
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:58,639
all the great things that cover crops do

67
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,840
so I'm not going to spend my time

68
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,669
talking about that but one of the things

69
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,240
that we saw early on when we first

70
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:10,399
started looking at double cropping John

71
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,770
Jemison and I and a few others from the

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,039
University of Maine had this project

73
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:18,550
funded through the IPM Center to look at

74
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:22,819
double cropping I think that was in like

75
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:24,500
2009 or 2010 and it was in organic

76
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:26,569
systems but this is the same in

77
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,330
conventional systems what we really saw

78
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:31,969
was one of the benefits to doing it was

79
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:35,630
just reduced weed pressure there were a

80
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:39,109
lot less weeds in the corn following a

81
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:40,699
harvest of a cover crop and so that was

82
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,850
a real benefit on top of the soil

83
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:45,649
quality benefits on top of the fact that

84
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:48,319
people were getting feed especially in

85
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,750
an organic system having a lot less weed

86
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,139
pressure was another major benefit to

87
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:57,110
the system alright so back to how we're

88
00:03:54,139 --> 00:04:00,229
working with farmers on thinking about

89
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,000
cover cropping and this is where I feel

90
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:04,699
like we still have a lot of work to do

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,340
but you know when a farmer starts

92
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:09,079
thinking about growing crops he doesn't

93
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,789
start thinking about that the day he

94
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,950
goes out with this planter or his

95
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:15,889
harvester he's thinking about that and

96
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:17,659
planning for that all the time through

97
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,839
the whole season it's not just something

98
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,090
like I'll have to all have time to make

99
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,429
that feed today you know he's really

100
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:28,399
planning this whole system out and what

101
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:31,930
we really want farmers to do is actually

102
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:34,120
plan for cover cropping well before the

103
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,860
that they actually do it and especially

104
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,590
if you're thinking about using cover

105
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,319
crops for feed you need to plan for that

106
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:43,359
okay because they really need to be

107
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,728
planted at a certain time at the right

108
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,129
seeding rate the type of cover crop you

109
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:49,719
may choose will change depending on what

110
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:53,110
you're feeding or when you want to

111
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,180
harvest it herbicide programs the

112
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,120
maturity of your corn these are all

113
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,269
things that you need to plan for to be

114
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,579
able to harvest a cover crop for feed so

115
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:06,129
we're really looking at you know the

116
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:09,069
entire year and planning that out and

117
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:11,978
having cover crops be an actual part of

118
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:14,529
your crop plan now for those of us that

119
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,959
are you know researchers scientists you

120
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:18,459
know working whatever we're doing this

121
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,709
seems like something that we would just

122
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:22,899
do but it really hasn't been that way

123
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:25,810
you know cover crops have not actually

124
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:28,299
been a part of somebody's cropping plan

125
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,910
and that's changing but we're continuing

126
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,579
to encourage that so that we're more

127
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,830
successful alright so one of the first

128
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:37,389
pieces that we've been trying to

129
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:38,859
consider for many years now I almost

130
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,569
feel like a broken record but you're a

131
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,110
new audience so you haven't heard me say

132
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:46,870
this is that we've been really trying to

133
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,150
get farmers to grow shorter season corn

134
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:53,228
to be able to get those cover crops

135
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:55,779
planted more timely now that's been a

136
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:57,310
really hard sell it's changed a lot over

137
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:59,769
the last 10 years since I started

138
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,379
talking about this people are shifting

139
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:04,990
away from really long season corn but

140
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:09,430
I've collected the same data for 14

141
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:12,009
years and it is true that the relative

142
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,439
maturity of the corn is not a good

143
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:17,770
indicator of top performance that a

144
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:20,740
short season corn can often outperform a

145
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:24,788
long season corn and it's really more

146
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:27,430
dependent upon variety selection and

147
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:30,899
less you know dependent on the relative

148
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:34,538
maturity which is the value of having

149
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:37,060
University corn variety trial

150
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:38,978
experiments and Cornell I know just

151
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,228
started doing theirs again and we're

152
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:43,629
partnering with them but really being

153
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:45,879
able to see a lot of different varieties

154
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:48,939
across a lot of different maturities

155
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,860
is important because we not only want

156
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:54,399
we not only want the farmer to choose

157
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,900
you know a 98 day mature relative

158
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,019
maturity variety but we want them to

159
00:06:55,899 --> 00:07:02,439
choose the best one so that the yield is

160
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:06,370
as high as that 108 day variety that

161
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:08,920
they used to grow okay so why here's

162
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,780
just an example but why why do we want

163
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:16,240
farmers to plant shorter season corn

164
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:18,969
so they harvest it earlier and they're

165
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,970
able to plant the cover crop at the time

166
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,100
that's best for the cover crop okay

167
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,380
so whether you're growing it for feed or

168
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,900
just you know not shouldn't I do does a

169
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,909
cover crop as a cover crop timing of

170
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:33,639
planting is very important and so this

171
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,900
is data from Vermont compiled over many

172
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,459
years but you can see the relative

173
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:39,219
maturity these are all different

174
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:41,919
varieties and then these are the

175
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,010
planting dates so we tried to plant the

176
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,900
longer season corn a bit earlier than

177
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,969
the shorter season corn but you can see

178
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,519
when we're planning corn that's kind of

179
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,550
in this 80 day range to early 90 day

180
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,979
range we can be harvesting that in most

181
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,290
years in early September that gives us

182
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,629
plenty of time to get a cover crop in

183
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,250
maybe more time than the farmer I

184
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:06,670
shouldn't say more time than they want

185
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:09,459
but even planning these what we would

186
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:12,129
call in Vermont midseason varieties buys

187
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:14,919
us enough time to get a good cover crop

188
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:18,069
established when we get into these late

189
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,750
maturing hybrids and actually in Vermont

190
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:21,699
you know we were harvesting corn into

191
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:26,319
November this year I finished chopping I

192
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:29,709
think like two weeks ago those who are

193
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,080
very late season varieties now in most

194
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:34,059
years you really want to be getting your

195
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,919
corn chopped by this time and getting

196
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:39,029
that cover crop in the ground so we've

197
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:41,500
really been promoting shortening that

198
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:46,449
maturity and I think Tom will talk about

199
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:51,419
that too no I don't think so

200
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:54,120
I think it's random yep

201
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:57,750
okay and then just average if we average

202
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,340
the harvest dates so 92 to 98 day corn

203
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,950
on average is harvest around

204
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,530
mid-september where our hundred and two

205
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,410
208 day corn this is in Vermont again

206
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:10,429
you know is is closer to the end of

207
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:14,100
September into October in most years hey

208
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:15,870
alright so the next thing we're really

209
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,680
trying to get people to focus on is

210
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,000
planning date and especially if you

211
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,979
really want to have a nice stand of

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,200
forage right you want to make sure it's

213
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,779
planted timely so that it has time to

214
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,330
grow a bit tiller and produce a lot of

215
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:33,360
biomass the next year so we've done

216
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,220
years of planting date studies and you

217
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,730
can see dry matter yield this is the

218
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:42,000
following year when this is winter rye

219
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:45,210
is planted at different dates okay so

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,730
you know you can maximize dry matter

221
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:52,860
yield the second year by planting

222
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:54,690
earlier okay now this is something a lot

223
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,110
of people observe but don't really

224
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:01,110
understand is that small grains tiller

225
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,659
so you have one plant and then from that

226
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,909
one seed they make multiple plants and

227
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:08,189
you can observe this in the field when

228
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:10,439
you plant a winter rye cover crop and

229
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,760
you see those single spikelets come out

230
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,340
of the ground and then you go back

231
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,870
hopefully you know two three weeks later

232
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,120
probably three weeks later a month later

233
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,159
and you see the whole areas filled in

234
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,710
you don't see bare ground anymore okay

235
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:26,339
now if you plant too late if you're

236
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:28,500
planting in October let's say hey what

237
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,660
ends up happening is you just see those

238
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,120
spike lights and you say oh I have a

239
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:35,009
really thin stand this year because it

240
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,210
didn't have enough time to tiller and

241
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:40,649
actually fill in okay so that's bad from

242
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,050
an environmental perspective but also

243
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:44,850
from a forage perspective because if you

244
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:48,599
don't get any tillering you have a lot

245
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:51,810
less yield the next year so that's part

246
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,279
of the importance of planting timely so

247
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:56,250
that you can reduce your seeding rate

248
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:59,279
for one thing okay and you make up for

249
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,649
that by getting more tillering and then

250
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,449
more yield the next year and then of

251
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:04,250
course you have better ground cover more

252
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,759
roots

253
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:10,278
all of those positive benefits okay so

254
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,959
tillering can account for almost 60% of

255
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:14,059
the yield so it's really important and

256
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,309
it's only gonna tell her if it's planted

257
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:18,669
timely okay so you need to get the corn

258
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:21,198
harvested get the cover crop on on time

259
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:24,169
okay and get it give it enough time to

260
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:28,338
actually grow and tiller and fill it all

261
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:30,528
right so seeding rate and we've had this

262
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:32,600
conversation over and over and over

263
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:35,480
again and we've gone up on seeding rates

264
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,540
down on seeding rates often times if

265
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,149
we're planning for forage we do tend to

266
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:44,389
plant at higher seeding rates than if

267
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:46,129
we're just cover cropping now in Vermont

268
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:48,799
you know we recommend at this point I

269
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:51,649
think we're at 75 pounds Sandra if it's

270
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,328
seated on time because that's 75 pounds

271
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:58,730
really you should get enough tillering

272
00:11:53,328 --> 00:12:01,878
to fill in but often many of our farmers

273
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:05,329
will bump those seeding rates up to get

274
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,920
more biomass for forage okay now if

275
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:09,409
you're trying to kill them kill that

276
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:12,379
cover crop through tillage next year you

277
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:14,360
likely don't want all of that biomass so

278
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:16,490
it makes sense to have a slightly lower

279
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,159
seeding rate okay but if you're trying

280
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,839
to maximize biomass you may want to

281
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:24,129
increase that seeding rate

282
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:27,410
make sure it's planted on time right and

283
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:29,269
then you have a good forage stand now if

284
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:32,088
you start thinking about this as a

285
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:33,919
forage and not just a cover crop okay a

286
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,870
lot of people don't put as much effort

287
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,599
into their cover crops as they should

288
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:41,269
people put a lot of effort into growing

289
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,310
crops and so what we're trying to do is

290
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:47,409
get people to put as much effort into

291
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:48,948
this crop as they do their other crops

292
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:54,110
alright

293
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:56,508
so variety selection these are three

294
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,579
common there's also winter barley but

295
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,409
that's not quite as common because it

296
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:02,899
doesn't overwinter very well in Vermont

297
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:04,818
it probably does here but most farmers

298
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:07,818
are growing rye triticale or wheat as a

299
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:09,889
forage crop and the thing that I want

300
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:11,990
you to notice is dry matter yields this

301
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:15,709
is actually from this year so dry matter

302
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:18,080
yields and time harvest ok so winter rye

303
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:19,759
we were getting about two tons of

304
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,700
yield and this was harvested in the boot

305
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,669
stage hey and it was harvested the 23rd

306
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:29,240
of May so if you're trying to plant corn

307
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:32,149
after this I think most farmers want

308
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,340
that to come off as soon as possible

309
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:37,490
so that then they can go in and plant

310
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:41,710
their corn right now you can see for us

311
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:44,930
triticale was about a week later and

312
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:48,259
then we was right around the same time

313
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:50,179
now Tom saw opposite of what we saw he

314
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:52,490
saw lower yields with wheat I think you

315
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:57,979
said and higher yields with the other

316
00:13:52,490 --> 00:14:02,180
crops but whatever variety we grew and I

317
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:04,490
think it was a four inch week so I don't

318
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:06,309
remember the exact varieties I don't see

319
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,360
Sarah here she worked on the project

320
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:12,109
Samantha here no she's not here either

321
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,300
okay so I mean just really I think for

322
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,519
most farmers this is what's really

323
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:19,009
important to them as well as the yields

324
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,889
but being able to get it off timely

325
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:24,169
enough have enough time to get the corn

326
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:26,000
crop in or whatever other crop they may

327
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,799
be growing after that may not be corn

328
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,009
may be soybeans may be something else

329
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:34,279
okay mmm so variety selection is

330
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:35,860
important here's some other types of

331
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,889
grains that we looked at and also

332
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:43,370
varieties so here's here on rye this is

333
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:46,009
a variety not stated triticale try Cal

334
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:48,620
zero nine nine one four one here's a

335
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:52,580
winner barley and then two types of

336
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,860
wheat and Spell okay now you can see the

337
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:58,190
difference in yields from the different

338
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,320
forage types and varieties but again I

339
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,210
think the the important thing for many

340
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,720
farmers here is right here

341
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:08,780
when are we harvesting this stuff hey so

342
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,879
with our here on rye that was harvested

343
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:13,579
about the same time as this triticale

344
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,740
variety not stated again right around

345
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,190
the third week of May and then

346
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,870
everything else was was after that and I

347
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,180
think what was really interesting is

348
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,940
that these different triticale varieties

349
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:27,739
are heading out at different times so

350
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,870
again just like we select varieties of

351
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,000
corn if we're going to grow some of

352
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:35,089
these different cover crop

353
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,240
for feed then managing variety selection

354
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:39,560
again will become really important

355
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,350
especially if we're trying to get that

356
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:44,239
feed harvested by the third week of May

357
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:47,300
we don't want to pick a late season

358
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,730
triticale to plant and end up not

359
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:52,729
harvesting until June right and then you

360
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:55,670
can see spelt with much later and then

361
00:15:52,730 --> 00:16:00,740
this year you know wheat was late as

362
00:15:55,669 --> 00:16:02,659
well these would have all been planted

363
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:08,419
like third week of September in the fall

364
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:10,669
yeah no and I think that you know that's

365
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:13,578
the interesting thing is that when

366
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:15,860
they're harvested early so whether it's

367
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:19,669
grazed or really probably up to the boot

368
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:25,459
stage we don't see a lot of difference

369
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:28,549
between species and also varieties but

370
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:31,549
as they begin to mature more those

371
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:35,059
varietal differences and also species

372
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:43,179
differences really start to show to show

373
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:44,809
but early on they don't show as much yes

374
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:49,039
exactly

375
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:51,739
yep okay so nitrogen management Tom will

376
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:55,129
talk about this as well but basically we

377
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:59,000
do see a response to fertilizing these

378
00:16:55,129 --> 00:17:01,399
winter forages in some cases and I think

379
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,500
just to take home messages would you

380
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,539
grow any other crop without considering

381
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,160
its nutrient needs and really that's

382
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:09,740
what you need to think about you know

383
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,360
and sometimes we'll see a yield response

384
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,299
from adding additional nitrogen

385
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,678
sometimes we won't but really what you

386
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,838
need to do is figure out what its

387
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,870
nutrient needs are and understand if

388
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:22,970
you're meeting those correct and really

389
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:24,739
basically what we do for the most part

390
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,870
is plant the cover crop and hope it

391
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,329
grows hay but if you're growing it as a

392
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:31,129
crop you have a very different

393
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:33,558
perspective and you wouldn't just throw

394
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,690
a crop out there without even thinking

395
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:39,470
about what it needed to eat and so it's

396
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:42,259
no different with this this was spring

397
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,860
applied yep but you know like what we

398
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:47,619
what we generally see is if the

399
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:49,750
nomen or addition to the system you're

400
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:52,750
gonna need fertility right that just

401
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:55,179
makes sense with men or whether or not

402
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:58,150
you need additional fertility that

403
00:17:55,179 --> 00:18:00,700
depends okay and I think Tom will talk

404
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:03,940
about that more and same kind of thing

405
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,769
once you start growing two crops in a

406
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,370
season you need to be thinking about

407
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:12,220
what those two crops need hey not just

408
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:14,139
your main season crop and and we see

409
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,179
farmers get into trouble with this all

410
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,030
the time they're double cropping here's

411
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:21,309
the crop nitrogen removal rate for just

412
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:24,308
a standard double crop you're looking at

413
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:25,629
an removal rate almost you know over two

414
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:27,579
hundred and fifty pounds

415
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,220
okay and most people are only

416
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:33,428
fertilizing for their corn and what ends

417
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,169
up happening is you know this cereal is

418
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:37,450
taking out almost a hundred pounds of

419
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:40,150
nitrogen and so what ends up happening

420
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,279
is their corn needs a lot more to eat

421
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,460
and if they haven't planned for that

422
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:47,009
they can run into a lot of trouble okay

423
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,200
it's caught a lot of people by surprise

424
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:51,879
where they'll take a PS NT and they get

425
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,269
back the results and it's twice what

426
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,130
they would normally do is this a benefit

427
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:59,440
or not you know growing this as a feed

428
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:02,730
okay I think Tom we'll talk about the

429
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,440
economics so this is staged harvest

430
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,839
vegetative boot milk soft dough

431
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,730
different times that you can harvest the

432
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:14,199
forage all with different quality

433
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,390
analysis and all with different yields

434
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,298
and really you know when you choose to

435
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,770
harvest this completely in your ball

436
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:23,650
court as a farmer what are you looking

437
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:26,319
for you need pasture you need feed you

438
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:28,720
need heifer feed the weather wasn't any

439
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,480
good so you ended up here instead of

440
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,819
here you know all those things happen

441
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,940
but as Tom just mentioned stage of

442
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:39,909
harvest has more impact on quality than

443
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:43,179
anything else okay

444
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,740
and this is net energy of lactation for

445
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:46,298
the different harvest stages did you

446
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,829
give me a 5 minute already and I didn't

447
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:50,918
see you

448
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:53,589
you didn't wave oh okay it's like man

449
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:57,660
don't be so subtle you know let's get up

450
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:59,939
here okay and

451
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,970
you know so again this is vegetative any

452
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,009
else and you can see its its highest

453
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,779
with a vegetative it starts to move down

454
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:09,059
when you get into the milk stage it's

455
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:11,069
actually the lowest and then it begins

456
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,750
to go up again as you get to the soft

457
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:14,720
dough stage because you're making grain

458
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,369
right you're making energy at that point

459
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,079
so the worst time really to harvest is

460
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:21,079
in the milk stage okay

461
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,020
touch on grazing a little bit we've done

462
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:28,849
a lot of studies looking at grazing

463
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:32,690
winter forages so this is in West

464
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:34,699
Swanton and you can just see cows have

465
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,350
graze this versus not so you can see

466
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:41,240
they just really like to trim off the

467
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:43,789
top leafy part what we've seen over the

468
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,099
years of doing this work is that it's a

469
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:50,809
nice way to get the cows out onto

470
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:52,969
pasture 1 to 2 weeks before you would

471
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:56,869
put them out on standard perennial

472
00:20:52,970 --> 00:21:00,019
forage pasture now this obviously is

473
00:20:56,869 --> 00:21:02,149
dependent on the year but in the study

474
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:05,569
that we conducted in Wes wantin you can

475
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:08,720
see we almost had a ton of dry matter by

476
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:10,759
the 3rd of May and this farm doesn't

477
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,839
normally put their cows out to pasture

478
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:16,579
until about the 14th 15th of May and

479
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,549
what they what we got off the pasture

480
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:22,699
that first graze you know was a small

481
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:25,399
fraction of what we had from grazing the

482
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,110
cool season forage so before they even

483
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,030
put the cows out on their normal patch

484
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:31,669
tour they were able to get about a ton

485
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:34,369
of dry matter and then start their

486
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,750
normal grazing system season for people

487
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:37,579
that graze and want to get those animals

488
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,609
out of the barn as soon as possible in

489
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:44,269
the spring this is a really nice system

490
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:47,599
to do that it also produces very very

491
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:49,910
high-quality feed and and it's actually

492
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:53,059
in some ways it seems to be a bit more

493
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:55,130
balanced than the perennial pasture

494
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:57,859
perennial pasture and the spring tends

495
00:21:55,130 --> 00:22:01,190
to be very very high in protein the

496
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:03,349
winter cereals aren't quite as high so

497
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,350
the cows actually respond quite nicely

498
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:08,569
to the winter forage and produce a lot

499
00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:10,279
of milk according to the farmers I work

500
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:12,439
with and I'll just end on forage

501
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:14,779
brassicas because these have become

502
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,110
popular and cover crop mixes but are

503
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:19,849
also very popular for grazing and

504
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:23,389
another crop that we've done a lot of

505
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:25,429
work looking at planning dates and

506
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,920
yields

507
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,200
I think really what we found over the

508
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,870
years is planning a forage Brassica by

509
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,779
mid-august is ideal to get enough

510
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:40,539
biomass to be able to graze kind of end

511
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:42,069
of October into early November okay

512
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:44,349
so don't start thinking about planning

513
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,970
your Forge Brassica September first

514
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:48,129
even though intuitively that's what you

515
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,380
would think so I think I'm probably out

516
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,720
of time so I'll end on that that's just

517
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:57,210
a system that one of our farmers uses

518
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:00,179
and I'll turn it over to Tom kill sir Oh

519
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:03,179
okey-dokey

520
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,179
yes

521
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:33,319
you mean shorter season vegetables well

522
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:36,710
I think you Altima on a team every crop

523
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:38,689
up with a cover crop system but and

524
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,980
there are vegetable producers in the

525
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,679
storm I guess I'm one of those to

526
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:44,990
actually own a vegetable farm but um you

527
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,909
know I think generally at least on our

528
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,950
vegetable farm it's very diverse and we

529
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:50,990
have crops you know coming in and out

530
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,210
all the time and so we're really

531
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:56,089
planning cover cropping for each one of

532
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,429
those particular vegetables you know

533
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:01,459
it's a really different system and I

534
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:03,110
don't know you know Pete you want to say

535
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,579
anything about what you do but I find

536
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:07,579
that we're cover cropping almost all

537
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:09,918
year long in our vegetable farm not just

538
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:15,678
at a particular time like many dairy

539
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:17,900
farms so it's pretty different but yeah

540
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,929
that works really good we have not done

541
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,259
that but we've tried to into rolled down

542
00:24:20,929 --> 00:25:01,250
stock cover crop in didn't work so well

543
00:24:23,259 --> 00:25:03,940
yes right yes yep exactly yes and so

544
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:07,159
what you're talking about is planning

545
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:09,230
thank you but no you're you're

546
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:11,539
absolutely right looking at the system

547
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,429
and saying this will fit well here and

548
00:25:11,538 --> 00:25:18,460
the you know this is my best land I want

549
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:18,460
to do this here ya know

550
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:39,779
I got the win with it by these Weller

551
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:52,450
right too far yes yeah yeah I think

552
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:54,490
that's a good point I think what we find

553
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,960
now is that even though people watch you

554
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,089
know it'd be nice to wait a little bit

555
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,700
here's our time and we're just going and

556
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:06,189
it may be a little less yield but that's

557
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:08,500
okay you know yeah it's a trade-off and

558
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,700
I think that's for at least the farmers

559
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,019
I've been working with and it's probably

560
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,269
the same with you you know it's also

561
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:15,099
given farmers another way to manage that

562
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:16,779
cover crop in the spring if it does get

563
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:18,609
a little height of them harder to burn

564
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:20,740
down harder to plow under or whatever

565
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:22,750
they're doing just I'm gonna take it a

566
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,029
speed and we saw a lot of that this year

567
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,420
with the weather that we had in Vermont

568
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:27,420
people

569
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:38,278
