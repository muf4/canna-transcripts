1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:16,250
fabulous so today I'll be talking about

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,079
my work the past couple of years that

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,690
have been here in establishing breeding

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,789
priorities and developing cultivars for

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:30,260
organic vegetable growers here in the

8
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:32,450
Northeast organic growers as I'm sure

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,899
you all know face unique challenges to

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,120
their production because of the organic

11
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:40,640
standard which was put in place in 2002

12
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:42,439
there are limitations on the sorts of

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,679
materials that organically certified

14
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:48,198
growers can use in their production so

15
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,698
there are a couple of major differences

16
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:52,299
between organic and conventional growers

17
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:55,149
one is the issue of soil fertility

18
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:59,468
without synthetic fertilizers organic

19
00:00:55,149 --> 00:01:02,210
farms are often quite nitrogen limited

20
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:04,760
though organic growers you have ways of

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,340
managing their soil fertility increasing

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,530
the nitrogen through the application of

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,049
animal manure and nitrogenous cover

24
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,180
crops it's still often the case that

25
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:17,539
there's less nitrogen available for

26
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,510
their plants and organic growers like

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,360
conventional growers face major disease

28
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,859
and pest pressures but unlike

29
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,359
conventional growers where there are

30
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:32,030
quite effective chemically based

31
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:36,650
management tools organic growers often

32
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:40,819
lack effective approved materials to

33
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:44,180
manage these these challenges and so

34
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:47,089
they're more often reliant on genetic

35
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,580
resistance to these these challenges

36
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:53,600
than conventional growers weed

37
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:58,340
management is also a big issue in

38
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,869
organic production and organic growers

39
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:04,520
also need to use organically certified

40
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:06,740
seed so so the organic farm is different

41
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:08,810
from a conventional farm but there's a

42
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:11,689
question of doing needs to be breeding

43
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,939
for organic management aren't we already

44
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:19,969
breeding for Disease resistant and

45
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:22,759
nutrient use efficient plants we are but

46
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:26,370
but when it comes to organic farms

47
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:29,429
organic production there's a difference

48
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,480
of priorities so with disease resistance

49
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,580
for example there are diseases that are

50
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,518
well-managed under conventional

51
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:41,459
production systems common buntz in wheat

52
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,930
for example has been very effectively

53
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,348
managed through the use of seed

54
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,599
treatments which are not approved

55
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:50,250
materials for organic growers and so

56
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:52,979
that's an instance where disease

57
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,199
resistant where genetic resistance would

58
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:58,318
be more important a higher priority for

59
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,768
organic growers so for organic

60
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,268
production to be particularly successful

61
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:07,409
growers need varieties that excel under

62
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:09,329
organic conditions which means that we

63
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,039
need to be trialing varieties under

64
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,379
organics management if they're meant for

65
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,780
organic growers or develop varieties

66
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:18,780
that are intended specifically for

67
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:23,250
organics so how do we develop those

68
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:27,079
varieties well one of the ways that I've

69
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:29,669
been thinking about it is a matter of

70
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:34,379
adaptability and stability under

71
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:40,229
different environments so this graph

72
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:42,629
from Finley and Wilkinson shows shows a

73
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:46,679
trial of barley varieties under

74
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:50,189
different environments and the x-axis

75
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,349
shows the mean yield of all of the

76
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:55,949
varieties in seven different

77
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:58,679
environments and then every variety

78
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:03,089
their yield in those environments is

79
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,189
plotted so so the average yield of all

80
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,900
the varieties is the dashed line here

81
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:12,449
with a slope of one and varieties that

82
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,549
that these authors label as well-adapted

83
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:18,209
or generally adapted are those that do

84
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:20,329
well under all environments do better

85
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:24,240
than average under all environment so

86
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:26,400
variety a in this instance variety B is

87
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,319
an example of a poorly adapted variety

88
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,448
it does worse than the average across

89
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:35,019
environments variety C

90
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:37,240
is a variety with low stability so it

91
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:40,478
does particularly poorly in low yielding

92
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,079
environments but well when it's when

93
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:48,610
it's in a good a good field generally

94
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:52,808
and the particularly interesting for for

95
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,729
my purposes is variety D here which is a

96
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:59,020
variety with high stability so it does

97
00:04:54,728 --> 00:05:01,568
well it does pretty well under low and

98
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:05,168
are low yielding environments but it

99
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:08,319
does it does the same generally across

100
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:12,060
those environments so the authors of

101
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:14,919
this paper conclude that selecting for

102
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,019
for high yielding varieties under high

103
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:18,490
yielding conditions if you don't know

104
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:20,348
how those varieties do under low

105
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,329
yielding conditions can result in

106
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:25,088
varieties that don't particularly do

107
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:28,838
well under those yields low yielding

108
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:32,319
environments which we can think of as

109
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:35,740
being representative perhaps of organics

110
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:39,310
management conditions so four varieties

111
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,960
that do well under good conditions those

112
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:46,079
might not be appropriate for organic

113
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:48,128
growers and dr. Kevin Murphy

114
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,188
demonstrated this again in a study that

115
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:54,430
was done in 2007 with wheat varieties

116
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:57,580
where they under in five different

117
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,338
environments looked at the yield of

118
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:02,288
these varieties under conventional and

119
00:06:00,338 --> 00:06:06,069
organic management and then ranked them

120
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:07,899
according to yield and showed showed

121
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,399
that the yield rank changed quite

122
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,560
drastically between conventional and

123
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:15,430
organic conditions suggesting that if

124
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,769
this was in a breeding program selecting

125
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,778
for the lines that did well under

126
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:23,859
conventional management would not have

127
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:26,259
resulted in in lines that were that good

128
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,149
for organic so those that did the best

129
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:29,259
under organic management were the ones

130
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:33,490
that would have been chosen under

131
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:35,408
conventional systems so there there are

132
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,149
some traits that are generally important

133
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:39,908
to organic growers those that are

134
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:41,588
dictated by the standards and then there

135
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:43,478
are traits that are region or market

136
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:45,100
specific which also need to be

137
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:46,870
considered when we supply

138
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,160
we're looking to support a particular

139
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,240
community of growers so in this instance

140
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,370
some of the work that I've done has been

141
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,949
particularly to the Northeast and

142
00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:01,920
organic growers here I spoke last year

143
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:04,839
about a report that we were writing that

144
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,390
that summed up results of a survey that

145
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:09,369
we did asking growers vegetable growers

146
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,110
here in the Northeast who were using

147
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,209
organic practices what was most

148
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,949
important to them and what the traits

149
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:17,019
were that they would like to suggest be

150
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:20,829
worked on to support their production

151
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:23,560
and so part of the reports that we put

152
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:26,409
out last August was a prioritization of

153
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:31,720
many specific crop specific trait needs

154
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:33,490
for organic growers and the top five

155
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,610
sets are listed here so those that are

156
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:39,220
under bullet point three were all deemed

157
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,199
to be as important more important than

158
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,930
four in size but not as important as one

159
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,490
and two and you can see here that

160
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,920
there's a mix of traits that are

161
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,980
specific to the climate and culture of

162
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,500
the Northeast I'll say about that so

163
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:57,450
things like stress tolerance for

164
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,949
broccoli heat tolerance for Rig Allah

165
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:02,199
resistance to diseases in high tunnels

166
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:03,670
which are increasing in prevalence we

167
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,009
here for organic growers in the

168
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:08,980
Northeast and then also traits that are

169
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:14,709
important for consumer demands like the

170
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:18,670
color and quality of lettuce so we need

171
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:21,669
to take the varieties that do well for

172
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:24,340
the growers that have the qualities that

173
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:28,689
they're looking for like flavor this is

174
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:30,250
a graph showing that growers rate flavor

175
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:34,690
as being a really important quality in

176
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:36,460
breeding efforts so we need to take

177
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,440
varieties that already do well in the

178
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,519
markets for these growers and improve

179
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,219
the traits that will help those

180
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:46,539
varieties excel under northeast organic

181
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:49,540
conditions the reports that we put out

182
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:51,599
last year we put up on ecommons and I'm

183
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:54,779
hopeful that it'll be a useful tool for

184
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,220
anyone who is interested in working on

185
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,750
developing organic varieties whether

186
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,930
that's evidence

187
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,330
like Cornell or at seed companies across

188
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:08,529
the region so I'll talk very briefly

189
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:13,530
about two efforts that I've been working

190
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:15,699
on in developing varieties for growers

191
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:17,319
here in the Northeast but generally

192
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,090
across the northern us under the

193
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,180
northern organic vegetable improvement

194
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:24,730
collaborative so one is disease

195
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:27,729
resistant high-quality delicata squash

196
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:35,080
and the other is an early blocky bell

197
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:38,620
pepper so these are one of the one of

198
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,320
the the survey results we asked folks to

199
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,259
rate the importance of different

200
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:48,220
diseases as pre as breeding priorities

201
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:50,980
one of the one of the questions we asked

202
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,269
was about powdery mildew most of the

203
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,310
people who responded to the question

204
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:56,289
said yes this is a big problem for for

205
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:57,459
us and cucurbit production this is

206
00:09:56,289 --> 00:10:05,769
something that we would like people to

207
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:08,580
focus on so i sorry so my so the

208
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:11,169
Delicato works that i've been doing i've

209
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:15,580
have been looking at powdery mildew

210
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:18,549
resistance and Cornell Bush delicata in

211
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,710
the far right bottom corner is the

212
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:24,219
source of powdery mildew resistance that

213
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:27,759
I used I a couple of summers ago crossed

214
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,379
it with a couple of commercial

215
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,919
commercial lines with higher quality

216
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:34,240
these three boxes here which have as you

217
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:37,569
can see from last year quite a lot

218
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,220
higher severity of powdery mildew and

219
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,879
the breeding lines that I've been

220
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,800
working on I was able to fix the powdery

221
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,950
mildew resistance using a capsule marker

222
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:50,409
that was developed in our lab and all of

223
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,390
those show very low powdery mildew

224
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:56,370
severity in the field which is

225
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:59,110
encouraging I also have been looking at

226
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:04,659
screening the material for bricks as a

227
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:05,590
an assay for quality and then the second

228
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:09,360
breeding project that I've been working

229
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:11,830
on is an early blocky bell pepper and

230
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,019
growers here in the Northeast or gay

231
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:17,460
vegetable growers often grow this

232
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:20,649
variety which is called ace and folks

233
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,860
have said that they they like the

234
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:26,289
variety it produces quite a lot of food

235
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,690
it produces the chair food earlier than

236
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:33,099
other varieties that they've grown but

237
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:35,350
it could use some changes in the fruit

238
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,240
shape I've heard several people

239
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:41,170
independently tell me that they think it

240
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:44,950
looks really ugly which maybe shouldn't

241
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:48,370
matter but apparently it does so so I've

242
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:51,250
been working on that and I crossed ace

243
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:54,299
to a blockier bell pepper called

244
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:58,210
Aristotle these were both hybrids and

245
00:11:54,299 --> 00:12:03,849
last year I grew f2 families which

246
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:06,850
sounds weird to say and looked for early

247
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,639
earliness in these these lines so the

248
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:12,279
parents are ace and Aristotle and this

249
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:16,269
is showing the percent of the plot that

250
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:18,639
was flowering on July 6th so ace had

251
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:21,029
already passed the 50% point and

252
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,220
Aristotle was still not really flowering

253
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:26,620
identified four lines that were almost

254
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,810
as early as ace if not earlier and then

255
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:33,220
looked for blocky fruit and have

256
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:35,919
identified two promising lines that will

257
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,050
be trailing along with the delicata here

258
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,240
in free ville and on some organic farms

259
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:42,759
here in the Northeast so in New York as

260
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,759
well as at our partner institutions in

261
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:48,250
Wisconsin Oregon and Washington through

262
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,409
Novick which I'm pretty excited about so

263
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,409
with that I would like to thank

264
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:57,129
everybody who has been helpful and there

265
00:12:53,409 --> 00:13:02,469
are many people and our funding source

266
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:05,970
of the USDA nifA with that I will maybe

267
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:12,350
take a question if which I says I can

268
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:12,350
[Applause]

269
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,660
yeah turn if you had your survey you had

270
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,669
organic growers that were certified and

271
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:27,089
non-certified there any difference

272
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:29,429
between those groups in there in there

273
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,990
there weren't really many there there

274
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:35,699
weren't any real differences between the

275
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:37,350
two we broke them up in we asked them to

276
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,990
self-identify whether they were

277
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:43,230
certified or not certified by the

278
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:47,629
non-certified were all growers who were

279
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:51,269
following NOP practices or who were

280
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:53,820
natural naturally certified not

281
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:55,169
certified but naturally labeled so they

282
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,290
were using practices that were quite

283
00:13:55,169 --> 00:14:02,250
similar we were curious to see if if

284
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:04,379
those groups had different thoughts but

285
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:11,909
but they all sort of seemed to have the

286
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:17,279
same things to say the genetics of the

287
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:21,029
Blackie shape I don't remember the names

288
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:24,720
of the genes that have been that have

289
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:26,730
been identified for fruit shape but I

290
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,230
know that there aren't many of them

291
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:33,779
controlling fruit shape that's a great

292
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:40,830
question that I'll be sure to read up

293
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:43,039
more closely on before Mike name thanks

294
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,040
mark

295
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:55,720
this has been a production of Cornell

296
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,720
University on the web at Cornell edu
