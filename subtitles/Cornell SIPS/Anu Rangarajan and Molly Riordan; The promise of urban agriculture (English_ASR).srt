1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,160
University so we're going to tell you

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:14,638
about the study we've been doing um on

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,480
behalf of USDA uh we have a Cooperative

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,239
agreement with the EG marketing service

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,880
and they were really interested in

7
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:24,598
exploring what is the role for USDA in

8
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:28,118
supporting Urban

9
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:31,839
Agriculture and um they recognize within

10
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:35,119
that that there is

11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,960
there it is um that there is this sort

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,439
of uh emerging interest well it's

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,280
actually a huge interest right now all

14
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:42,399
over the country in how do we support

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,960
and cultivate Urban Farms carry Urban

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,840
Farms there's a lot of people doing this

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,679
so what does it take for USDA to support

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,640
the growth um and there's also um uh

19
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,960
also the challenge of trying to

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,399
understand is it different or similar to

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,000
how we're trying to support farms in

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,518
rural areas um what are the unique

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,359
policy um and sort of political issues

24
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:06,118
that are facing these types of producers

25
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:09,079
and and how do we help them sort of

26
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:12,040
frame and redesign themselves to be

27
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,840
commercial and so that was where they

28
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,080
came to the small farm program and they

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,759
asked could you help us do this study

30
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,478
because the interest was around

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,118
commercializing Urban agriculture they

32
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,719
fully recognize and embrace the the fact

33
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,478
that there's a tremendous amount of

34
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,158
urban agriculture happening to Community

35
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,438
Gardens and other types of structures uh

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,479
in school Gardens and all of those are

37
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:36,279
valued but what about the idea of trying

38
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,840
to make a living farming in an urban

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,159
area what would that look like where is

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,719
it working where isn't it and um so uh

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,960
that what was interesting for us is that

42
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:48,239
you know we've been doing a lot of work

43
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,679
in the small farm program uh focused on

44
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,560
Commercial uh on Commercial Rural Farms

45
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,680
but uh for us too it's like how would we

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,159
extend our reach and support the

47
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,399
development of these types of farms in

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,680
urban areas so that's kind of how we

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,280
came into it

50
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,799
um so we had several things that we

51
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,560
wanted to be able to U look at first of

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,959
all is um what are some of the different

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,120
factors that have helped uh contribute

54
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,840
to the success or this sort of challenge

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,560
in an urban egg

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,239
environment um and what were policy

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,719
Investments or community actions that

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,519
supported the growth of these types of

59
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,318
farms when they were commercially viable

60
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,200
and then what would be sort of future

61
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:31,039
needs and ways that USDA could position

62
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:33,000
and support Urban agriculture so uh one

63
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,799
of the interesting pieces here is that

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,680
in urban agriculture you have the sort

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,040
of convergence of urban planners and um

66
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,599
activists really interested in uh issues

67
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,560
of food security issues of food deserts

68
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,598
that are all sort of clamoring to try to

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,120
figure out is there a place and a role

70
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:54,359
for urban farming in the system and so

71
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,158
um this is all part of the context for

72
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,280
why we set out to do this so uh it was a

73
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:00,719
one-year project and it's been a

74
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,039
whirlwind

75
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:08,439
We There was over 150 interviews and

76
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:10,959
then we focus in on 14 Case Farms and so

77
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:14,560
um what we really want to do is sort of

78
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,000
help USDA think about the next Farm B

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,560
with these results and so um we're going

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,759
to tell you the kinds of things that we

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,439
found in the work and then I'm sort of

82
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,199
tell you about the next

83
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,878
steps uh so one of the issues around

84
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,399
trying to Define commercial Urban

85
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,438
agriculture it's not any different than

86
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,200
trying to Define commercial farming in

87
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:33,438
general we used the cut off of having

88
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:35,878
people earn at least

89
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:37,438
$110,000 a year from the sale of

90
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:39,399
agricultural products that was sort of

91
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:41,560
our Baseline that's what your tax

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,120
exemption is based on we had no real

93
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,799
good way of doing that um but most of

94
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,920
these Farms you'll see have diverse

95
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:51,879
sources of uh diverse product mix they

96
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:54,318
go into diverse Market channels um so

97
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:56,280
they and and their income from the sales

98
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,598
of act products is pretty sizable Port

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,640
portion of their overall Farm

100
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:04,280
budget um and uh in order to do this um

101
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,518
the first job we faced was trying to

102
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,360
identify these farms and um we were

103
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,360
confident we would find commercial Urban

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,040
Farms but it was actually really

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,640
hard it was harder than you would think

106
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,079
primarily because we wanted to have

107
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,000
Farms that had uh had a few years of

108
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,560
experience at least under their belt

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,800
three years and with recently there's

110
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,079
just more and more people getting into

111
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,478
this space so we wanted them to be

112
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,079
established um they had to be willing to

113
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:30,439
sort of talk with us and share with us

114
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,319
and we had some challenges getting

115
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,120
people to trust us so we'll talk a

116
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,079
little bit about why and how that

117
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,240
happened um but then uh we wanted also

118
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,120
them to be able to share with us some of

119
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,759
their financials so that we could really

120
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,879
look at a little bit more about what

121
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,319
does it look like to be farming and how

122
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,319
to people put together their full

123
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,879
package and we also want a geographic

124
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:55,560
diversity so uh the dark greens do

125
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,959
represent the 14 cases that we actually

126
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,519
did the 14 farms and so they go from

127
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,519
east to west and south we're not very

128
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:04,519
well represented in parts of the sort of

129
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:08,198
Southeast the Deep South but we did our

130
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:10,918
best the lighter green um uh dots are

131
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,759
farms that are profiled in our study but

132
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,599
they don't represent commercial Farms

133
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,879
that's novel approaches to Urban farming

134
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,360
um or really interesting new models of

135
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,159
farming that are emerging uh and then

136
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,720
there's in the study it a couple of

137
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,360
cities that are highlighted La Baltimore

138
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,360
and Boston based on really unique

139
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,439
policiy and so one thing that that Molly

140
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,520
has done an amazing job and Molly has an

141
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,360
urban planning background and so it

142
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,038
comes from this in a from that

143
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,639
perspective and then I come at it from

144
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:44,360
the agricultural perspective and um so

145
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,079
uh one of the things that we've wanted

146
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,560
very much to do with each of these cases

147
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,000
is to really really analyze the policy

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,280
framework that supports the development

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,959
of that so included in our study is and

150
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,399
there's actually other uh resources

151
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,000
available but have help we helped

152
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,478
uncover and sort of create uh what we

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,399
hope is a more robust database of

154
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:04,839
policies that can help communities

155
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,638
support Urban

156
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,359
agriculture so I'm going to give you a

157
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,478
little bit of a background and then um

158
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,840
on the types of farms that we have in

159
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:18,038
the collection there's 14 as I mentioned

160
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:21,638
um uh split in the uh gender of the farm

161
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:23,959
manager um so male and female uh one of

162
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,519
our important components in our work is

163
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,959
having racial diversity represented in

164
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:32,038
who we talk to and who were the farm

165
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:34,079
managers um and we also wanted to try to

166
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,199
capture new Americans who are farming in

167
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,318
urban spaces and so one of our Farms is

168
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:43,199
actually burmeses was a new

169
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:45,439
American um the uh years in businesses

170
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,038
from 3 to 23 years some of these folks

171
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,918
have been at this for a long time really

172
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:51,800
well

173
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:53,758
established um on average six years in

174
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,038
terms of thinking about farm development

175
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,000
we would consider all of these people

176
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,800
beginning Farmers because uh USDA and uh

177
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,478
generally recognizes individuals who

178
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,439
have farmed for more than 10 years as

179
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,120
actually being stable Farm businesses so

180
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,000
and several of these businesses are at

181
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,079
risk and in fact one of the cases and

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,160
maybe Molly will tell us more about that

183
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,800
uh we just found out lost their land so

184
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,479
we'll talk a bit about what that means

185
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,120
for you know a commercial Urban

186
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:24,360
Farm uh the acreages of these Farms

187
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,598
range from .1 acre to

188
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,080
3.25 very

189
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:32,800
small um and uh the the year and their

190
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:36,478
ownership or access to that land um is

191
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,918
at times very tenuous but many lease

192
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,120
some own and some have some combination

193
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:42,839
of

194
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,000
that uh a mix of structures and we're

195
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,839
going to talk a little bit more about

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,199
business structure primarily because it

197
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:51,560
has real implications on income sources

198
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,520
and the actual business strategy so we

199
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,079
have uh some of these are llc's and sort

200
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,038
of similar to many of the Farms that we

201
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,439
have in rural areas but we have some

202
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:02,399
nonprofits and some Farms have split

203
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:04,000
their activities into for-profit and

204
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,439
nonprofit

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,759
entities uh the range of Revenue on

206
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:12,399
these Farms ranged from uh 11,000 to

207
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,199
it's actually wrong I mean that's wrong

208
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:18,878
yeah I'm just going to say 12,000 to 1.5

209
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:22,879
million yeah 12 to 1.5 million is the

210
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:26,759
total um uh total revenue from these

211
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,599
Farms so quite a range of income and and

212
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,479
what we'll do is sort of share with you

213
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:32,559
sort of their farming strategies and how

214
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:37,120
that plays

215
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:40,918
out so I at

216
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,200
that um I might not use both microphones

217
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,718
I think I only one you don't have to as

218
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,120
long as you're at the podium all right

219
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,760
be good I won't move um so I want to

220
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,560
walk you guys through three example

221
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,879
Farms just to kind of show you the breth

222
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,518
and diversity of the types of farms that

223
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:59,559
we um were interviewing so Karen Fresh

224
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:04,240
Garden is the farm that Anu mentioned um

225
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:06,879
um Le Leu who is the farmer is a Burmese

226
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,959
Refugee she's been in the country for

227
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:14,159
about 8 years now um and she was farming

228
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:17,199
when she was back in Burma um and when

229
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,639
she came to the states she enrolled in a

230
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,519
program called new roots for refugees

231
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:26,120
it's run by a group called um cultivate

232
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:28,879
Kansas City and they do a lot to um

233
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,039
increase the amount of local food in the

234
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,639
Kansas City the area but they do help

235
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:36,159
with this farmer training program that

236
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:39,759
assists new Americans in refining their

237
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:41,958
skills building markets and becoming

238
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,720
commercial farms in order to have their

239
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,639
own businesses and their own income to

240
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,839
increase their opportunity upon arriving

241
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:52,199
the states so Leu founds um she Farms on

242
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,760
her own land where her house is too it's

243
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,800
just a half acre in her backyard um and

244
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:59,679
she grows a little bit of everything she

245
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:02,559
grows what she calls American crops and

246
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,078
burmes crops and she sells them to

247
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,759
different markets but her primary

248
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:10,399
markets are at farmers markets she's a

249
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:12,480
two in Kansas City um and she is kind of

250
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,559
Lucky in Kansas City Kansas because

251
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,200
there aren't any policies restricting

252
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,039
Urban farming at the moment or improving

253
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,759
it for that matter but she's able to

254
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,879
operate as she needs to um but she did

255
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,600
get an nrcs equi grant that helped her

256
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,679
get a high tunnel she put up at the end

257
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,720
of last year uh which she said has

258
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:33,759
improved her her production of spin

259
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,759
immensely so um the important thing to

260
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:40,120
know about Leu and a few other people

261
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:42,639
like her is that not only is their Farm

262
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,720
important for having a commercial

263
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,680
business but it's also very important

264
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,920
for food security for the household um

265
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,278
and she says the best thing about

266
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,039
farming in the city is that we have our

267
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:53,480
own vegetables and do not have to buy

268
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:56,679
them unlike the people that she serves

269
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,839
at Market so that's one example very

270
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:01,278
small small business second one I think

271
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,160
a lot of folks in the room know is

272
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,720
Brooklyn Range um they're in Brooklyn

273
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,958
and Queens New York they were founded in

274
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,600
2008 by a group of five people who

275
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,638
wanted to experiment with growing food

276
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,759
on rooftops um they have managed to get

277
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,240
two sites like I said one in Queens one

278
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:20,120
in Brooklyn and they have a 10-year and

279
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,519
a 20-year lease which Ben planner who's

280
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,679
um the head farmer one of the

281
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,440
co-founders said is extremely important

282
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,359
because he would not think about farming

283
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,160
um on a rooftop or anywhere if he had

284
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,360
less than a 10e lease because the amount

285
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:36,838
of work and resources that need to go

286
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,480
into it um they are specializing in

287
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,279
salad greens and other things that are

288
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,399
quick succession crops that um can be

289
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,600
sold for a high value they're growing

290
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:49,600
micro greens all year round um and have

291
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,519
sales all year round as a result and um

292
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,480
not only are they doing restaurant sales

293
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,879
but they're doing a lot of other

294
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,560
additional activities they're hosting

295
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:59,679
weddings they're hosting big farm

296
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,838
dinners um and they've gotten a a lot of

297
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,159
support too not just from doing those

298
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,680
other activities but from other grants

299
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,759
and City programs that have helped them

300
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:09,879
get the resources to farm on the roof

301
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,000
because as you can imagine it's not

302
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,958
cheap to blow all that soil up onto a

303
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,958
roof but they really know um they would

304
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:20,039
like more help with distribution and to

305
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:24,078
find increasingly more favorable lease

306
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:27,799
terms to keep these businesses alive um

307
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,559
and they are cognizant of the fact that

308
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:33,039
they are not feeding the city they're

309
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:34,919
specializing in um high value crops that

310
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,919
are only going to white tablecloth

311
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,719
restaurants but that they say does not

312
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:40,159
mean that there isn't an impact because

313
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,120
they're doing all these other things

314
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,198
that they hope are improving the food

315
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,120
landscape of the city and are they also

316
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:48,479
using High tunnels they do yep and we're

317
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,360
going to talk a little bit about how

318
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,959
that season extension has impacted these

319
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,800
Farms the third one um on the total um

320
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:01,599
flip side from Karen fresh Gardens is

321
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,399
green City growers in Cleveland Ohio uh

322
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,000
it's a

323
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:11,440
3.25 Greenhouse that uses hydroponic

324
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,480
floating uh rafts to grow

325
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,880
about I forget how many pounds they said

326
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,879
last year a

327
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:24,838
lot um but they um they own the land

328
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,480
that they're on they got help owning the

329
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,760
land that they're on through the city of

330
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,839
Cleveland kayoga County

331
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,958
uh they got new market tax credits which

332
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,399
most Farms can't get but if you and if

333
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,439
you want to talk about New Market tax

334
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,519
credits let's have a different seminar

335
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
probably won't be any of these people in

336
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,679
the room because it's not that

337
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,600
interesting but they are it is a way

338
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:47,638
that controlled environment agriculture

339
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,680
Farms have been able to build out in

340
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:53,399
cities and it's not available to

341
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:55,879
soil-based Farms because Farms are

342
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,720
excluded from New Market tax credits but

343
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:00,120
it's a way that people who want to

344
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,440
develop

345
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,198
buildings can can actually um get

346
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,920
financing so that helped them to build

347
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:12,958
out their $17 million facility they're

348
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:15,360
employing 36 people um and they are a

349
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,879
Cooperative while Evergreen cooperatives

350
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,079
who founded Green City Growers is a

351
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,278
nonprofit kind of umbrella organization

352
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,000
they have three separate Cooperative

353
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:28,799
businesses that they've started in a

354
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,600
lowincome area of Cleveland in order to

355
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,359
Pro provide a suite of resources to

356
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,639
employees who come from those

357
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,399
neighborhoods to kind of lift them up

358
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,600
out of the poverty that surrounds these

359
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,879
facilities so there is a program that

360
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,278
helps them secure housing and own a home

361
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,159
in the neighborhood there's a program

362
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,278
that helps them own a car so they can

363
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,480
get to work trying to make all the

364
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:54,159
things possible to get these people to

365
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,278
work while growing a lot of butterhead

366
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,319
lettuce I think one thing that's very

367
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,879
interesting about that business is uh um

368
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,519
I don't know they identify as a social

369
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,399
Enterprise but they are and the people

370
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,000
that are working there after one year

371
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,600
can be voted in as a

372
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,720
co-owner and there's no actual return

373
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,639
yet as a

374
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,000
co-owner um but the aspiration is within

375
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,198
10 years they will actually be able to

376
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,078
they would be able to sell their share

377
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,479
of the business and have something they

378
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,198
walk

379
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,680
away so obviously these are all really

380
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:28,679
different and it was a challenge for us

381
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:31,799
to figure out how to present them how to

382
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:34,039
part this very small data set that has a

383
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,519
lot of diversity but these are just some

384
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:39,399
of the examples of how diverse it is per

385
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,198
square foot they are earning Farm sales

386
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:45,879
between 14 cents per square foot and

387
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:48,639
$12. 63 so that's a huge range um and

388
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:52,039
there are those that are focusing on

389
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:56,519
specialty crops like I said micro greens

390
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:59,198
Sprouts mushrooms um and there's also a

391
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,318
diversity of farming experience and that

392
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:04,039
have an effect on how much they're able

393
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:05,958
to yield um and we're going to talk

394
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,719
through um on just going talk through a

395
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,958
little bit of how this plays out in

396
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,720
terms of their finances in a couple of

397
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:16,000
slides um but the farm product sales for

398
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,959
these organizations these Farms some of

399
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,480
them our organizations are anywhere

400
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:23,119
between 9 and 100% of their total

401
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,079
revenue

402
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,959
so we'll see where that other those

403
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,838
other parts of the revenue come from but

404
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,359
it's worth noting

405
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,240
that there's a lot of diversity and a

406
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,480
lot of them aren't relying solely on

407
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,600
what they're selling in order to keep

408
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,800
themselves in business um and 10 of the

409
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,360
14 Farms earned a profit three are

410
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,958
nonprofit Farms but we included them in

411
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,879
this study of commercial Urban

412
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,879
agriculture for reasons that we explain

413
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:54,039
a couple of

414
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:57,679
slides um I'm going to just to give you

415
00:16:54,039 --> 00:17:00,399
an overview of what this looks like we

416
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,919
separated the farm into three categories

417
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,480
just to kind of wrap our heads around

418
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,199
the data so like I said there's some

419
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,599
nonprofits there's some for-profits

420
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,839
there people are doing all different

421
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,480
types of things so to kind of make it

422
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,480
simple we separate them into program

423
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,519
focused Farms which are those Farms kind

424
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,160
of like green City Growers where they're

425
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:22,639
trying to provide more than just food

426
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,558
there is some sort of social component

427
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,799
of their work some sort of programming

428
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,319
component of their work and often they

429
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:32,879
are nonprofit or they have a non profit

430
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:34,879
arm that enables them to get grant money

431
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,200
and individual giving in order to

432
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,520
support the programmatic work and as you

433
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,200
can see that makes up over half of what

434
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,599
they earn on average um there's

435
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,160
Diversified Farms so Farms kind of like

436
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:49,079
Brookland Grange that are growing food

437
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,000
for people to eat but they're also doing

438
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,720
a lot of other things like workshops and

439
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,200
events um and that ends up making a

440
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,038
significant portion on average of their

441
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,080
total earned revenue and then there's

442
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,720
production focused Farms which as the

443
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:06,000
name suggest focus on production um and

444
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,000
they might have a few activities that

445
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,279
happen but those are more kind of oneoff

446
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,400
events that occur and so just looking at

447
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:18,279
this these program Focus Diversified and

448
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,840
production focused Farms you don't

449
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:23,119
really get a sense of what that means in

450
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:26,079
terms of scale in terms of how much

451
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,918
they're earning and so we try to break

452
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,399
it down in different ways looking at the

453
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,159
ranges of income

454
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
and Anna is going to walk you through a

455
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,720
little bit of that information so you

456
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,720
can see what this looks like in

457
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,640
practice so we're going to focus

458
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,120
primarily in on income and sales and

459
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,038
profit and um we have aggregated the

460
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,038
data to sort of protect the information

461
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:51,119
from these Farms um so what I want to be

462
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,440
able to share with you just sort of a

463
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,759
breakdown of a total income and this is

464
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,400
a little bit of what Molly had shared on

465
00:18:54,759 --> 00:19:00,480
that previous

466
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:04,280
slide where um we have a income anywhere

467
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,279
um uh from I think

468
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:10,319
around 43,000 at the bottom all the way

469
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:12,720
up to 1 uh 3.3 million for total income

470
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,678
but we cut off the chart at 100,000 or 1

471
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,880
million there at the top and so uh the

472
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,038
total income of our largest operation

473
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,400
was 3.3 when you combine both what

474
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:23,158
they're making from agriculture as well

475
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,759
as what they're getting from grip scin

476
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:28,000
gifts grants and other

477
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:29,879
activities um so uh what's really

478
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,558
important to note is of course what's

479
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,240
really obvious the production Focus

480
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:37,599
Farms very small total uh income to the

481
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:42,000
farm very little done with um additional

482
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:44,759
activities but also um uh for the

483
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,880
majority of that earnings coming from

484
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:50,720
agricultural when we look at the uh

485
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,679
Diversified farms and the Farms that are

486
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,038
um program focused the ones that are

487
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,440
using a lot of um educational activities

488
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,879
to supplement what they're doing uh our

489
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,320
differences in the actual earnings by a

490
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,240
sales is not that different but what

491
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,359
this does allow that uh those Farms to

492
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,200
do is actually to supplement income to

493
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,678
provide I think longer term employment

494
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,279
uh for many of the individuals that are

495
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,280
working on the

496
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,839
operations um so when we uh take it then

497
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,879
and we add to

498
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,599
this um and so these are ranges so these

499
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,159
These Bars are just representing ranges

500
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,319
to give you a sense we're still trying

501
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,240
to figure out how you actually want to

502
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:33,918
represent this for USDA so so these bars

503
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,000
are basically the top and the bottom of

504
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,080
a range for a group of farms that are

505
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,400
included here and so in this business

506
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:43,038
strategy What's um interesting here is

507
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,159
at the very bottom when you actually

508
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,919
look at the orange bars which represent

509
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:50,559
the um agriculture based sales the

510
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,919
income from sales um and then the actual

511
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:53,240
profit that they declared after you

512
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,320
remove

513
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,400
expenses um when you look at those

514
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:59,960
yellow the yellow bars at the bottom you

515
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,120
can find there's very very low

516
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,480
profitability in those ones that are

517
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:06,000
program based these Farms are doing a

518
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,400
lot of things they may have really huge

519
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,278
incomes but at the end of the day the

520
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,679
total profits from those operations are

521
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:13,640
not that much different from the very

522
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,519
small production

523
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,120
ones so this was a bit counterintuitive

524
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:21,319
for us and so we're still sitting with

525
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,479
this because it is actually kind of a

526
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:28,119
surprising to think about that and what

527
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,599
you're not seeing in here is um that you

528
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:32,000
know these are all Farms of different

529
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,359
sizes with different production capacity

530
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,079
and one of the other challenges in

531
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,158
working with small farms whether they're

532
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,918
rural or Urban or any kind of small

533
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,360
business especially if it's a sole

534
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:44,159
proprietor is how does the actual owner

535
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:46,479
operator uh take a draw from the

536
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,039
business and so some of our Farms

537
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,360
actually do have pay the owner operator

538
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,798
the primary manager from the actual

539
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,678
sales of products and others don't they

540
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:58,798
just take what's profitable what's left

541
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,759
over and so that is a really difficult

542
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,359
place in as far as trying to manage and

543
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:06,359
analyze this type of information so we

544
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,719
recognize that um uh and again there's

545
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,119
also the additional draw of food that's

546
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,200
supporting food security of the

547
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:15,519
household how do you actually account

548
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,000
for that impact on a household income so

549
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,000
those are um sort of future research

550
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,720
questions additional types of inquiry

551
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,919
that have to happen but we're beyond our

552
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,880
scope but trying to think about um the

553
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,278
strategy that the business strategy that

554
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,400
these different operations did uh what's

555
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:33,839
really evident is that um even though

556
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,320
they had really high operating budget

557
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,399
these program based ones were not

558
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:40,439
actually that much more profitable in

559
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:44,640
very small farms that were primarily

560
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,640
earning from the sale of egg

561
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:49,079
products so uh one thing that we tried

562
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,000
to do is because again there's a range

563
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:53,038
of sites we tried to sort of represent

564
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,440
this in a way to help us sort of get our

565
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:58,679
heads around uh some of this information

566
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,200
of um uh earnings and profit and cost

567
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,720
and so we use a small area 0.1 acre and

568
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,159
it's a funny thing to use that because

569
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,600
when you scale up if you want to

570
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,400
represent things on an acreage basis U

571
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:12,000
that's really common in our work in

572
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,919
rural agriculture but that scale up is

573
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,880
fraught with so many errors and doesn't

574
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,320
really represent sort of the intensity

575
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,200
of production in these Farm systems so

576
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,079
we actually scaled everything to a tenth

577
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,080
of an acre because that is sort of the

578
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,759
that is a unit that it really I think

579
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,038
represents the intensity of the way

580
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,440
these people are doing and managing

581
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:30,440
their business

582
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,159
so um and it provides sort of a way of

583
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,640
uh comparing across these different

584
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,360
categories and we're going to use this

585
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,799
same metric of a tenth of an acre to

586
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,158
look at a bunch of different things

587
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:43,720
about these

588
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,278
Farms so um when you look at just a

589
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,839
tenth of an acre and you look at the

590
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,359
sort of um a sales all of a sudden we're

591
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,278
looking at a really different framework

592
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,759
between these different types of

593
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:56,400
approaches where our one of our Farms

594
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:59,319
that's farming a very small scale is

595
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,000
making U $55,000

596
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:02,399
as far as their top and from a tenth of

597
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,759
an

598
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,400
acre um and uh and if you look at that

599
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,240
production Focus the first set of bars

600
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,120
at the far end um in fact the um the

601
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,240
total profit for that 10 fo acre is

602
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,399
higher than those other Farms that had

603
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,880
much higher operating

604
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,240
budgets so um with embedded within this

605
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:26,200
is the controlled environment farm and

606
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:29,640
so that has um uh you know the the

607
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,319
ability to farm year round uh and it has

608
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,278
a much higher earning so that's kind of

609
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:34,639
lost in this and so we want to we

610
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,000
recognize that but if you really just

611
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,640
look at a tenth of an acre over a whole

612
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,960
year annual sales um the very small

613
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,960
farms don't look that

614
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,319
bad one of the key factors in affecting

615
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:56,398
this um that is actually quite dramatic

616
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:58,480
is the use of season extension and so

617
00:24:56,398 --> 00:25:01,038
many of these farms and I think Molly

618
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,440
probably share more about this um use

619
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:07,000
high tunnels and they benefited from an

620
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,038
nrcs program in which uh producer can

621
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,839
get um the cost of a high tunnel paid as

622
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:14,759
long as they report yield data from that

623
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,359
tunnel and um many of these Farms that

624
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:18,240
are growing outdoors with season

625
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:20,398
extension are using High tunnels and if

626
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,720
you actually focus in on that middle

627
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:25,918
section um you can see that their

628
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,679
earnings and their overall um profit per

629
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,399
tenth of an acre is higher than those

630
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:35,440
that are using controlled environment

631
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:37,759
agriculture so the ability to farm

632
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,399
really intensively using the soil based

633
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:43,000
media here based on this our um study

634
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:45,199
and the sort of information that we have

635
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,919
uh um for those particular Farms when

636
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,038
they had that season extension it really

637
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:51,440
did a lot to enhance the security of the

638
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,200
farm and manage risk for the farm by

639
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,240
increasing the months of production but

640
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,960
also then the total um output and the

641
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,120
value of that production

642
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,480
um Yes again these are ranges so on the

643
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:07,319
left CA it's the range of the Farms are

644
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:11,200
um as far as the 10th of an acre that's

645
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:15,439
like the the oranges um uh anywhere from

646
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,240
uh 47 to 7 is their total sales but then

647
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,720
the profitability is much lower on the

648
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,720
10th of an

649
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:26,000
acre so um one of the again it's

650
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:27,480
difficult again we're trying to sort of

651
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
give you a couple of different lenses to

652
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,798
look at this it doesn't show you the

653
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,519
scale um the months Outdoors that people

654
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,278
are producing are varies based on the

655
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,798
region you saw the sort of range of

656
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,558
farms we have from the east coast to the

657
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,440
West Coast and the South so some people

658
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:44,359
just out they can grow outdoors and it's

659
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,080
just easier to do it um uh even our

660
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:48,879
farms in the South are using um a the

661
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:50,319
high tunnels it's a really tremendous

662
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,600
program that probably has had more

663
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:56,960
impact on those operations and any other

664
00:26:53,599 --> 00:27:00,918
intervention um that's coming from

665
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,360
USDA um and then uh another issue that

666
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,880
this does mask a bit is the diversity of

667
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,439
the crops that are being grown on these

668
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,080
farms and so that is actually sort of

669
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,240
the next lens that we want to sort of

670
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:16,079
give you a sense of um and so one of the

671
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:20,759
things that we've found is that those

672
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:23,599
Farms um that were actually grow um uh

673
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:25,558
and there's a new care uh a new um

674
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,639
category here and we're calling it

675
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:29,119
specialized um those are the Farms that

676
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,960
are earning more than half of their

677
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:35,079
total income from the sale of one high

678
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,759
value product most of the times these

679
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,000
Farms are growing things like micro

680
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:42,278
greens or salad

681
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,200
greens uh and the Farms that were able

682
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:50,000
to specialize actually had higher

683
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,919
profitability and this is actually kind

684
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
of important especially in terms of

685
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,720
thinking about the overall food security

686
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,720
um and the sort of impact on community

687
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,200
that these Farms could have because if

688
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,319
they're having to to be profitable they

689
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,558
are narrowing the number of crops they

690
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:11,960
grow um a salad does not a full belly

691
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:13,558
make and it's a challenge it's the

692
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,798
challenge of building a profitable

693
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:18,079
business what do you make on a square

694
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:19,918
foot basis what can you earn where do

695
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,558
you have a consistent marketplace where

696
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,120
do you take advantage of your resources

697
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,359
those Farms that were uh intensively

698
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:30,959
producing fewer crops um and those

699
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:32,879
specialty high value crops for specialty

700
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,240
markets were the ones that were actually

701
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,559
able to demonstrate a more profitable

702
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,679
business so um uh the ones that were

703
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:44,480
non-specialized those Farms were growing

704
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,120
A diversity of crops often using a CSA

705
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,759
or some other type of a marketing

706
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:50,558
channel or farmers markets but um again

707
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:52,480
they were having to sort of balance a

708
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,240
broad number of crops that they were

709
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,599
able to provide to their

710
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,599
customers in contrast to those that were

711
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:59,599
specializing

712
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,000
um and then so we can sort of talk about

713
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,918
what is those Market channels that these

714
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,798
different Farms are using and they are

715
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:10,679
the same ones that we would see Urban

716
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,798
farmers use or rural Farmers using

717
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:16,320
farmers markets csas uh does everyone

718
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:18,480
know the term CSA is anyone not a

719
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:22,918
community supported

720
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:26,440
agriculture I see shakes yes okay um so

721
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:29,000
uh very common um in uh from many small

722
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:33,640
farms in rural areas and these firms as

723
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,839
well but um gr for a CSA frankly is a is

724
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,759
a lot to ask for a small SC for a very

725
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,519
small footprint because you have to

726
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,960
offer uh a diverse number of crops and

727
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:44,079
so you're moving away from that

728
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,038
specialization and your ability to plan

729
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,599
and use your space most efficiently

730
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:49,720
there's always crops that don't make you

731
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,278
any money when you're going for a

732
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,319
CSA and so those Farms were not earning

733
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:56,000
or profiting as much as the other farms

734
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,558
and the farmers market you're capturing

735
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,640
all of that direct retail funds

736
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,480
um but those folks who are using um uh

737
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,640
direct wholesale to restaurants and

738
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,919
other types of uh purveyors so directly

739
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,559
selling at a wholesale they were um they

740
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,159
were okay of course they were probably

741
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:15,398
more specialized in what they were

742
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:18,240
growing um but they uh didn't do too bad

743
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:21,239
as far as being um more profitable than

744
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,679
certainly the CSA Farms um but it's

745
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,558
still um uh challenging to them because

746
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,320
they have to specialize and the

747
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,798
profitability is not necessary neily

748
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,839
always

749
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:35,359
there but so um but the markets and

750
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,519
again U uh I always want to sort of add

751
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:40,199
the caveat that for many of these Farms

752
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,759
they're not paying owner the owner has

753
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,480
not paid a salary so that makes it

754
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,480
really challenging and if you look at

755
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,880
sort of over comparing just about if an

756
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,440
owner is taking a draw versus not um uh

757
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,919
the on the other side the owners are

758
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,558
actually paid as part of the uh expenses

759
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,679
of the farm and then closer to me

760
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,200
they're not being paid um but they're

761
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,759
taking basically the profit from the

762
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,639
farm or other things from the farm to

763
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,158
support the household and the family

764
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:08,119
they often have other jobs off of the um

765
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,519
farm so there's a complement of income

766
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:14,079
coming into a family um so there's a

767
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,519
wide range and there's a it's a wide

768
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:19,960
there's a basically a fairly wide range

769
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:23,919
of uh total incomes per month in on a a

770
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:26,440
0.1 acre basis uh but you can see that

771
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,799
the sort of bars right now as far as uh

772
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,240
the upper earnings um for those that

773
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:34,158
aren't being paid that's that money is

774
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,880
really going to the um owner

775
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,639
alator but it's there's just not a good

776
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,919
way to separate it out we do have

777
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:43,079
information in our collection of based

778
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,278
on labor hours and total labor hours so

779
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:47,079
that's one of the things we're trying to

780
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:49,079
analyze is paid labor almost all these

781
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:51,199
firms use unpaid labor through

782
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:53,199
volunteers and we know that's fraught

783
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,080
with a lot of challenge because uh it's

784
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,038
not actually a legal label labor

785
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,798
category in most cases and so we are

786
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:02,319
really trying to work on these issues

787
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:04,359
related to uh volunteer labor on in

788
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:07,079
farms whether Urban or

789
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:09,240
rural so um that just gives you an

790
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,359
overview and a sense of the sort of

791
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,440
types of farms that we're seeing um I

792
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,319
think the real take-home message is that

793
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,919
these highly specialized Farms that are

794
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:19,678
growing in soil can be quite profitable

795
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,519
and competitive in their areas if they

796
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,399
have season extension technologies that

797
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,159
they're using um and that the word in

798
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,959
some ways is still out about controlled

799
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,840
environment agriculture firms relative

800
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,919
to the final sort of profitability but

801
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,720
with the caveat we you know we are not

802
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,519
completely comparing Apples to Apples

803
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,200
here because of the way people are

804
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:44,120
representing their own salary draw this

805
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,120
is the challenge across small farms

806
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,678
everywhere so that's a lot of different

807
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,558
ways to look at data and I figured it'd

808
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,559
be helpful if we actually applied those

809
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:58,918
lenses toce you guys to so uh Karen

810
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:01,839
Fresh Garden remember the um the refugee

811
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:05,519
farmer um she is production focused she

812
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:08,398
does very few other activities um and

813
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,880
she had received that equi Grant um that

814
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,439
allowed her to get the high tunnel that

815
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,320
she implemented at the end of last year

816
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,278
um but that did not actually figure into

817
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:19,119
her sales for 2015 she really didn't get

818
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:20,519
up and running until January um so she

819
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,278
doesn't actually fit in that season

820
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,558
extension category um and like I said

821
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,359
she's non-specialized she's growing a

822
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:28,519
wide variety of things and she's proud

823
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,879
of that

824
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,200
um and her income for those I think that

825
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,760
there were seven I know that there were

826
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,159
seven production Focus Farms was around

827
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:40,879
the middle um in terms of her uh yield

828
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:42,600
per 10th acre um she sells for eight

829
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,200
months of the year at the two farmers

830
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:46,638
markets that she sells through and those

831
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:50,440
are her primary uh those were her only

832
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:54,199
actually um Market channels in

833
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,558
2015 and um she has no paid labor does

834
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,200
not pay herself a salary but her family

835
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:02,000
helps out and her um her family members

836
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,600
also have off- farm jobs so together

837
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,480
they are um supporting the household as

838
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:10,598
is some of the yield from the farm but

839
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,358
she and every other farmer that I've had

840
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,399
an opportunity to speak to over the past

841
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:17,319
year did not figure how much she was

842
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:20,358
taking from the farm so hard to be able

843
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,720
to put in dollar value on that uh she

844
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:26,440
pays herself in the profits like Anu

845
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:29,239
suggested and um she is an excellent

846
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:32,960
Record Keeper when it comes comes to her

847
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:34,799
production but not when it comes to her

848
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,878
finances and she gets a lot of

849
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,000
assistance actually through uh the

850
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,199
training program that she worked with

851
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,760
for four years um and then graduated

852
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,918
onto her own Farm the new RIS for

853
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,280
refugees program so she wants to improve

854
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,319
her ability to manage her own finances

855
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,839
but that's predicated on her English

856
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:58,000
language acquisition which she is not

857
00:34:54,838 --> 00:35:00,000
totally on board with the T herself too

858
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,679
for a lot of reasons including the

859
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,199
amount of time that she has including

860
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,000
the fact that she wants to diversify her

861
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:06,319
markets and start selling to restaurants

862
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,400
because she sees that there's more

863
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,760
potential for her to be earning more

864
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,559
money potentially if she works or with

865
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,240
restaurants book and range uh is it one

866
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:17,719
of those Diversified Farms we talked

867
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,598
about like I said they have a lot of

868
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:21,759
other things that they do about half of

869
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,200
their income comes from nonproduction

870
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,560
related activities um they have high

871
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:31,159
sales because they're specializing in uh

872
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,480
micro greens and salad greens and edible

873
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:37,039
flowers um and they have two high

874
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,119
tunnels on their Farm in Brooklyn one

875
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,639
high TL Farm Queens and they are heating

876
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:44,160
them throughout the winter to grow those

877
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:47,480
micro greens so they do have 12 months

878
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:49,759
of sales a year um and they pay all

879
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,639
their employees they used to have

880
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,319
volunteers as kind of a community

881
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:57,879
outreach uh opportunity but they

882
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:59,400
realized that it was costing them too

883
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,800
much money to have volunteers and they

884
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,000
were better off paying people who were

885
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,680
skilled in their labor to do their work

886
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,559
so they have 12 full-time year round

887
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:11,078
employees and another 12 part-time

888
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,838
seasonal employees and they are

889
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:17,599
continuing to refine their crops they do

890
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:19,639
very intensive recordkeeping uh to

891
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,519
figure out what's making money what's

892
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:24,318
making money and what's not per square

893
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:26,679
foot um and they're also scaling up

894
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:28,239
their events they're aiming to do 10

895
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:30,279
weddings in

896
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:34,519
and I haven't checked in to see how many

897
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,519
wasn't mine um

898
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,880
so Green City Growers um is controlled

899
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,279
environment agriculture obviously but

900
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,440
they are program focused like I covered

901
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,400
before and the way that they are

902
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,039
supporting their employees um and half

903
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,440
of their total income is coming from

904
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,039
their sales in 2015 and they're

905
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,079
continuing to scale that up but the

906
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,838
other half is coming from Grants um and

907
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,079
they also have significant loans that

908
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,480
are not operating loans but just as kind

909
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,480
of to keep in the back of your head this

910
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,159
wasn't a cheap thing to start

911
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,880
up um they're doing all direct wholesale

912
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,440
they're selling to Major grocery store

913
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:14,119
chains uh in

914
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:17,838
the near Midwest region want to call

915
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:21,079
Ohio the Midwest but the near Midwest um

916
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:23,440
and everyone is getting paid they the

917
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:26,640
starting salary or the starting wage for

918
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,119
a a worker at uh Green City Growers is

919
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:32,679
$10 an hour and they become members of

920
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:36,800
The Cooperative their pay increases from

921
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:40,358
there about a dollar a year um and their

922
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,640
big problem right now is building out

923
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:45,318
more markets they built this facility

924
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:47,118
and they say this themselves they they

925
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:49,838
built this facility and thought they

926
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:54,039
will come they will buy our lettuce they

927
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:56,480
are near to about 14 major institutions

928
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,880
hospitals colleges museums and they

929
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,159
figured this would be easy sell but what

930
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,240
they didn't realize is that a lot of

931
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:05,199
those institutional customers don't use

932
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:07,439
head lettuce they want pre-cut lettuce

933
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,439
and they're recognizing now that that

934
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,079
probably would have been something that

935
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,159
they should have investigated um but

936
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,400
they're very open with that it's just

937
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:18,679
worth noting too this is the only major

938
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:21,880
large scale uh indoor growing operation

939
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:25,559
either with um in green houses or in a

940
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,680
totally closed system um uh with no

941
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:30,358
lights and only using LED lighting that

942
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:34,279
was willing to be a part of our study a

943
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:38,078
lot of those types of larger businesses

944
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:40,079
have great front-facing um public

945
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,599
relations but they're not really willing

946
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,960
at this point to share information about

947
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,960
their sales because and about their

948
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,480
technology because they are trade

949
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:54,400
secrets in this very Nation uh

950
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,838
industry so that's just what those

951
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,079
financial findings look like when we

952
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:00,159
look at the farms and I want to talk you

953
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,839
through a couple of other findings uh as

954
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:05,559
well so the farmers are largely

955
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:07,639
self-taught um it's surprising how many

956
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,159
farmers say you know four years ago I

957
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:11,719
didn't know anything about farming and

958
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,838
people don't usually pick their dentists

959
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:16,719
that way but they but Farmers I guess

960
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:18,358
there's a little bit more leeway um but

961
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,959
they're working on small scale so maybe

962
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:24,039
there's a better opportunity to learn

963
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:26,519
more on small scale um and they really

964
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:28,599
want help building out their skills they

965
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,960
recognize that they don't have a lot and

966
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:34,280
um there is a call for having extension

967
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,920
agents in urban areas there aren't uh in

968
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,960
a lot of the places that we visited um

969
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:43,119
and they're lucky because overall their

970
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,639
support from the community is high

971
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,960
they're is sometimes tension when these

972
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:49,000
uh when these Farmers come in and we're

973
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,599
going to talk a little bit about that

974
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,639
tension um but overall the community

975
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,440
support is high even if the zoning and

976
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:58,199
legal support is not High um because

977
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,159
agriculture is not not an accepted use

978
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:02,480
in most cities only in one of the cities

979
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:04,559
that we uh profiled a farm in was

980
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,599
agriculture already on the books and

981
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:11,119
that was in Kansas um and the farmers if

982
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,559
they had a policy recommendation I think

983
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,280
it would probably be similar to most

984
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:18,679
farmers and it is ways to reduce their

985
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,000
costs um and they have high costs High

986
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:24,239
utility costs High land costs um and

987
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,400
they've benefited like we said from

988
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:29,639
programs like the nrcs equip program

989
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,000
that helps them get high tunnels and

990
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:35,159
they want to see more like

991
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,318
that so just to walk you through a few

992
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:40,679
of our preliminary findings and I'm

993
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:42,599
going to do this quickly um land access

994
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:46,559
is an issue as you can imagine it's hard

995
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,920
to find land in a city to do farming um

996
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:49,799
especially land that does not have a

997
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,800
toxic history or that you can even find

998
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,400
the history on I'm going to add that

999
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,240
this is also the primary issue for

1000
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,240
people trying to start farms in

1001
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:05,399
and as Anu covered before and as I said

1002
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:06,838
a little bit about um they are using or

1003
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,039
they are finding they are profitable

1004
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:13,078
when they focus on Niche produce um and

1005
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:14,838
not the whole CSA calorie crop uh

1006
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:17,200
production uh

1007
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:19,559
strategy uh the costs of social

1008
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:20,719
entrepreneurship are high that's all of

1009
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:22,880
the things that you do that aren't

1010
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:26,039
farming when you're in City taking kids

1011
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,838
on tours and having a workshop on

1012
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:30,159
beekeeping those those are things that

1013
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,239
people are often doing for free and

1014
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,598
they're great community outreach tool

1015
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:37,598
especially if they're trying to build

1016
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:40,240
knowledge of where food comes from for

1017
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,119
people who don't have access to Farmers

1018
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:43,118
but that means that they're not farming

1019
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:45,838
and when they're not farming they're not

1020
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,640
making money um water costs in

1021
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:50,400
particular are still very high for

1022
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:52,318
Farmers when they really need uh that

1023
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,838
water and they're often paying sewage

1024
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:56,679
fees and storm water fees which are

1025
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:57,759
extra on top of just the irrigation

1026
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:00,480
water cost

1027
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,880
and then finally commercial Urban Farms

1028
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,920
are primarily owned by white people who

1029
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,160
are who are farming regardless of where

1030
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,440
they are whether they're in a community

1031
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,960
of color or they're in a white Community

1032
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,480
those are usually the people who are

1033
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,159
doing the commercial farming there are

1034
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,199
other sorts of farming that happen in

1035
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,480
the city but for commercial purposes

1036
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:22,000
it's one of the reasons why we had a lot

1037
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,039
of difficulty getting into diversity in

1038
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,679
terms of ethnic background and racial

1039
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:30,759
diversity and socioeconomic University

1040
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:34,440
because it requires we finding certain

1041
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,800
things in order to get your on the land

1042
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,039
so I'm going to skip over the land

1043
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,519
access piece because we're running out

1044
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:43,440
of time but um I'm happy to talk more

1045
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,960
about how zoning has been affected the

1046
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,358
one thing I will mention is little city

1047
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,000
Gardens which is up here is the one farm

1048
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:52,880
that we profile that has lost their land

1049
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,440
since we started this process um and

1050
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,160
they are out at the end of the year and

1051
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,039
is going to be developed it is one of

1052
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:01,838
the last significant green spaces over a

1053
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,960
half acre in San Francisco um and it is

1054
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:06,480
now going to be a

1055
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,800
school um I want to head over to Anna to

1056
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,358
talk a little bit about the racial

1057
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,640
question so one thing that's um really

1058
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:18,318
apparent in the urban egg space is the

1059
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:20,598
um real tension around racial inequity

1060
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:22,000
um and the structural racism that played

1061
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,200
out in every single one of the cities

1062
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,880
and places we were and it's not the kind

1063
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:27,639
of thing that we talk about very often

1064
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,838
in rural places because everyone there

1065
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:31,159
is primarily

1066
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:33,639
white um but what has played out in many

1067
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:35,440
of these cities and I is

1068
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:37,558
that um particularly the

1069
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,880
African-American Community is not only

1070
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,839
trying to farm they're also trying to

1071
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,119
affect the health and well-being of

1072
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:46,599
their communities often uh lower

1073
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:48,960
resource and impoverished communities

1074
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:52,119
and they are systematically and

1075
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,318
systemically not able to access land

1076
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:57,358
it's actually uh really deeply

1077
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:59,480
disturbing and one of the issues that um

1078
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,000
we confronted ourselves in trying to

1079
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,920
visit and talk to some of these Farms

1080
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,239
that have built you know viable Farm

1081
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,280
businesses but they're like what

1082
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:09,239
difference is this going to make us to

1083
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,839
talk to you and I think it's U one of

1084
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:15,318
those places of sensitivity everybody

1085
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:17,039
has a social mission in mind but um uh

1086
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:18,880
one of the far one of the one of our

1087
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:21,679
Advocates here in the New York City

1088
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,000
itself here in Washington she is just

1089
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:26,719
she just said you know if you really

1090
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,318
want to help us just ask us what we want

1091
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:29,838
don't tell tell us what we want ask us

1092
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,759
come into the community ask us what we

1093
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:34,880
need to support the development of our

1094
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,160
farms and I think it's something that um

1095
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,000
is actually the center of the next step

1096
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:41,639
of this project is really how do we

1097
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,440
create honest conversation around this

1098
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:46,639
stuff and work with planners policy

1099
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,599
makers and developers who don't have a

1100
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,558
language in order to communicate about

1101
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,920
this type of use for

1102
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,119
land um and I think what we're going to

1103
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,119
do is just uh we this other piece that

1104
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:59,720
ties to this is social entrepreneurship

1105
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:03,559
and I just want to take a moment to talk

1106
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:06,078
about this with you because um we h a

1107
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:07,960
lot of the Farms six of the 14 have

1108
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,519
specific educational activities that

1109
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,880
they're doing and they are they really

1110
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:15,599
recognize you know the that here you

1111
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,119
have this Farm in this urban area and

1112
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,280
all of these people have no idea where

1113
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,640
their food comes from it is part of our

1114
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:25,160
mission to sort of change that and

1115
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:27,519
actively um sort of help bring schools

1116
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:30,279
and get kids familiar with how you grow

1117
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,880
stuff and parents so they understand the

1118
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,000
value of Agriculture um and so it's a

1119
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,440
service that they're providing and it is

1120
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,838
an unpaid service for the most part all

1121
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,159
of Agriculture benefits from this

1122
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:44,679
activity but yet it's Urban Farms on

1123
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:46,318
their own they're sort of soldiering it

1124
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:48,118
and and and whether it's a community

1125
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:49,838
garden or an actual commercial operation

1126
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,000
that's doing it so what does that mean

1127
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:54,159
for all of Agriculture this is a a

1128
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,440
question how and where are Partnerships

1129
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:58,118
with Urban Farms like this actually able

1130
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,480
to facil itate greater awareness that

1131
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:02,480
benefits all of Agriculture not just

1132
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,358
those few little farms in those small

1133
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,519
communities so it is a contextual thing

1134
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:11,920
how do we build this

1135
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:14,440
out um and so uh we know that these

1136
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,358
cases um uh the whole point of the study

1137
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:19,400
has been to really try to elevate

1138
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,400
examples where people are making livings

1139
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,639
or trying to be commercial on a very

1140
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,720
small space well it's just challenging

1141
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:28,000
by the footprint but it's challenged by

1142
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:30,759
all of these other so economic and

1143
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,280
cultural things going on around them uh

1144
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,040
but I feel like we have found some

1145
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,079
really exciting stories and what's

1146
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,639
really interesting to me is that the

1147
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:40,359
story that these Farms are telling when

1148
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,960
they're really focused on growing food

1149
00:46:40,358 --> 00:46:44,039
and growing it in a good way um is not

1150
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,920
that different than what we see in a

1151
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:48,000
rural place but we haven't connected

1152
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,639
this very actively in different ways and

1153
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,440
so many of these Farms are really hungry

1154
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:54,838
to interact with their rural colleagues

1155
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,480
to be learning the best strategies to be

1156
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:59,318
participating in those types of training

1157
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,679
programs to be uh doing the hard work of

1158
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:04,519
capturing their costs in a more active

1159
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,279
way um and they recognize that you know

1160
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:08,358
here I'm growing lettuce or I'm growing

1161
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,720
micro greens none of this is dealing

1162
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:12,719
with the real food insecurity issues

1163
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,239
that my community faces but if I'm going

1164
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:15,679
to do a business this is how I have to

1165
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:20,078
approach

1166
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:21,879
it so um but in the end it's being there

1167
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,680
and being in that place in doing

1168
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,400
agriculture that has a huge impact on

1169
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:29,199
their communities and what's um we need

1170
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,559
are some ways in which we can actually

1171
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,679
quantify that how do you actually

1172
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:35,319
quantify a change in the land values of

1173
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,799
a community because of a farm that's

1174
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:39,838
come in there and taking place and

1175
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,000
actually affected all sorts of things

1176
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,759
Neighborhood Activity how do you put a

1177
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,960
price t on that um there's people trying

1178
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,520
right now to sort of understand what is

1179
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,199
what how do you measure social impact

1180
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,639
how do you turn it into a number that we

1181
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,439
can use to sort of assess uh the actual

1182
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:58,799
broader impact of these types of

1183
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,480
activities so um uh I think that's as

1184
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,640
far as future research one of the things

1185
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,760
that we're recommending to USDA is to

1186
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:06,000
sort of think about how they're

1187
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,559
investing in these types of metrics and

1188
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,480
coming up with other ways to complement

1189
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:13,000
the classic economic basis for which we

1190
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,639
evaluate uh business

1191
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,599
impact so uh we're going to be taking

1192
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:19,920
the study um USDA once we're finished

1193
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:21,920
with our work we've been working with a

1194
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,960
group of 14 advisers from around the

1195
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,838
country people that are real experts and

1196
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,358
deeply vested in or um Urban agriculture

1197
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:30,880
who've been working with us to sort of

1198
00:48:28,358 --> 00:48:32,960
think about how do we tell this story um

1199
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,240
because it has sort of Fairly

1200
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,000
broad-reaching possibly impact

1201
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:38,519
particularly for planners and

1202
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,039
individuals that are sitting in that

1203
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:43,719
role in city and urban government uh so

1204
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:45,800
uh what we want to do is once we're done

1205
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:47,399
with this part of it and this and and

1206
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,599
this work is published is that we will

1207
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,119
be doing Regional uh presentations of

1208
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:54,160
this and cultivating sort of more

1209
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:56,760
Regional dialogue and conversations with

1210
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:58,960
planners as well as those activists lead

1211
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,400
leing to a national uh community of

1212
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,519
practice that's really focused on the

1213
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,318
farm bill so that's the activities for

1214
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:06,880
the next year is to sort of bring

1215
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,920
together those people that are either

1216
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,358
farming themselves are are currently

1217
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,838
committed to trying to figure out how do

1218
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:14,759
we make Urban Farms more successful and

1219
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:16,719
then how do we connect that to other

1220
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,040
individuals that are trying to really

1221
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,959
think about um those broader social

1222
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,039
impacts of the farm bill and think about

1223
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,760
what what particular changes in USDA

1224
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:27,639
legislation how do we recraft or change

1225
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,119
the authority of the rural development

1226
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:32,719
arm of USDA so it could be rural and

1227
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:34,838
urban AG development um sometimes it's

1228
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,959
just changing a word or dropping a word

1229
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:39,679
that allows uh grants and funds to be

1230
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,079
used and deployed in urban areas so

1231
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:45,039
that's one of our intentions uh because

1232
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:48,440
of what Molly said that there's very few

1233
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:50,679
um uh U controlled environment a

1234
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,559
operations that are fully contained and

1235
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:55,279
no vertical Farms were included in this

1236
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,798
completely contained LED based farms uh

1237
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,880
we are working right now with

1238
00:49:56,798 --> 00:50:00,719
Association of vertical farming and Neil

1239
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,599
and a couple of others to try to

1240
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:07,318
actually add more cases based on that

1241
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,519
type of farming system to flush this out

1242
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:12,880
and then ultimately we want to be able

1243
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,798
to um build a deeper egg fent egg

1244
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,000
resource library to help planners as

1245
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:19,599
well as Farmers find good resources and

1246
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,239
connections often these folks um you

1247
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,920
know they are hunting and pecking just

1248
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:25,000
like everybody else on the internet and

1249
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:28,318
it's not that easy so how do you

1250
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,798
actually distill Urban um egg policy if

1251
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:31,558
you want to write an urban egg policy

1252
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:33,599
for having a livestock who's done the

1253
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:34,920
best job of considering the issues so we

1254
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,000
want to be able to take all of that and

1255
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,760
distill it into a place that can serve

1256
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,639
as a resource um and be maintained and

1257
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,880
work with our colleagues to do that

1258
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:44,400
going

1259
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,720
forward

1260
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,720
so that was

1261
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:57,440
it I was wondering in terms of

1262
00:50:54,798 --> 00:51:00,199
addressing

1263
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,480
I it seems that the traditionals model

1264
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:05,879
may not be

1265
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,880
effective that for urban

1266
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,358
agriculture pH I I these Farms have such

1267
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,798
a small fo they're never going to make a

1268
00:51:14,358 --> 00:51:20,039
very big impact

1269
00:51:16,798 --> 00:51:22,480
on and I think not that is not the S of

1270
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:24,480
goal and and yet there's so much that

1271
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,559
happens just with individual awareness

1272
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,519
and individual agency and self around

1273
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:32,319
food access to production I think that's

1274
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:36,199
the venue in the space where Urban egg

1275
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:39,358
really works um but it is kind of um it

1276
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:41,798
it's it it creates a split personality

1277
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,759
for an urban farm because there're

1278
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:45,599
supposed to be walking forth with this

1279
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,920
Banner we're addressing food security

1280
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,280
and some would quite passionately with

1281
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,358
me right now saying that's all we are

1282
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,839
about but they the bottom line is

1283
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:57,639
they're not producing anything that

1284
00:51:53,838 --> 00:52:00,838
makes any real for communi if they

1285
00:51:57,639 --> 00:52:03,318
really want to farm so can we talk about

1286
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:06,719
it what it really is and then think

1287
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:09,798
about the complimentary activities to

1288
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:12,000
amplify what it and just for an example

1289
00:52:09,798 --> 00:52:15,079
there's one Farm in Philadelphia that

1290
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,039
has a CSA not really CSA Farm box

1291
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:19,480
program that they're a farm but none of

1292
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:20,838
the food that they is going through that

1293
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,079
farm box program is coming from them

1294
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:26,199
it's coming from the big farms in New

1295
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:29,880
Jersey and Lancaster and everywhere else

1296
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:31,598
so they can take a regional approach and

1297
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,720
introduce people to the concept of

1298
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,000
regional agriculture through an urban

1299
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:37,959
farm and that actually is a way they're

1300
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,679
increasing the calorie crops that are

1301
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,358
coming into uh Philadelphia I have a

1302
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:45,000
real impact on food security there

1303
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:46,920
there's interesting programs in New York

1304
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,960
City through working with senior centers

1305
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,680
now which they're doing CSA box type

1306
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,679
models they're farming on rooftops

1307
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:56,519
they're getting exercise they're having

1308
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,759
those activities there's complimentary

1309
00:52:56,519 --> 00:52:59,920
Farms that are making money that are

1310
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,640
actually trying to make a living but

1311
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,760
we're not asking one operation to we

1312
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:08,159
don't ask Rural Farms to sort of meet

1313
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:10,240
all of these social goals why can we

1314
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,960
allow Urban Farms to function without

1315
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:15,399
that I mean furthermore it's it's like

1316
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,599
it's how why should we treat an urban

1317
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,358
farm different than we treat any

1318
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:20,720
business opening up in a farm in an

1319
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:22,960
urban area I mean what you're saying is

1320
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,798
they're primarily profit M motivated

1321
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,599
like we'd like to think every farmer

1322
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:29,318
should be right um why should they get

1323
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,960
any subsidies why should we be

1324
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:34,239
developing any educational resources if

1325
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,119
they were coming in to build Refugee

1326
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:37,838
communities or ways of bringing people

1327
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:40,440
up then that's something we would all

1328
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:43,119
invest in I think as a way to sort of

1329
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,559
grow our next Generation population so

1330
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,200
yeah I feel like there has to

1331
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:50,000
be so there should be a really clear a

1332
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:52,639
very clear social mission that can be

1333
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,639
funded and supported with outcomes that

1334
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:56,558
are related to education training or

1335
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:58,920
other things that's one certain type of

1336
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,519
operation and so Brooklyn grain for

1337
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:04,039
example they split that off they

1338
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:06,679
recognize that that takes so much energy

1339
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:07,759
and a staff onto its own and we can't do

1340
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:10,318
that and

1341
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,839
F and by splitting up it allows them

1342
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:15,599
actually to get back to the business of

1343
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:18,119
the business but not lose sight of the

1344
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:21,599
opportunity presented by being a farm

1345
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:23,880
innoc City and that's the elegant design

1346
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,519
that you know we want to be able to it's

1347
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,480
examples like that there's some there's

1348
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:29,480
all sorts of examp like that that we

1349
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,079
don't think about and I think it's

1350
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:37,358
really easy for us to consider and and

1351
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:39,039
really focus in on um uh we we confound

1352
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:40,558
think of an urban farm as an in a

1353
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:43,400
community garden they're really

1354
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:46,319
different these are farms that are not

1355
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,920
Community Gardens um there is some of

1356
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:50,119
them that feel like they are that they

1357
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,680
lose vegetables to two-legged Predators

1358
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:55,640
but not that much so they really are

1359
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:58,480
about people trying to make a living in

1360
00:54:55,639 --> 00:55:00,118
these spes so we're running way over

1361
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,119
time I'm going to suggest that for

1362
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:06,400
anyone who would like to chat with Anu

1363
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,358
and Molly they will presumably stay in

1364
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,680
front for a few minutes and and you can

1365
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:13,598
come talk to them thank you both so much

1366
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:13,598

1367
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:24,599
