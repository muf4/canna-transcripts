1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:13,320
University you very much for that

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,719
introduction that disruption yeah cannot

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,320
be go further beyond that that level

5
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:22,480
thank you so much and also thank you for

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:27,920
inviting me here especially as the

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:31,679
kadian I back 10 years of lap is a

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,480
really nice video yeah last night I even

9
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,479
walked through some of the building

10
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,679
B

11
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:51,198
lot okay um so this talk I put

12
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:56,640
on my lab server so all this slide on

13
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:59,399
that server is called uh Z lab.net

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,640
share so then you will find the slide

15
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,920
there so you you don't need to take a

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,118
picture so you will get uh high quality

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,359
uh slide from

18
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:16,680
there great um Corell ranks the number

19
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:21,359
one in the plant breeding education

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:25,280
research so then what we do in this

21
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:29,000
genomic area essentially we try to

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,040
answer two complimentary question one is

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,840
explanation

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,320
and another one is the prediction for

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,560
explanation we try to in all day maybe

26
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:44,478
uh still now we have a kind when we try

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,920
to verify it colon it that's kind of

28
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:51,000
back word or we do not have knowledge on

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,920
those Gene then we try to find them

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,599
fishing them

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,840
using lankage analysis or G was then we

32
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:02,879
try to clone them again the for the

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,759
prediction you we maybe initially start

34
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,318
with the micro assistance selection then

35
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:11,239
try to do gome wide then maybe G was

36
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:14,839
plus genomic selection and maybe in the

37
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:19,759
future there will be the artificial

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,920
intelligence so that means that backward

39
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:26,919
and forward those approach they can go

40
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:31,119
back uh each other so then this GW also

41
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:33,759
help genomic prediction so then

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,800
prediction also can be used at one meth

43
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:40,799
try to validate the gws re so then today

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,200
I'm going to talk about most of this

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,920
stuff except the validation the red

46
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:50,399
color major Focus will be on the

47
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:52,719
prediction so then we will divide the

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,920
talk into the following section first we

49
00:02:52,719 --> 00:03:00,400
go through the process from Mar

50
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:02,958
selection to genome uh uh selection

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,000
then we talk about the problem with this

52
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,239
prediction uh business then we talk

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,080
about the problem in the literature

54
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,799
there muddy water how we can help

55
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,239
everyone we see that clearly then we try

56
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:22,159
to figure out what's the reason that uh

57
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,039
uh on the hidden overfeeding problem

58
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:28,158
finally yeah maybe before artificial

59
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:33,239
intelligence even take everything we try

60
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:36,000
to uh do best improve of accuracy and

61
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,640
first let's talk about the Markus

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,560
instulation everything start from this

63
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:45,318
DNA then from the DNA we can measure it

64
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:50,319
with different genotype then we Cod them

65
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:53,238
one two 012 then we can try to do the

66
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:56,119
regression okay so then for this

67
00:03:53,239 --> 00:04:00,759
regression we can have a two approach

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:06,438
one is the this sort

69
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:10,078
of uh top down so that means for example

70
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:13,199
at buet slab we have uh use this marker

71
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,840
try to develop the king shape then with

72
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,439
this King shape we can make a direct

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,720
prediction on those individual those

74
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:25,800
breeding value so then the skin shape we

75
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:29,199
can change it we can use some selected

76
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,680
marker or compress into group then we

77
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,160
can Dev a series of

78
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,759
bler oh another way is the bottom up so

79
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:42,720
that means we start from the

80
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:46,000
value of the marker then sum them up

81
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,120
then try to get the reading value then

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,399
those

83
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,000
distribution yeah we need to have a sort

84
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,918
of assumption then different assumption

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,720
create like a different basing approach

86
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:02,918
okay so then we can think about this

87
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,919
bsiness uh see how this River start from

88
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:07,560
like I said everything start from the

89
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,399
downway

90
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,038
East uh that's from Moren Hall Charles

91
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:18,000
Henderson get his first job as assistant

92
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:22,079
professor at the conel but he's original

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,600
s from s from AA State but he developed

94
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:30,439
that one uh all the way I think the most

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:33,879
public education coming from 197

96
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:37,600
uh during that period so that's a

97
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:41,639
blob so then the next one Tred to use

98
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,720
marker that one go back to A1 so rahan

99
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,800
Fernando yeah get this marker into this

100
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,160
breeding value yeah integral with The

101
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:59,478
Blob so then the next one uh

102
00:05:52,160 --> 00:06:01,360
1994 that's the uh B breeder R Ral as in

103
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:05,240
everybody know

104
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,038
him and but unfortunately you that time

105
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,038
did not get a lot of attention for our

106
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:11,038
community

107
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:22,560
until okay 2001 okay uh mu and in go

108
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,839
that they publish this genetics paper

109
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,199
and basically they they

110
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:30,239
show how to use the entire marker

111
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,520
compared to the marker

112
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,759
how that is more useful okay that one

113
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,918
get a this community realize the denom

114
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,720
selection that's really big

115
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:45,120
contribution

116
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:49,680
um but still not get

117
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,399
used then in 2007 D he's the

118
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,038
corresponding author I'm the first

119
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,839
author and and Ro T hunter from West G

120
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,878
join

121
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:05,038
aser we actually we reinvented that G

122
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:09,280
block meas okay

123
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:13,199
and the good thing is that paper animal

124
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:17,399
science and animal read read it so Paul

125
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:21,120
when R then next year apply to the USDA

126
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:26,560
the da science uh da evaluation then

127
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:32,000
denomination B the reason is uh that

128
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:34,800
regression uh this uh basing approach is

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,759
Computing difficult and does not match

130
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,800
the existing system so then for this G

131
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,520
blob we just replace the pedigree

132
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,639
relationship with the marker

133
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:49,279
relationship so the coding is very easy

134
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:52,120
then that program get used immediately

135
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:56,439
then the next contribution is from

136
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:59,720
ignas and try to use existing pedigree

137
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:03,959
combined with the markr based pedigree

138
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:08,440
until now that's dominant the animal bra

139
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:11,638
okay then later on I did some um

140
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:14,879
Improvement on that kingship use either

141
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,918
compress to the group or use a more

142
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,199
meaningful King shape and try to do the

143
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:26,839
super

144
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:29,800
blob um un un like gwas method SO gas if

145
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:32,958
you method a is better than b

146
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,120
no matter which solution that's true but

147
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:38,399
for the denome selection that's

148
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,440
different and the order can be reversed

149
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,918
by different trait even different

150
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,000
population okay so then we figure out

151
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,799
the two factors

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,919
affect this which one is the best method

153
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,599
okay for example these two Factor

154
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:58,479
including the heart ability and the

155
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:01,800
complexity of the trade if the trade is

156
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,278
the Pol gen basically that's G blob

157
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:08,799
Works robust but if you have less Gene

158
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:12,200
then other method they works much better

159
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:14,519
and if the treat is lower her ability

160
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,440
then the compress you make a group then

161
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:20,399
you have a better position and if the

162
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,640
tree have a higher proability then the

163
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,839
base prod works best so really depend on

164
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:30,360
situation so that make it harder for

165
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,560
reader to use it so then we we build

166
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,720
this system basically is a machine

167
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,199
learning so then the machine will look

168
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,440
at the data try to figure out which one

169
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:44,160
is the best for that particular

170
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,760
data okay then for that evaluation

171
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:50,159
actually we have a

172
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:54,958
problem and the problem can be view from

173
00:09:50,159 --> 00:10:00,039
this table so this is a paper from this

174
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:04,359
uh fing father Rex perado paper H if you

175
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:06,480
look uh this prediction accuracy minor

176
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,560
30 minor

177
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,200
40 so then uh

178
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:15,199
interpretation can be problem some

179
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,200
people interpret it okay if I reverse

180
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,440
the direction it will still work as good

181
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:25,759
as for example

182
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:28,760
40% but the problem that may be not true

183
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,639
and I can show why that happened for

184
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:31,838
example

185
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,720
yeah we do the cross validation for

186
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,000
example here is the five you can select

187
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,839
the four group try to build another

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,399
group and after this you will get a

189
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:47,399
prediction for every

190
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:49,799
Pro extremes situation is leave one hour

191
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,639
you try to predict that individual use

192
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,639
the rest then you just

193
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:58,039
look the

194
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,519
problem is actually we have a two way

195
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,319
try to calculate this this piercing

196
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,639
correlation for example on the left side

197
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,399
I have that

198
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:11,480
solid that is the group we try to make a

199
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,639
predict so we had the fin tab use the

200
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:18,120
rest to make a prediction so after we

201
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,639
get the predition that red so for each

202
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,799
group we can calculate the piercing

203
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,560
correlation

204
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:29,799
immediately so that means we get instant

205
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,359
accuracy so then we get a five we take

206
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:34,240
average as the

207
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,519
final but again we can also use a

208
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,120
different way for

209
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:43,600
each both after get prediction when we

210
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,720
hold we don't calculate until we get all

211
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,759
the file group predicted then we make

212
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:54,440
one calcul at a very last so that means

213
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:57,559
yeah we have that hold so there is two

214
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:01,920
ways to calculate this pre correlation

215
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:05,239
one is instant for each fold or hold

216
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,000
that means after you get for every fold

217
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,240
then you make one

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,879
calculation so in the literature uh you

219
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,720
can see the variation between these two

220
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:19,480
and some they don't tell you exactly

221
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:25,320
what happens then the problem is these

222
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:31,800
two are different for example I use adds

223
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:35,120
that uh 281 that fling time Miss as the

224
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:37,439
has I just shuffling that phenotype

225
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,639
break connection between phenotype and

226
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,279
dooty and see what's happening so X

227
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,839
expectation should be zero you should

228
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:49,320
not have accuracy because it's already

229
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:54,120
broken then we try to

230
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:56,199
see whether this two approach the get

231
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,799
zero that

232
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:05,759
expectation so I divide them into five

233
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:09,000
groups then for each group if you look

234
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:12,039
the uh the correlation for each group

235
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,440
and the rest that reference so then you

236
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:19,159
will see they are just on the opposite

237
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,040
side of the population mean okay so that

238
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:28,078
means if you

239
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:30,838
look somewhere here uh solid stand the

240
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:33,399
the test then the open is for the

241
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,839
reference so they just on the opposite

242
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:41,159
side of the publish me so then that

243
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:45,199
means they are 100% negatively cor each

244
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:47,879
other then the problem is the training

245
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:51,319
population if you have a higher

246
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:54,240
phenotype then you tend to have higher

247
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,759
prodution so then that's completely

248
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,919
reversed to the breeding value so that

249
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:03,399
means you supposed to get zero

250
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:06,399
expectation but end up for this

251
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:10,799
simulation you get Negative

252
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:14,360
5% so that means downward

253
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:19,039
by the problem get even

254
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:21,480
worse with number of the

255
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:25,838
fold you can

256
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:29,079
see so here expectation should be zero

257
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:32,279
but number of fold increase than that

258
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:33,479
bias increase for that red color that

259
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:35,278
hold

260
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,120
that

261
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:44,000
so the mold mobile if you have a jackn

262
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,799
like a Le one out that's the wor one so

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,120
actually ja should not be

264
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:54,679
used and so you can see can easily like

265
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,320
reach like a 15% negative for the whole

266
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:59,239
accuracy then you see oh the blue one

267
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,600
pretty good that's instant

268
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,680
that means you get a fold calculate

269
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,480
immediately then average that no problem

270
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:12,638
here but it also has another

271
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,120
problem so you you're intuitive you have

272
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,600
more training data then you have a

273
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,120
better accuracy right so that means if

274
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,879
you do the experiment you have more fold

275
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,159
then your training data is larger then

276
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:28,919
you supposed to get uh higher

277
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,399
accuracy so then you will see that the

278
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:34,519
instant that the blue one start to

279
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:37,278
having problem so it start with increase

280
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,039
with number of fold but at certain point

281
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:44,799
Dr very

282
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:48,958
quick why that's related to the size of

283
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:55,120
the testing population the size is small

284
00:15:48,958 --> 00:16:00,119
is get B okay uh usually it maybe after

285
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:05,240
30 is sort of okay but if you have less

286
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:07,318
especially when you do uh like a small

287
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,560
training uh testing side then that's

288
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:15,519
really get a big problem the good thing

289
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:18,159
is for instant accuracy we have a way I

290
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,759
try to correct it so actually Fisher

291
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,278
already did this for us you a long long

292
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,759
time ago so then we should start to use

293
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:29,600
this feature

294
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:35,879
correction so then you see that U

295
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:38,800
uh a black line so then start to have uh

296
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:43,240
not like the blue one so they quickly

297
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:45,719
like uh drop so then that black line

298
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,278
that corrected inst accuracy then they

299
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,600
start to make sense that means more

300
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:52,600
training data then you have a more

301
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:58,519
accuracy uh the take home

302
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:01,439
message there are two ways try to

303
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:04,640
calculate this R accuracy p and

304
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,038
correlation both are downward

305
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,759
B then in

306
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:14,038
accuracy is uh correctable so then you

307
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:18,240
can use that feature correction correct

308
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:22,199
that instant method but uh for that

309
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,720
whole accuracy so far I have not found

310
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:28,120
the me to correct yet but this the

311
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:32,038
problem is in lure people still using

312
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:35,558
that hold accuracy even the Le one off a

313
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:38,960
lot try to evaluate the

314
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:39,918
accuracy so then the true accuracy might

315
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,880
be

316
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:47,038
done uh underestimated especially using

317
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,280
the hold accuracy on the leaving one of

318
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:53,919
that strategy okay so when the true

319
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:55,639
accuracy is law negative that peton

320
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,360
correlation could

321
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:02,640
appear yeah with unprecedent a frequency

322
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:07,038
and magnet that's kind of explain why

323
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,480
rex brados that result can have a like a

324
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:14,240
40% negative

325
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,319
qu okay so then we see more problem see

326
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,200
this

327
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:24,319
my uh yeah because Rex berado is

328
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:29,200
founding father in this area and try to

329
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:32,439
uh start with him he has a paper 2014

330
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,400
just the time I left Cornell uh propose

331
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,038
a

332
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,080
very uh

333
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,839
meaningful direction for the genomic

334
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,918
selection so that means the genome

335
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:46,279
selection if you have a existing non

336
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,240
genes uh you should incorporate that

337
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:50,000
into your prediction model that makes

338
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,839
sense yeah that

339
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,240
help and later on there are a lot of

340
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:57,678
research follow this direction breeding

341
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,880
program try to implement it try to

342
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,960
improve

343
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,400
accuracy but the

344
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,919
problem when the literature start to

345
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,840
accumulate people are doing lot of

346
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:13,559
different things then we start to see

347
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:16,519
rare stuff for example one paper showing

348
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:19,480
if you incorporate gwas result into

349
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:23,200
genome selection you can easily get a

350
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:27,240
twofold increase on accuracy for example

351
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,720
original you was 40% now you get

352
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,319
80%

353
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,960
um let me see this yeah you see that one

354
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:38,439
five time

355
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,880
increase yeah then we think

356
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:45,679
about that's true or not so then we try

357
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,960
to see if we figure out uh is any other

358
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:53,440
potential problem may be confounded this

359
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:56,558
phenomena so let let's see how people to

360
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,159
do this so then this one I label as a

361
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,798
valid prod so that means you go through

362
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,159
this process and you should be fine the

363
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:07,440
result should be reliable so when you

364
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,760
get data you divide them into training

365
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,919
and testing first then for the training

366
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:17,000
you start to conduct dwat then figure

367
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,280
out which one is assed with the tree and

368
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
with those one you calculate the

369
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:25,879
breeding value of the testing comption

370
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,440
then try to correlate with the phenotype

371
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,240
then you get accuracy so this is valid

372
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,840
so this accuracy

373
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:40,839
whole but uh the problem

374
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:43,678
people doing the different like they get

375
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:47,158
the data the entire population then

376
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,960
immediately they doing the GW then they

377
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:53,360
know which one assorted with the tree

378
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:56,558
okay so then we say whether this G real

379
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,959
work or not prediction accuracy is good

380
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:01,519
or bad so then they start to do the

381
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,000
validation so they divide the PO into

382
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,798
training and

383
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,640
testing so then try to see those are

384
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:09,679
soci read out what's the effect then

385
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,038
they do the

386
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,960
prediction then they do the

387
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:20,558
cor the problem is that the testing

388
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:25,240
population that phot tab is already been

389
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:27,038
used in this diagram so then that cause

390
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,599
hidden

391
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,440
overfeeding then they do this again

392
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:36,798
again but this is potentially can

393
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:40,960
increase your accuracy two times five

394
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:43,759
times or I just easily reach

395
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,558
100%

396
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:51,400
okay so then we we did like a

397
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:53,480
test so we yeah like we did before we

398
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,000
randomly Shu for the phot typ break the

399
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,679
connection between phot typ and G typ

400
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,798
you suppos to get accuracy of zero okay

401
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:06,400
so then we try to look at the accuracy

402
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:09,480
of the training of course

403
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,120
it's you look at the data already then

404
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,919
you do the prediction on the training

405
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:18,479
you get accuracy 40% above let Mak sense

406
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,000
okay then because nobody try to look at

407
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,319
the training

408
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,359
population then we need to look at the

409
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:29,798
testing population then for the testing

410
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:33,319
population here you see the green color

411
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:38,440
and the red color they are on the

412
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:41,359
expectation zero that approach is reg

413
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,600
regression okay they don't have a

414
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:48,240
problem they do they don't do the gwas

415
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:51,839
look at the data first and also doing

416
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,079
the gwas first then incorporating into

417
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:57,519
the prediction but is with valid method

418
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:59,599
so that means you divide the population

419
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,558
into training testing

420
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:06,319
first and they don't have a problem they

421
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:13,000
get expectation of zero but the other

422
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:17,399
one can easily get like a 10% increase

423
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,278
even should be zero and that's the G was

424
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,840
first with the invalid method then

425
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:26,240
incorporate into

426
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:29,278
R so that means the literature there are

427
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,720
lot of things tell you this really good

428
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:33,679
works actually maybe

429
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:39,038
not

430
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:43,159
and also from ad B group uh Al lier did

431
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:45,798
a really nice study and he know your

432
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:48,480
science how should be performed he used

433
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:52,359
the valid approach and tried to verify

434
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:56,360
about the 200 TR simulat to see whether

435
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:59,519
Incorporated J R can improve prediction

436
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:02,839
accuracy H is end up

437
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:05,639
with uh about like a

438
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:08,639
oneir yeah those incorporation do

439
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,278
increase accuracy but for the

440
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:16,159
majority still

441
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:17,079
don't so then the question for us is how

442
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,720
we

443
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:24,079
can improve

444
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,360
this procedure or improve the D result

445
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:29,639
try to incorporate into denom selection

446
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:35,359
to improve so then we need to

447
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:38,278
look this uh D was business first okay

448
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:40,839
so G start from

449
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:44,038
humans ER

450
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,798
glander is number one more publication

451
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:50,440
and D

452
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:52,599
okay okay so then uh in his population

453
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,679
he used like a structure the human

454
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:58,398
population so then you can look within

455
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,440
family try to look at the association so

456
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:05,079
then that remove the structure so that

457
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,200
works but that data is

458
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:11,918
limited especially in animal and plant

459
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,960
we don't have that structure so then

460
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:19,840
Richard is also Conn at the Sanford you

461
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:23,600
me this Q method then quickly drop that

462
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:28,398
false positive down but not completely

463
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:30,879
and and that approach is a slow then in

464
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:35,000
Harvard using principal component TR

465
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,480
speed up but this still have a uh for

466
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,278
the strong popultion yeah is a bigger

467
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,079
problem

468
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:46,200
now add group

469
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:48,759
Jing he has ref visit morison Hall and

470
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:54,278
we meet together we talk about these

471
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:58,759
things um help him quickly P that n next

472
00:25:54,278 --> 00:26:00,079
paper okay so then J means

473
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:04,319
approach

474
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:06,839
is for the D Community now everybody you

475
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:10,200
have a standard you have a now

476
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:14,199
distribution it's not something inflated

477
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:17,840
then you can Bon it doesn't matter yeah

478
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:22,278
uh every marker I have a probably 10 to

479
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:27,079
minor 20 then how you divide by million

480
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:29,720
both test will work no then Jing City

481
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:33,879
contribution is get the whole Community

482
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:37,240
under control okay so then of course

483
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,039
that uh mix model pro has big problem is

484
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,480
the

485
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,240
Computing then the good things Community

486
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,278
can

487
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:50,599
help you see on the left side they all

488
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:54,079
focus on solving Jing's problem yeah

489
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:57,839
Computing speed and they all publish in

490
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:59,519
very good profile Journal like PL or

491
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,798
nitrogen

492
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:06,158
whatever then the question okay how we

493
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:08,798
can make a further Improvement on J me

494
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,559
two plastic model so that means we are

495
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:15,038
not only control falce positive but also

496
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:19,678
we want control falce negative so then

497
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:21,440
we see paper continue to com out with

498
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,480
different

499
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,880
strategy

500
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,960
including three method that's very

501
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,880
different from one is called

502
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:36,120
mlmm multiple mix model and the last two

503
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,600
Farm speed and buing so they use the

504
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:41,119
multiple lockers so they have a

505
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:46,199
dramatically different power than the

506
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:50,038
rest and so far we tested beting still

507
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:53,600
rank number one and you can test that

508
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:56,319
very easily you you go to my left

509
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,558
website you click research then you will

510
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:01,119
find like a gws

511
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:04,798
uh there is R code there just less than

512
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:08,038
10 you copy paste it then about like a

513
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:10,960
few minutes then on your default working

514
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:14,960
directory you will have this graph so

515
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,278
this graph simulated like a 20 gen then

516
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,399
try to see with different model for

517
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:24,558
example you can tell this model easily

518
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:27,759
at just tell which one to use then it

519
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,639
generates gr for example you start from

520
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:34,038
like a simple model like a general

521
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:36,759
linear model or miss the linear model

522
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:40,079
like Q Plus ke so they can find about

523
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:44,240
five or six but when you move to the

524
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:47,639
bottom for example FP or beating you can

525
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,759
easily get that one double you can find

526
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:54,640
12 like Lo

527
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:58,720
n okay so then this different method

528
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,640
method and for a particular user yeah

529
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,880
for example you work on biology you do

530
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,240
not read a lot of these me comparisons

531
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,278
confusing then you can always do it

532
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:14,079
byself you have data then you

533
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:16,640
just uh do not use that fix SE just run

534
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:21,720
again again so then you will

535
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:24,679
see which model find more genes in your

536
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,640
data and you can also change your model

537
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,798
for example change different number of

538
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:33,480
principal components as covered you can

539
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:36,440
also see which one fit to the

540
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,440
databas so then we

541
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:43,880
see yeah different uh

542
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,679
methodology then we see different uh uh

543
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:50,919
package for example including the tle

544
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:54,399
from add this group then gabit also

545
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:57,960
initiated from adds group so now I take

546
00:29:54,398 --> 00:30:01,278
care of that one so then add everything

547
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:05,558
this model we Implement into the gab so

548
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:09,079
it just tell model equals whatever okay

549
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:12,759
a bunch of them then we also have this

550
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:14,639
IAD not IAD okay but have the same

551
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:17,519
philosophy try to make it easier this

552
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,640
one have a Graphic user

553
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:25,120
interface in term of how we can

554
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:27,799
incorporate this gwas result into

555
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:31,759
prediction like Alex Li

556
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:35,440
indicate that will use qk model then

557
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:39,480
two3 do not show the increase on the

558
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,720
pred so then we try to see what about we

559
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,558
improve the method whether we can

560
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,880
improve that one so then we can see on

561
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:51,720
the left side that's D blob without

562
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,720
incorporation G was without but when we

563
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:58,240
incorporate the

564
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:01,079
GM mix Ling model we see the accuracy

565
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,038
increase and even with a further

566
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:05,638
increase on the right right you use the

567
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:08,079
beaing you find more true genes then you

568
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:10,798
have a much better

569
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:15,119
accuracy of course when I sometimes I

570
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:17,480
say I actually means I refer to myself

571
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:22,038
and also my collaborator and especially

572
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:27,599
the people of the real hero they did

573
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:30,398
work and that's the the same graph when

574
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:34,638
I practice my job interview for this

575
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:38,719
position with ad I show this graph to ad

576
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:41,678
yeah that's how it looks

577
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:46,480
Improvement uh so that's

578
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:50,480
uh the landcape we have

579
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:54,399
uh maybe one Village in New York they

580
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:58,240
have a more trees than the whole area we

581
00:31:54,398 --> 00:32:00,839
have okay very sunny and you can see

582
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,399
easily the landscape with that I will

583
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:04,398
try to answer some question you may

584
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,240
have what do you think the opportunities

585
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:14,278
uh I mean we're kind of coming from the

586
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,278
the bottom up that can identify causal

587
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:19,440
variance you know how do you think that

588
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,440
starts spitting into these types of

589
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,960
model we don't know what the what the

590
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,700
variants do we just think they CA them

591
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:31,778
uh so how do you think these models work

592
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,778
[Music]

593
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:40,480
uh one simple for

594
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:43,119
example uh your means with that 5,000

595
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,759
land races from Mexico then you show

596
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:50,000
there is thousand genes control

597
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:53,240
flowering time if you do flowering time

598
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,159
prediction uh compared to use the whole

599
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,798
genome

600
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:02,440
S&amp;P uh with them equally build a

601
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:06,200
kingship doing the traditional G blob if

602
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:09,600
you give a different we for those S gen

603
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,360
then you will definitely get better yeah

604
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:17,278
by the way thank you very much for that

605
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:18,519
uh project so that save me a publication

606
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,679
for the

607
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:26,000
beaing um when I try to publish the

608
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,919
beaing paper is reviewed by Nature

609
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,359
genetics but when they see the real

610
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:35,360
samples on those 3,000

611
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:38,918
lines uh they find 50

612
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,959
45 uh the asservation compare with the

613
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:44,360
previous method like a Farm View that's

614
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,480
only 15 three times increase then they

615
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:50,398
get spare they don't publish that one so

616
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,798
then the paper was reject everywhere I

617
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:57,638
can submit so until you publish that

618
00:33:53,798 --> 00:34:01,038
paper you show the result gen

619
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:04,759
uh control M FR time then I say oh my

620
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:07,919
chance came so I just use yours I divide

621
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:11,239
the whole genome into those Gene area

622
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,679
and non Gene area I want to see my 45

623
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:16,918
Gene whether I have more chance landed

624
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,320
on Eugene area actually it's get

625
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:22,638
dramatically enriched finally I

626
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,039
published that paper with that

627
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,878
enrichment gig

628
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,878
signs the season

629
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:36,359
right yeah without you then now nobody

630
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:41,119
can use

631
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:42,719
D brother so um you presed some results

632
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,200
at least as I understand where where you

633
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,638
kind of take GS and you use GS to I

634
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,799
guess influence how you treat those

635
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,559
markers prediction I mean how how does

636
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,519
that compare to like some of the basian

637
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:57,400
methodologies where you assume mixtures

638
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:00,320
you let the model itself kind of sort it

639
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,440
out potentially use G as a PR have you

640
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,800
have you done those kind of comparisons

641
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:11,280
yeah um the question

642
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:15,280
is uh the incorporation I show here is

643
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,320
different gas method with G blob and

644
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,119
those gas result was incorporate as the

645
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,760
coar in that

646
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:26,960
model and

647
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:30,560
my guess is if you do the same thing for

648
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:33,440
the Basin model for Basin model you

649
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:36,400
treat all the markers as a random effect

650
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,240
but you add some fixed effect just as

651
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,039
the way we did in the gum and that

652
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:46,479
should increase the accuracy of the Bas

653
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:50,079
approach whatever the Bas it

654
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,800
is but even even Beyond just having this

655
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,000
effect right so let's take Bas R for

656
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,480
example right we have mixtures of

657
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,358
normal I mean would it have you thought

658
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,318
about looking at gws hits and and having

659
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:09,318
that influence prior probabilties of

660
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:11,800
which normal distribution might so uh I

661
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:14,559
think um you're are looking for

662
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,839
different way of incorporation so my way

663
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:20,960
is try incorporate simply as the coate

664
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:23,519
with a fixed fact and of course you can

665
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,280
incorporate the different way uh you can

666
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:29,480
also treat them as different weight or

667
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:34,640
different distribution as there as a

668
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,639
random effect that's still possible okay

669
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,519
yeah for the whole

670
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:44,519
accuracy accur before I'm wondering

671
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:44,519
there way are

672
00:36:54,519 --> 00:37:01,280
doing okay so uh the question

673
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,838
is when we do the cross validation for

674
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,839
that dividing the entire probation into

675
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:11,279
different fold uh instead randomly

676
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:13,480
whether you have other way to do the uh

677
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,000
dividing yes of course there are a lot

678
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,199
of way

679
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,639
chronically uh for example you can buy

680
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:25,439
different uh uh for example like animal

681
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,519
they have different family then for the

682
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,280
breeding material you can come from like

683
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:33,800
a different Mater breeding material you

684
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:38,599
can Bas on some like existing knowledge

685
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,920
so then you talk about uh uh another way

686
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:44,599
is

687
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:48,079
uh uh based on the fenot T yeah this one

688
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:51,000
I I don't have a very clear answer

689
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,920
because this one you touch your fin

690
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,318
tab uh at very beginning so then that

691
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,400
maybe P has a problem I need to think

692
00:37:56,318 --> 00:38:00,079
about

693
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:04,160
weather one I can divide based on the

694
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:07,880
fold then have the different category

695
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,879
then thanks you

696
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:17,879
again this has been a production of

697
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,880
Cornell University on the web at

698
