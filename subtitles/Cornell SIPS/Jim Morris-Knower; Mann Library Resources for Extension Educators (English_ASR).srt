1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:16,118
University the library is liaison to

3
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:20,000
Cooperative Extension so I do a lot of

4
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:23,518
work with extension Educators around the

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,920
state um basically trying to help them

6
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:30,278
find the information they need to do

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,960
their jobs um one of the and what I

8
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:36,479
think I might do just

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:39,160
briefly um is just show you um an online

10
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,238
guide that I've created it's sort of a I

11
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,959
think it's I think I still call it a

12
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:47,640
portal but the term portal is like it

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,039
sounds like 1995 or something I mean

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,840
it's a little but the idea is that it's

15
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,558
a um it's an online resource that's easy

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,920
to get to that sort of collects together

17
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:03,198
a lot of the resources that are

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,838
available uh two extension folks um

19
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,560
through through Cornell and through the

20
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:12,039
library and through me so I think what I

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,799
might try to do is share my screen just

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,759
to show that briefly give you a kind of

23
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,118
a quick overview of it and then I'll

24
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,599
just open it up to questions and

25
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:25,719
conversation so here's here's the here's

26
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:28,759
the portal um which is pretty easy to

27
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:32,599
find um it's just the URL is up here

28
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,599
guides. library. cornell.edu

29
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,959
CCE uh SL ccore portal you can also do

30
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,319
Cornell Cooperative Extension man

31
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,078
library and I think it'll just Google it

32
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,118
and it'll come up but and I won't go

33
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,438
into too much detail here some of you

34
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,519
actually may have be familiar with this

35
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,000
already but what I try to do here is

36
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:56,718
collect all the resources and services

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,079
that um extension staff have access to

38
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:04,280
um both um the online resources which

39
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:06,758
you know I think most everyone in cor

40
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,118
extension unless you're really new you

41
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,840
understand that you are considered a

42
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:15,680
um a full Cornell staff member in terms

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,840
of access to the Cornell resources so

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,159
there are a lot of electronic resources

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,039
that we Cornell provide

46
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:27,199
um uh pays a subscription to um and you

47
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,239
can get access to if you're current

48
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,518
Cornell faculty staff or student so that

49
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,400
includes

50
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:37,400
um all Cooperative Extension staff

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,560
members um with a net ID so uh just

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,120
again it kind of goes through what you

53
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,840
can do in terms of finding books and

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,680
journals a lot of this a lot of these

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,158
resources are available online the other

56
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,400
thing to remember for what it's worth is

57
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:53,799
if you search the Cornell Library online

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,840
catalog and find books that are in print

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,519
we still have a lot of really high

60
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,319
quality resources that are available in

61
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,480
print um if you find those

62
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:06,238
uh using our catalog and they're here at

63
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,759
man Library you can actually um order

64
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,759
those and have them delivered through

65
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,239
the mail for free um so it's not just

66
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,639
the electronic resources but they're

67
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,239
actual the print resources the the books

68
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,399
that we have um if you need that and you

69
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,599
you know it's uh not readily available

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,799
in your local library um that is an

71
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:29,919
option and so I think that

72
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,480
is uh overviewed and the it there's

73
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,598
further explanation in the document

74
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,639
delivery section right here there's a

75
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,679
link here under Library services so I

76
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,919
won't go into too much detail about um

77
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,879
that and the final section of and there

78
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,598
you know there's a lot of information

79
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:48,479
here so when you have some time just go

80
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:50,199
through it I think you know ultimately

81
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,158
let me go switch back here so I'm kind

82
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:55,438
of going back and forth um this link my

83
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,598
picture here with my link actually if

84
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,519
you click on it you you can send me an

85
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,280
email so I think if all else f salse or

86
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,200
even from the beginning you're like I

87
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,640
just need help finding information for

88
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,119
this grant I'm putting together or this

89
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,798
you know this program I'm putting

90
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,239
together or I need to do evidence-based

91
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,239
programming that seems to be a big one

92
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,959
um send me an email and I'll I'll either

93
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,399
know the resource uh or the answer or

94
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,360
I'll be able to help you find it um and

95
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,599
I'm going to so that's just on the first

96
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,879
page here it's jpk 15 it's not some

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,360
great secret or anything um and then

98
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,959
under tutorials here at the very and

99
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,160
this is where um I I put together this

100
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,680
top 10 things every Cooperative

101
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,880
Extension staff member should know about

102
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,478
the library and this is something I do

103
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,079
in person for new extension uh staff

104
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,038
when they come those who come to campus

105
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,639
um I'll do this in person and kind of go

106
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:52,680
through it I think for the interest of

107
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,280
time I I won't um what I will tell you

108
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,680
is that each one of these is a link um

109
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,719
to a variety of resources that I these

110
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,360
aren't everything you have have

111
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,000
available obviously you know it's just a

112
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,680
scratching the surface but I think

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,959
there's some of the the more important

114
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,759
ones to know from the beginning

115
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:14,198
including my email right there um I've

116
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:17,160
also put some guides here which can be

117
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,720
useful uh very specifically focused

118
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,240
guides some of them I've created some of

119
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,000
them U my colleagues have created one of

120
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,400
them

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,079
um is this finding funding and this

122
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,799
seems to be in terms of the um training

123
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,159
the web the Outreach I've done to Cooper

124
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,079
extension staff in the last couple of

125
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,199
years the the funding piece not

126
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:42,079
surprisingly seems to be one of of great

127
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:44,600
interest and so I I'll just click on

128
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,918
this link here and I I've just recently

129
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,639
let me see if

130
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,879
this um so I've recently just updated

131
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,879
this to

132
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:55,719
include uh crowdfunding sources of

133
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:59,038
information which is a relatively new

134
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,880
phenomena um but it's a way of um

135
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,719
basically passing the hat virtually

136
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,839
online and there the Corell library has

137
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,120
some electronic books that you don't

138
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,399
have to check them out you don't have to

139
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,840
order them from the library you can

140
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,679
actually just log on and read

141
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:14,598
crowdfunding for dummies um so that's

142
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,879
another source traditionally I've

143
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:22,319
focused on New York State uh US Federal

144
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:26,159
and private philanthropic um sources of

145
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,720
funding um and I do webinars on the

146
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,240
foundation directory which is the

147
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,199
primary index

148
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,360
to um private and corporate funders the

149
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:40,800
ones with you know you think Gates you

150
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:43,199
think Rockefeller um those the big

151
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,079
funding the big sources of um M and

152
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,560
actually the smaller local foundations

153
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,359
um which can have money as well so the

154
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,959
foundation directory is the the most

155
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,800
important source for that sort of

156
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,198
information um and so that link is there

157
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,319
that's a subscription database so it's

158
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,759
not freely available you everyone in

159
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,960
Cooperative Extension does have access

160
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,800
to it um it's it's not that hard to

161
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:11,159
learn um and there's some online

162
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,360
tutorials and um actually I think we oh

163
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,000
yeah in

164
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,360
2012 I think I gave one of these

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,199
webinars and I recorded it so it's like

166
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,400
30 minutes and it I I walked through it

167
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,800
I can't guarantee that it's the most uh

168
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,918
professionally done thing but it gives

169
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,879
you the the basic sense of what it uh

170
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:31,240
does and of course if you start to use

171
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,919
it and have questions um let me know Jim

172
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,918
hi this is Jen I was I was in a I think

173
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:38,719
a program program leadership development

174
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:42,079
cohort and you did you did you kind of

175
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,199
did a sit down with us and helped us um

176
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,560
look through the foundations directory

177
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:49,560
and set up alert yep yeah because I

178
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,439
think that a lot of us are now spending

179
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,038
a good chunk of time either searching

180
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,279
for funding writing grants or

181
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:59,079
administering that those grants so I

182
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,878
think um I don't I can speak for myself

183
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,918
that a little bit less time now on

184
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,360
programming a little more time on um

185
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:09,758
finding funding but then you brought up

186
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,639
a great uh great point is that now as we

187
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
are engaging in this funding it is

188
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,560
really important to be able to find

189
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,400
things like evidence-based practices and

190
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,560
that kind of support material for the

191
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:24,439
grant uh writing that you're doing so um

192
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,360
I I don't even know where to begin with

193
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,680
that you

194
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,879
know right I know it's it's you know you

195
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,680
need the

196
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,240
you need the grant funding to do the

197
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,958
programming and then you need to be able

198
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:42,959
to um

199
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:44,958
have you know a plan with evidence of of

200
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,119
your program to get the fund so it's

201
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,679
it's almost this Catch 22 you know like

202
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,639
where do you start do you look for the

203
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,958
and you have to do them both yeah I yeah

204
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,559
absolutely and I think the the

205
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,239
foundation directory and those other

206
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:02,039
sources are really great to know about

207
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,320
they exist and um you know in terms of

208
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:08,838
doing the evidence-based and finding the

209
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,640
evidence um I I certainly can I can help

210
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,600
folks with that as well that it's it's

211
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,958
not easy I mean the research I tried to

212
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,759
tell Cornell undergraduates this um and

213
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,439
you know I'm not sure it might go in one

214
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,120
year and out the other but the research

215
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,880
process takes time to do it well to

216
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,320
actually find things it gets better the

217
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,759
more you do it but you know doing

218
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,600
finding that evidence can it's not just

219
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,120
like type it into Google and you know

220
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,240
the top three hits are exactly what you

221
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,200
need to to uh you know right support

222
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,480
what you're doing um but it does get

223
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,000
easier and I I can certainly help um

224
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,759
with that process and maybe save you

225
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,278
some time too okay I think that I think

226
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:50,679
and also since we are working along you

227
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,200
know within our mission within our

228
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:56,199
priority areas that sometimes you start

229
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,959
to build

230
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,839
a uh a kind of system of knowledge or a

231
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:06,679
bunch of ideas of practices and and be

232
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,079
able to follow those down there you know

233
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:11,039
to try to build a what am I trying to

234
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:14,799
say almost a library of ideas that you

235
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,879
have now um drawing from for for grant

236
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:20,240
funding and writing writing those grants

237
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,360
so yeah I mean I I think it's um there

238
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,240
is a there is an opportunity and a

239
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:30,480
challenge here to tap into the

240
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,519
collective experience of all the

241
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,240
Cooperative Extension Educators across

242
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:39,600
the state or even Beyond you know about

243
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,959
how is it you successfully go about in

244
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,560
terms of specifically in terms of the

245
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,559
funding how is it that you do that you

246
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,278
know and sometimes you can one of the

247
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:49,958
things you can do and I think I probably

248
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,000
showed you guys this um for your

249
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:56,838
leadership cohort you can go into the

250
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,600
foundation directory and um find what

251
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,360
other you know other

252
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,278
County Cooperative Extension agencies

253
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,278
what what grants they've gotten and for

254
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:09,958
what um so you know but there is this

255
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:12,799
there is a possibility for this

256
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:16,278
Collective like you could said a library

257
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:20,159
of knowledge about how how to do this

258
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:23,958
well or or even relevant you know papers

259
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:25,958
that really speak to what we do and um

260
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:28,638
because there's so many there's so much

261
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,479
out there how do you find you know it's

262
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,000
a

263
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,200
right no it's a huge thing and they're

264
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,720
actually um they're now it's so

265
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,639
important I know here at Cornell I mean

266
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,278
I'm not really knowledgeable about the

267
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:44,879
whole the the the scholarship behind

268
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:47,039
like evidencebased methodologies but

269
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,240
they're now offering I think in the

270
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,799
College of human ecology they're

271
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,680
offering a minor in evidence-based

272
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,838
research so it's you know it's like wow

273
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,958
so it's you know it's something that is

274
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,360
obviously being

275
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:06,278
um you know it's it's being considered

276
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,839
really uh more seriously at that level

277
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:12,559
well we had recently had kind of funding

278
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,480
uh questions from Partners we work with

279
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:18,239
and they're coming down kind of above

280
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,079
from from their funders saying you know

281
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,799
we don't really want to uh follow

282
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,599
through with this project if there isn't

283
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,319
an evidence-based practice and they're

284
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,000
not just talking about something that

285
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,278
was just researched they are looking for

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,679
something kind of like a cookie cup

287
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:35,600
program that has been um instituted

288
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:37,439
somewhere has got good research behind

289
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,480
it and good evidence that it worked you

290
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,600
know that kind of um yeah yeah yeah

291
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,639
right right with a different meaning

292
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,839
than evidence-based that Oh I thought

293
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,919
you know so yeah that is that is really

294
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:52,079
interesting and the other thing I again

295
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm I'm I'm outside the the loop on this

296
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:59,359
but it also just seems that what works

297
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,078
for in terms of an evid Evidence based

298
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:08,000
programming for a say a 4 program in

299
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:12,039
Utah isn't necessarily going to work for

300
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,278
the same 4 program in onandaga county in

301
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:17,159
New York I mean I just there's all

302
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:21,000
manner of the notion of a cookie cutter

303
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:24,078
and one it's it's it's an ambitious um

304
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,559
idea certainly yeah and and conversely

305
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,359
it's kind of throw the baby out with the

306
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,479
bath water if you have a promising

307
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,680
practice something that looks like like

308
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,519
hey you know there's a lot of good

309
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:35,719
research Behind these ideas let's try it

310
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,320
out but because it doesn't have some

311
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,160
evidence-based um template uh to follow

312
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,240
it's like oh no that's not gonna yeah

313
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,799
exactly I mean I I do this all the time

314
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:50,519
with my um with my teaching that I work

315
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:52,799
with faculty um in the two colleges um

316
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,759
cows and human ecology you know and it's

317
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,240
like we're being asked the the library

318
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,199
and the Librarians are being asked to do

319
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,079
more um assessment of what we do do you

320
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,240
know to to actually assess how effective

321
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:06,439
they are and for

322
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,720
me when the faculty member says if I

323
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,199
talk to the faculty member after the

324
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,720
class and they say you know that's great

325
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:15,958
that really worked well I mean I think I

326
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,278
can see uh the Stu it was really useful

327
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:21,958
to the students for me that's that's a

328
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:24,879
really very that's a primary piece of

329
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:26,758
assessment of what I did it doesn't

330
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,039
that's not a rubric it doesn't it's not

331
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,919
something I can put in Excel and show

332
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:36,120
somebody and say 85% of the students who

333
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:38,719
took my workshop did uh you know uh s

334
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,039
significantly better on their final exam

335
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,000
that's not the level you know but for me

336
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,879
that more qualitative assessment of the

337
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,879
of the word of mouth from the faculty

338
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:52,320
member is all I need thankfully my

339
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,919
funding is not based on needing to get

340
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,040
those numbers but I think and a lot of

341
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:59,360
time if people are giving you money they

342
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,120
want the numbers they do they want to be

343
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,399
able to report back and

344
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,639
say so everybody can check off their

345
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:09,720
little box

346
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,919
yes it's that's a strange uh yeah yeah

347
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,879
not necessarily useful I I understand

348
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,078
what it has to do but in the real world

349
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:19,679
that that getting getting to people is

350
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:22,679
what we're we're after right right if

351
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,078
other people are also spending time

352
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,919
Gathering

353
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:31,198
research um to support their work you

354
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:35,719
know is there a way we can um uh share

355
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:39,519
that uh in in a in some Forum or is it

356
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,160
already being done no could right there

357
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,600
you know what I and and the the sharing

358
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:47,240
what you're basically doing is sharing

359
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,480
um published research on the on this

360
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,680
topic you know

361
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,360
basically um Journal articles is that

362
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:58,239
what um key research findings is that

363
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:02,639
the yep so that will be that will be um

364
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,919
okay so what um yeah what I would

365
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:09,039
recommend and I've worked with um a

366
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:11,958
number of other either lab groups or um

367
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,078
groups on campus to do this what you can

368
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,758
do is you can start and if you had a

369
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,519
group you don't even have to be in the

370
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,680
same office you don't even have you can

371
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,959
do this online there's a um there's a

372
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:28,799
program um called zoto it's a free

373
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:31,078
online program zo t o.org

374
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,439
I and I can I can pull let me actually

375
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,359
see let me see if I can show you an

376
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,959
example

377
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,480
um

378
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,479
Cornell uh uh what's the

379
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,079
um well actually there's one the

380
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,719
um there's oh not survey research that's

381
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:57,078
so funny um system of R intensification

382
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:59,560
okay so this is um this is through cfad

383
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:02,479
and international programs but what they

384
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:05,000
actually have done is and I've helped

385
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,439
them do this they put together this

386
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,558
online database of research so this is a

387
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,279
not to get in too much detail but the

388
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:16,439
system of R intensification is a is a

389
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:19,078
system of increasing the yields of rice

390
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,319
it's fairly controversial um and one of

391
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,959
the things this group wanted to do was

392
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:26,759
show the evidence speaking of evidence

393
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,038
um from published research on the

394
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,919
effectiveness of this system of growing

395
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,160
rice called SRI or system of rice

396
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:35,880
indentification so what they did and

397
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:40,080
I'll actually just do a search for Rice

398
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,760
because um so this is zoto and what

399
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,759
they've done is they've put together

400
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,400
this online library that and they're

401
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:49,160
probably two or three people in the

402
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,200
group who are administrators Who oversee

403
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,080
this and add material to the library um

404
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:59,200
and then it's completely open to anybody

405
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:02,158
in the world um and what it

406
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,640
um it's not the world's greatest

407
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,360
interface but it's very logical that you

408
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,200
know you can organize these the

409
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:12,000
libraries organized into some subfolders

410
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,200
and then um each one of these is the

411
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,400
link to an article depending on how you

412
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,919
want to do it you can include the full

413
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,640
text of the article um as well and

414
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,880
there's no limit in terms of the number

415
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,919
of people who can be in this group so I

416
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,080
it it works it's a it takes a little bit

417
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,720
to learn program but I think for the

418
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,319
kind of program you're talking about

419
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,839
this this could be a very effective

420
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,639
solution and I if you if you want to

421
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:42,279
explore it I'm happy to to help you get

422
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,280
um going with

423
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,679
that thanks that is helpful and so is

424
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,038
this a good way if somebody's trying to

425
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:54,240
research a topic um to sort of uh gather

426
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:56,558
you know their effort yeah exactly so

427
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,798
what you could do is if there are you

428
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,399
know what I possibly could imagine if

429
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:05,519
there's a core group of you in the in

430
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,360
your group who are doing the research on

431
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,918
you know a particular topic within your

432
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:13,319
field um and you wanted to produce

433
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,038
collaboratively this database and share

434
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:18,480
it among yourselves and then also with

435
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:20,519
the general public um that's exactly

436
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,120
what you could do so the the

437
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:27,038
program um let me actually open up um

438
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll open so what you do is you have the

439
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:32,000
program on your individual

440
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,798
computer um and I'll slide this over

441
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,319
here so it's a desktop

442
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:41,000
program um let me slide this over

443
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,599
here and you work on your own computer

444
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,159
and you you would do your research in

445
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:49,719
whatever database you like um so this is

446
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:53,000
my desk this is my desktop version of

447
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:56,200
zoto um and I've got these folders here

448
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,440
and if I scroll down here when I get

449
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,480
into this section here these are the the

450
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,240
group Library so I can the other nice

451
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,720
thing about this is I can have my

452
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,038
individual research that I collect here

453
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,919
this is only for me and then under here

454
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,279
I have these group libraries that you

455
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,840
could share so if there are say four or

456
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,558
five or six there's no limit on the

457
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:17,038
number but if if there were four of you

458
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:20,359
who wanted to create a group Library you

459
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:23,200
could have I could add um I could do my

460
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:26,319
own research on this uh you know here's

461
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,679
the group on be's um and if I did my own

462
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:31,119
research and imported these references

463
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,120
I went and did it um I would add them to

464
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,359
the library here and then the the

465
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,759
program you can see this little arrow is

466
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,000
circling over here what it's doing is

467
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:42,079
it's syncing with the cloud so what

468
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,319
would happen is the um this B group

469
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,720
online which is what everyone could

470
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:50,079
access um would be a place where people

471
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,519
could then go and see the results but so

472
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,079
it it works these group libraries work

473
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,879
very well for collaboration between

474
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,359
people and then also sharing that you

475
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,280
can make it you could keep keep it

476
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:03,240
private if you wanted to and just share

477
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:05,558
it among your small group um but it it

478
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,279
sounds like you you might also want to

479
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:10,278
make this um open to the public not that

480
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,558
they could add or edit it but they could

481
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:14,519
see it and they could download the

482
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,558
program it's you know it's actually very

483
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:19,359
and you don't need to have the program

484
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:22,319
uh installed or even know how it works

485
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:24,158
to be able to go in and um see these see

486
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,599
the results of these you know this is

487
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,240
again this is the online version this is

488
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:32,158
the this is the desktop version

489
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:36,200
so one of the questions we often have is

490
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,919
our our um gardening topic area can sort

491
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,480
of Go in all sorts of directions is

492
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:43,640
there people who could uh you know guide

493
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,599
us on how to sort of

494
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,759
organize um the you know do we have one

495
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:53,119
big folder or do we is there a

496
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:56,200
structural way that that seems to work

497
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:59,158
better than others so in terms of the

498
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,840
you're collecting all the research

499
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,880
yeah because you know we could be in

500
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:06,079
lots of different fields um you know one

501
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,799
you know we bees is a is a common

502
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:11,480
pollinators in general as a common topic

503
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:14,599
and then we can go to the uh a different

504
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,640
area where um as Jen was suggestion you

505
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:20,119
know childhood obesity and and growing

506
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:24,200
vegetables

507
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:27,399
right yeah I was I was going to say I um

508
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,600
I can tell you what the the program can

509
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,919
do here so for example um in this

510
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,959
Cornell conservation agriculture this is

511
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,200
actually the Cornell conservation

512
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,200
agriculture is another example of one of

513
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,240
these working live databases from a a

514
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,120
cow's program um so they create a master

515
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,278
Library called coron conservation

516
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:47,759
Agriculture and then within that they've

517
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:51,440
created all these

518
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:55,240
subfolders that and it can range on

519
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,159
anything um and you know and you can you

520
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,599
can actually so if I look at this this

521
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,080
level if I highlight Cornell

522
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,519
conservation agriculture I'm looking at

523
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,158
everything in the library which is

524
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,558
probably at this point thousands of of

525
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,080
citations and then if I click on one of

526
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:13,918
these like if I click under cassava I'm

527
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:16,639
only looking at the uh citations that

528
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,360
have been stored in cassaba you so you

529
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,559
can create all these subfolders and then

530
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:24,319
you can actually um put a single a

531
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:28,200
particular citation so this is a journal

532
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,678
article right here um this this

533
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,600
reference could be in more than one of

534
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,038
these folders so you could you could

535
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:36,199
have as many of these subfolders as you

536
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,119
wanted to um you know I'm not everybody

537
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,679
is tempted to have a folder called

538
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,798
miscellaneous which I think is um

539
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,480
dangerous because it's like I don't know

540
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:47,319
where but let's put it in miscellanous

541
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,480
and it just ends up being so anyway um

542
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:54,278
it the the the tools for organizing it

543
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,640
are there um I'm not I would love to be

544
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:59,038
but I am not personally a a a

545
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,520
particularly organized person so I'm not

546
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,278
sure how that best works it's probably

547
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:06,119
something for your group to hash out how

548
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:08,960
this might how this might work but I

549
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:13,558
think zoto in itself kind of gives you

550
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:16,558
the ability to at a certain level be um

551
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:20,759
to be fairly organized about it and then

552
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:23,720
just to um let me actually see so here

553
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:25,599
is the system of rice intensification um

554
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,120
and again I'm this is on my desktop what

555
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,319
I'm showing you right now this is the

556
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,278
desktop program

557
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,599
but here's the master folder and then

558
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:34,679
here are all the subfolders and

559
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:37,519
everything's doing and then if I go back

560
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,480
here there's exactly so this is this is

561
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,918
the online view this is sort of the

562
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,079
shared view that everyone sees this is

563
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:48,200
exactly the same thing so here's the

564
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:51,798
master library and then here are the

565
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,240
subfolders that um have everything there

566
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:58,119
and you know again you can choose to

567
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,200
make this um include the full full text

568
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:03,000
of the article if you do that you can't

569
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,000
make it um for copyright reasons

570
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
obviously you can't make the folder a

571
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,159
fully public one um you would need to

572
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,720
make a public view would not include the

573
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,559
full text so that's that's a small

574
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,880
consideration but uh but I have a

575
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:23,359
question about that Jim then would

576
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,320
people be able to like people who are in

577
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,798
the folder be able to print those out or

578
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,798
would they just use them as a reference

579
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,519
and then go find

580
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:33,278
yeah no they could they could um you

581
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:36,480
know if they wanted to

582
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:39,839
um if they wanted to take these you know

583
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,640
if you had the zoto program you could

584
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,599
you could join the group that's the

585
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,399
other thing is you could make it so that

586
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,959
people could join the group and download

587
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:51,038
um this into their own folder but a lot

588
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,640
of times people are just they they don't

589
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:57,000
want to be bothered with that so you can

590
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:00,399
see here I'm pretty sure um if I marked

591
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,798
all these records S I could then export

592
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:06,719
them and here are different options let

593
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:09,918
me actually H that may not be the best

594
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,319
that's actually exporting it in a format

595
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,799
let me see if there is a

596
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,278
way to I I think there should be just a

597
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:20,519
way

598
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:23,679
to um to print them out if you wanted to

599
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:25,038
or you know or email them to yourself um

600
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,600
I'll have to look into that but there

601
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:32,119
there's

602
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:36,278
definitely um oh this is interesting

603
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:37,918
um oh okay huh so you can if nothing

604
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:41,000
else if you wanted to you could do this

605
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:48,038
quick you could select a style like APA

606
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:50,599
style and then um do a oops if I

607
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:52,200
did okay I could just copy them all and

608
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:53,199
paste them into my you know like a Word

609
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,960
document or something like that but

610
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,960
there has to be an email function here

611
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,480
somewhere I'll have to look into that so

612
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,919
yeah people could print them out people

613
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,120
could email them they should be able to

614
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:06,600
email themselves and then go um go and

615
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,879
go and find them if they're in the

616
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:13,079
Cornell Network it's pretty easy to do

617
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,880
it sometimes the like in this case this

618
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,639
is a publicly available um PDF so they

619
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,360
could

620
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,640
just huh well doesn't always work the

621
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:23,719
way you plan

622
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,360
it yeah

623
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,919
so right URLs

624
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:31,798
change but a lot of this stuff is

625
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:35,159
available right through the through men

626
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:38,359
Library yes Port absolutely yep yep so

627
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:41,039
that's really cool

628
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:43,038
yeah I could see that being helpful to a

629
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,079
lot of Educators if that was essentially

630
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,158
it's kind of curated by our needs you

631
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:52,439
know we we right and each other we

632
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:54,519
figure it out um but then as we uh come

633
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,278
across these things they could get added

634
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:58,558
not that we have another another moment

635
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:00,319
of time to do anything exactly but if

636
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,599
you did I mean if you're doing this

637
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,918
anyway um it will actually save you a

638
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,319
lot of time because all you would then

639
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:11,919
need to do is and the nice thing is you

640
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:14,000
can go into your database of choice like

641
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,600
um schol like if I went to to Google

642
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,398
Scholar and I did um uh you know let me

643
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,000
just I'll say community gardening or

644
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,278
something like that I don't

645
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
know be helpful if I spelled it right um

646
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,278
but then the nice thing about the the

647
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,759
program is so I'm in Chrome on a

648
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:34,359
windows-based computer um and I've got

649
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:38,278
zertero installed and there's this

650
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:40,959
little folder here so I click on this

651
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:43,000
and then I can just grab all of those

652
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,720
citations and bring and where they'll

653
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,480
end up I'm not going to bring them in

654
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,919
right now but where they'll end up is in

655
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,120
here so and then I dump them there and

656
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,240
then it's so all I need to do is go to

657
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,678
my database do my search these are

658
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,240
probably things you're doing already as

659
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:59,759
part of your workflow um you know click

660
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,240
the import which is just clicking a

661
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,480
button uh point it you can either if

662
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,558
you've got the folder highlighted when

663
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,640
you do the import it'll just dump them

664
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,720
right in there and then when you when

665
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,120
this thing syncs which it will do

666
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,240
automatically what so those records I

667
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:20,719
brought in from Google Scholar um will

668
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:23,000
then end up in my online library here

669
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,640
automatically shared so you know if

670
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,679
you're just doing a lot of these things

671
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,120
anyway in terms of curating and

672
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,720
collecting the references um it would

673
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,518
once you learn the program and get it

674
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,919
installed and figured out the the

675
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:40,679
particularities of doing the shared um

676
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,679
management of this you're not really I

677
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,399
don't you're really not adding much in

678
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:47,360
terms of your workflow and then you're

679
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:50,639
saving in terms of the export and making

680
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,079
it publicly available and sharing it um

681
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,480
you're saving all your time and not

682
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:59,319
having to do that part of it um it's

683
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,319
pretty much automated

684
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,240
well I turn it out to to the rest of you

685
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:05,759
what do you think having that kind of

686
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,919
information like the garden-based

687
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,640
learning page already has some and we I

688
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,519
think a lot of our us as Educators have

689
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,440
tapped into those um articles that are

690
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:20,359
referenced there but would would having

691
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:23,159
something like this be helpful as we you

692
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:26,038
know a defend kind of what it is that we

693
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:29,278
do you when we talk to others about what

694
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:31,798
we do and then also as we're writing um

695
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:35,079
writing Grant

696
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:37,398
proposals question

697
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:38,720
mark the other thing I would say just

698
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:40,079
and this is definitely a conversation

699
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,038
for all of you to have among yourselves

700
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,639
whether this would be an effective tool

701
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:46,038
um you might want to think about doing

702
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,440
it on a very small scale like create

703
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:50,440
just like a proof of concept for

704
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,000
yourselves create a small like one

705
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,840
folder with 20 references in it and put

706
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,278
it up and see what it see what it seems

707
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,918
to does it seem to work

708
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:03,679
um and does it seem like you would want

709
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:05,200
to put everything you're doing into this

710
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,038
database so you might want to start in a

711
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,080
very small um part of it the other and

712
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:12,720
um I sound a bit like an infomercial

713
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:15,638
except I'm not actually selling anything

714
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,679
um the the thing you can also do with

715
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:20,199
the program which is really nice so for

716
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:24,720
like grant-based programs is once you

717
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:27,759
get your um references in here then if

718
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,120
you needed to or if in any situation

719
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,319
where you needed to share these

720
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:35,479
references um so I'm just going to take

721
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:38,398
these particular ones here I go if I go

722
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,599
create bibliography from items and I'll

723
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:44,000
just take

724
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,000
APA um and then if I go

725
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:51,678
into uh so here's a blank Word document

726
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:54,240
let me slide this over here um so I

727
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,159
copied those and then I just paste them

728
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,000
in so I've

729
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,399
created you know on the really quickly

730
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,679
um and you could have an annotated

731
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:04,798
biblography you want but anyway it's a

732
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:09,559
list of your sources that you could

733
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:11,918
include in an annual report or a grant

734
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:14,678
project or whatever you want so once the

735
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:18,080
information is in here um it's really

736
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:19,759
easy to produce formatted lists of all

737
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,398
or some of those

738
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:26,079
references so it's another nice little

739
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:29,119
uh part of the the workings of the

740
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:31,319
tool and and on a limited basis we could

741
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,119
just start with um what we already have

742
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:38,038
on our garden-based learning site and

743
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:41,398
change that from a list to uh this

744
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:45,158
actual format uh as it as they did on

745
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:48,518
the other website I right it might not

746
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:52,320
be that hard it's it's not I mean what

747
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:54,319
and again I think what um what I would

748
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:57,480
encourage you to do and I can help you

749
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:59,240
guys do this if you want to is take some

750
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,558
of the I mean I think the one that the

751
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,839
thing that would be the um take the most

752
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,359
time and it really wouldn't be that much

753
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:09,798
time um and it's certainly not

754
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:14,638
particularly hard is to take the let me

755
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:18,158
go back to your um so if I go back here

756
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:21,879
and um if I

757
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:25,360
am if you're putting together these um

758
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,639
lists of evidence and I'm assuming

759
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:29,199
down to somewhere do have like a a

760
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:33,240
bibliography of

761
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,919
these no okay all right so I mean the

762
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,880
other thing too is you can um you okay

763
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,559
so you could create these could all be

764
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,519
yeah um if you're putting these up

765
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,200
anyway and you wanted to make you know

766
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:48,919
they look like they're basically very

767
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:52,960
well annotated um citations you could uh

768
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:57,440
recreate that pretty easily um and the

769
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,600
thing to First do would be to say um you

770
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,120
know you need to get this article from

771
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:05,638
Ratcliffe from the health promotion

772
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:08,199
practice uh journal on here and that you

773
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:09,398
know this is how this would be the only

774
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:11,480
thing that would take a little bit of

775
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:15,319
time is you would probably need to go

776
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,320
you could probably just do this

777
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:22,199
um so there's there's the citation in

778
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,079
Google Scholar um and I would just grab

779
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:27,759
it

780
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:34,079
um and bring it in and so you might need

781
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:37,079
to go a piece at a time um and recreate

782
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,399
your I think it yeah so that that would

783
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,919
be the thing that might take a little

784
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:43,319
bit of time but how how big is how big

785
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:46,279
is your library right now many you know

786
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,519
50 to 100 yeah I don't think it's that

787
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,720
big but what I think is happening is um

788
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,759
some Educators might be you know

789
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,559
creating their own little pile of

790
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,960
references and we're not um we don't

791
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:03,559
have an effective tool to share um and

792
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,480
so if we had that tool like go if you're

793
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:08,358
doing something already you know share

794
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,760
it with the whole um I'm sure Jen has

795
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:14,598
done a lot of of of research related to

796
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,839
her pollinator project and you know we

797
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:21,160
don't have it um in one

798
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,759
place right yeah like Jim does too he's

799
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:25,000
got a lot in there too I I was like

800
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,440
trying to look oh look at all that stuff

801
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,400
yeah I know it's like it's really easy

802
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,800
to add it's like then you're like oh my

803
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,920
gosh and there's no unlike like your

804
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,400
your front hall closet there's no

805
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,760
shortage it's like was there too many

806
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,599
shoes in here it's just like nope you

807
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,880
just you don't run out of room you just

808
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,200
keep putting stuff in there which can be

809
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,358
a curse as well as a blessing I guess

810
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,358
right um so I mean and the other thing

811
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,400
too is if you've done all that really it

812
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:53,559
looks like um you've done uh great work

813
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,440
with these annotations so you could you

814
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:58,400
could pretty easily copy these so in

815
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:03,000
addition to the like the basic citation

816
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,800
information that you would import here

817
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,639
um you can add your own field you could

818
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:12,920
add you that exactly you could go into

819
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:17,400
zoto and put in let me cancel this you

820
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:21,119
could put in your own

821
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,838
um so here here actually is the article

822
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,720
let me get this a little more okay so

823
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:28,719
here's the article and

824
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:31,919
then

825
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:35,759
so here's the citation over here and

826
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,838
then you could put it in um like in the

827
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,720
abstract

828
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:42,279
field

829
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:44,719
um you you just copy and paste it in

830
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,160
there this would be a I'm it would be a

831
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,799
really good project for like an intern

832
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:51,159
yeah that's what I'm

833
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,760
thinking interest just and then you

834
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:56,440
would just use a a uh a style on your

835
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,680
website that would have that would

836
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,559
include include the abstract and you're

837
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:03,399
it would kind of be there it wouldn't

838
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,400
flow as a narrative like this does I

839
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,358
mean that would be the one thing

840
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,760
obviously is I me um you know this is

841
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:13,759
has a nice narrative flow to it um this

842
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,000
would be more like citation uh abstract

843
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,160
citation abstract but you know people

844
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,639
can live with

845
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:23,920
that I suppose so so if you guys want to

846
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:26,759
I know talk among yourselves and see if

847
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,760
that might want to work um I'm you know

848
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,319
send me an email I'm around um and I'm

849
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,480
happy to you know help you get started

850
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:37,239
um it's it's not it's not particularly

851
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,559
hard there's a little bit of um a little

852
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:41,279
bit of things to figure out um and I

853
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:42,440
know everybody's really pressed for time

854
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,920
but I think if you're putting these

855
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,440
things together anyway right um

856
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,599
especially if you have this feeling that

857
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,000
there might be other people out there

858
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,800
who are also collecting this information

859
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,719
you could just add them if you wanted to

860
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,519
if you trusted them you could add them

861
00:37:54,719 --> 00:38:01,358
as editors to the um the library and

862
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:03,639
then they could um add to it um or they

863
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:08,559
could just send you what they have and

864
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:10,920
you could add it um as well so okay um

865
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:13,159
we're we are kind of experimenting with

866
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,838
something along those lines already in a

867
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:16,480
small scale to see if that would work

868
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:19,318
because we are all working on the same

869
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,519
things and it's crazy to keep

870
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:24,400
Reinventing the wheel um and I know that

871
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,960
initially there would be that big time

872
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,880
output you know outlay but then time it

873
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,679
would become more and more efficient and

874
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,519
hopefully we'd see that on that back end

875
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:35,039
when those resources are all gathered

876
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:36,719
for us right right and the other nice

877
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,559
thing too is if you're putting this all

878
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:41,559
like all these list of

879
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:45,119
references um in a in a essentially a

880
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:48,239
database so if your if your website

881
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,838
changed you again you're just pointing

882
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:54,919
to this online site that's not going to

883
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:58,519
change um so you could just link to it

884
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:00,720
and yeah so

885
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:04,838
thanks I think that was really helpful

886
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:07,078
uh um sure um to get us organized on

887
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:10,078
that on that level and basically you

888
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,240
know we're always um eager to find ways

889
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,720
to make it easy for people to explain

890
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,000
why we are

891
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:17,959
important right right right that's an

892
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,199
ongoing right you guys know you're

893
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:23,280
important but exactly one of the things

894
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,598
that we have which I think is kind of

895
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,720
it's it is essentially a credibility

896
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,559
checklist I'm going to back and I'll

897
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:33,799
just I'll show it to you quickly and um

898
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,759
this everything I'm showing you now is

899
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:39,560
you know it's open it's an open resource

900
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,480
so you could either modify it and adapt

901
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:45,559
it to your own use or um just point

902
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,000
people to it there's this section on

903
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:50,599
evaluating credibility which you know we

904
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,599
we teach this to undergraduates and

905
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:56,920
actually it's it seems a little

906
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:59,480
simplistic but it's amazing how if you

907
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:03,240
just tell people okay so you pulled up a

908
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:06,358
website um can you identify the

909
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:09,318
author um of this particular article and

910
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:11,239
what is his or her credentials just by

911
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:13,960
asking them to ask themselves that

912
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:15,199
question you realize most of the time

913
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,760
they don't even ask that they don't even

914
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,318
say well it's like oh well it's a

915
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,400
website it's like well who wrote this

916
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:23,358
and if you can't find an author um

917
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,160
that's probably a red flag and so you

918
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:27,039
kind of go through and the authority the

919
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:30,039
currency the purpose the bias the

920
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,719
accuracy of details and you can this is

921
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:34,119
kind of a a really kind of a mini thing

922
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:38,799
that you could you could put this

923
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:41,280
together in a little Tip Sheet um and um

924
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,680
say if you find a reference on the web

925
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,400
just do this five part checklist and see

926
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,399
what you can do if you wanted to go into

927
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,639
more detail um UC see Berkeley let me

928
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,760
see I haven't looked at this in a while

929
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:53,838
see if the link still works yeah their

930
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,599
Library goes through this in like

931
00:40:53,838 --> 00:41:01,519
extensive detail so this is sort of the

932
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:05,079
the full um the fullon way to and this

933
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:08,400
is usually for evaluating credibility

934
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:12,359
for um web-based resources it you know

935
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,720
it's not really so much for you found

936
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:15,358
you were searching in a database and you

937
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:17,439
found a scholarly article it's more like

938
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:19,519
you Googled the topic and you came

939
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,760
across this and it's just a way you sort

940
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,318
of keep it in the back of your mind it's

941
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:26,640
like what's the authority what's the

942
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:29,039
purpose what um when was this is there

943
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:32,039
is there a list of references there is

944
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,599
there a date it was last updated um

945
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,599
those so there's little things there

946
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,079
that um that exist I I'm I don't know if

947
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,079
that helps but that's that's there and

948
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,200
you can feel free to borrow as much or

949
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:45,839
as little of this um so if you wanted to

950
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:48,078
create a little Tip Sheet for uh the

951
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:50,119
public on this and you included here's

952
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,680
your here five questions to ask in terms

953
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:55,039
of credibility and then you could add

954
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:56,759
the tip that and I think some people

955
00:41:55,039 --> 00:42:02,239
know this but a lot of people people

956
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:04,160
don't um which is that there is

957
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:07,559
um

958
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:09,838
uh there's an advanced Google search

959
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:12,559
where if you go into this you can

960
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,960
actually so it it allows you to string

961
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,838
your search together a little bit better

962
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,358
which is helpful but the other thing too

963
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:21,599
is you can

964
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:25,159
um you can

965
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:29,640
actually go and search by specific

966
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:31,000
domains so you know for example if you

967
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:35,400
were looking

968
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,039
for um compost if I looked for compost

969
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,358
and just did a Google search I'm

970
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:41,119
probably going to get mostly sites that

971
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:42,639
want to sell me compost correct um or

972
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,640
something like that but one of the

973
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:49,199
things you can do um if I limited that

974
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:51,879
to just as an example um if I limited

975
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:55,279
compost to do edu you're mostly going to

976
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:58,000
get know in this case I'm getting um

977
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,200
either EPA or Coral Cooperative

978
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,480
Extension um sites that or the

979
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:07,078
University of Missouri um so if I if I

980
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:11,039
limit it my search to an

981
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:14,318
edu um I'm gonna I'm G to filter out

982
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:16,639
immediately um the commercial sites that

983
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,318
are selling compost and and you could

984
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,159
ALS you don't even have to send them to

985
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:22,960
the advanced search you could just say

986
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:24,039
um you put in your search and at the end

987
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,199
do

988
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:29,079
site.edu

989
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:30,439
if people get into the habit of just

990
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:32,200
instead of throwing the net out in the

991
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,119
lake and pulling back whatever they find

992
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:38,439
is like oh why don't you throw out the

993
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:44,160
net that will only bring back.org stuff

994
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:50,159
or only edu stuff with visual resources

995
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:51,799
how to um use those resources in a way

996
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,719
that U makes

997
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,519
you safe and legal in terms of fair use

998
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:00,879
and those kind of things so that would

999
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:05,318
and I can this this is actually a

1000
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,480
subsection of a guide um oh here's yeah

1001
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:08,159
actually I think this is actually quite

1002
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,159
useful this is the one I was thinking of

1003
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:12,799
image is a guide defining visual

1004
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:15,399
resources so this is this is fully

1005
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,960
available public anybody can get access

1006
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:23,119
to this and it includes a section on um

1007
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,480
copyright um what is fair use the other

1008
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,519
thing you can do in terms of if you're a

1009
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:31,639
staff member if you're actually a um if

1010
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:34,719
you're Cornell Affiliated there's also

1011
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:35,879
if you have specific questions so this

1012
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:37,318
this kind of gives you the guide and you

1013
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,920
can walk through this and it'll answer

1014
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:42,039
most of your questions but if you had

1015
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:45,880
maybe a a a more specific question and

1016
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:48,199
wanted some guidance there is actually a

1017
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:50,760

1018
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:53,639
